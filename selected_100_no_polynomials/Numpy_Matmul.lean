/-- numpy.matmul: Matrix product of two arrays.

    For 1-D arrays (vectors), this function behaves the same as numpy.dot,
    computing the inner product of vectors. It returns the sum of the
    element-wise products of the input vectors.

    Note: For 2-D arrays and higher dimensions, matmul performs matrix
    multiplication following specific broadcasting rules, but for 1-D
    vectors it is identical to the dot product.

  sorry

/-- Specification: numpy.matmul returns the matrix product of two arrays.
    For 1-D vectors, this is the same as the dot product.

    Precondition: True (vectors must have same length, enforced by type)
    Postcondition: result = sum(x1[i] * x2[i] for all i)
