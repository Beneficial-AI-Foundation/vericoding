/-- numpy.bitwise_and: Compute the bit-wise AND of two arrays element-wise.

    Computes the bit-wise AND of the underlying binary representation of 
    the integers in the input arrays. This ufunc implements the C/Python 
    operator &.

    For each pair of corresponding elements in x1 and x2, the result contains
    the bitwise AND of their binary representations. Each bit position in the
    result is 1 only if both corresponding bits in x1 and x2 are 1.

    Examples:
    - 13 & 17 = 1 (binary: 01101 & 10001 = 00001)
    - 14 & 13 = 12 (binary: 01110 & 01101 = 01100)

    Note: This specification currently handles only non-negative integers.
    For negative integers, NumPy uses two's complement representation,
    which requires a more complex formalization in Lean.

/-- Specification: bitwise_and returns a vector where each element is the 
    bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from x1 and x2.

    Precondition: All elements are non-negative (to simplify the specification)
    
    Postcondition: 
    1. For non-negative integers, each element of the result is the bitwise AND 
       of corresponding inputs
    2. The result preserves the mathematical properties of bitwise AND:
       - Commutativity: x & y = y & x
       - Associativity: (x & y) & z = x & (y & z)
       - Identity: x & (2^k - 1) = x for x < 2^k (all 1s acts as identity)
       - Annihilator: x & 0 = 0
       - Idempotence: x & x = x
    3. The result is always less than or equal to both inputs (for non-negative integers)
    4. Each bit in the result is 1 iff both corresponding bits in the inputs are 1
