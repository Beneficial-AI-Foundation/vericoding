List reversal with proofs.
Ported from Dafny specification at:
dafny/benchmarks/dafny-bench_specs/atomizer_supported/dafny_tmp_tmp2ewu6s7x_ListReverse_spec.dfy

This module contains the reverse function for sequences and lemmas about its properties,
including that reverse distributes over append and that reverse is an involution.
