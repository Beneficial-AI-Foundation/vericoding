# Translation Files Cleanup Summary

## Overview

Successfully cleaned up translation files to keep only YAML to Lean translation functionality while removing all Dafny to Lean translation files. All preserved files have been organized into a dedicated `yaml_to_lean_translation/` directory.

## Files Removed (Dafny to Lean Translation)

### Root Directory

- `improved_dafny_to_lean_translator.py`
- `dafny_to_lean_translator.py`
- `translate_dafnybench_to_lean.py`
- `numpy_format_batch_translator.py`
- `improved_batch_translator.py`
- `verify_lean_translations.py`
- `README_dafny_to_lean_pipeline.md`

### Source Directory

- `src/README_DafnyToLean.md`
- `src/test_translation_demo.py`
- `src/dafny_lean_workflow.py`
- `src/dafny_to_lean_translator.py`
- `src/dafny/` (entire directory)

## Files Preserved and Organized (YAML to Lean Translation)

### New Directory: `yaml_to_lean_translation/`

All YAML to Lean translation files have been moved to a dedicated directory:

#### Core Translation Files

- `translate_yaml_to_lean.py` - Main YAML to Lean translator
- `test_translation.py` - Test script for YAML to Lean translation
- `test_api_key.py` - API key validation for translation

#### Documentation

- `README.md` - Overview and usage instructions for the directory
- `README_translation.md` - Detailed documentation for translation process
- `requirements_translation.txt` - Dependencies for translation

## Summary

- **Total files removed**: 11 Dafny to Lean translation files
- **Total files preserved**: 5 YAML to Lean translation files
- **New organization**: All translation files moved to `yaml_to_lean_translation/` directory
- **Cleanup status**: âœ… Complete

## Remaining References

The following files still contain references to Dafny but are appropriate to keep:

- `yaml_to_lean_translation/translate_yaml_to_lean.py` - References Dafny YAML specifications (correct)
- `src/spec_to_code.py` - General spec processor for multiple languages
- Test files - General language testing

## Next Steps

The project now has a clean separation with only YAML to Lean translation capabilities, organized in a dedicated directory. This makes it easier to:

1. **Maintain** - All translation files are in one place
2. **Develop** - Clear focus on YAML to Lean functionality
3. **Deploy** - Self-contained translation module
4. **Document** - Centralized documentation

## Usage

To use the YAML to Lean translation functionality:

```bash
cd yaml_to_lean_translation
pip install -r requirements_translation.txt
python translate_yaml_to_lean.py --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```
