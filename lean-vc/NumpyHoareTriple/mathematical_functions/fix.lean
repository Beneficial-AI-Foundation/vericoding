/-- numpy.fix: Round to nearest integer towards zero, element-wise.
    
    The fix (truncation) of each element x is the integer part of x,
    obtained by discarding the fractional part. This is equivalent to
    rounding towards zero.
    
    For positive numbers: fix(x) = floor(x)
    For negative numbers: fix(x) = ceil(x)
    
    Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the fix of each element.

/-- Specification: numpy.fix returns a vector where each element is the
    fix (truncation towards zero) of the corresponding element in x.
    
    Precondition: True (fix is defined for all real numbers)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] is the fix of x[i], meaning:
    - result[i] is an integer value (represented as Float)
    - |result[i]| ≤ |x[i]| (magnitude is reduced or equal)
    - result[i] has the same sign as x[i] (or zero if x[i] is zero)
    - |x[i] - result[i]| < 1 (difference is less than 1)
    - For positive x[i]: result[i] = floor(x[i])
    - For negative x[i]: result[i] = ceil(x[i])
    - For zero x[i]: result[i] = 0
    - Monotonicity: if x[i] ≤ x[j] then result[i] ≤ result[j]
    - Truncation property: result[i] truncates towards zero
