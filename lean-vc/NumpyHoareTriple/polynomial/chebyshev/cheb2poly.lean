/-- Convert a Chebyshev series to a polynomial.
    
    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a Chebyshev series,
    ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an array of the coefficients
    of the equivalent polynomial (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered
    from lowest to highest degree. -/

/-- Specification: cheb2poly converts Chebyshev coefficients to polynomial coefficients.
    
    The conversion satisfies the mathematical property that if we have Chebyshev series
    ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c[k] * T_k(x) where T_k is the k-th Chebyshev polynomial,
    then the output polynomial coefficients p satisfy:
    ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c[k] * T_k(x) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} p[k] * x^k
    
    Key properties:
    1. Length preservation: output has same length as input
    2. Identity cases: for n ≤ 2, the output equals the input (since T₀(x) = 1, T₁(x) = x)
    3. Correctness: The polynomial form evaluates to the same value as the Chebyshev series
    4. Example verification: [0, 1, 2, 3] → [-2, -8, 4, 12]
    
    The algorithm uses the recurrence relation of Chebyshev polynomials:
    T₀(x) = 1, T₁(x) = x, T_{n+1}(x) = 2xT_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x) -/
