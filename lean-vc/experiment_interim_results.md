# Lean Spec-to-Code Experiment: Interim Results

## Progress Update

As of the current timestamp, the 1-iteration experiment has processed 31 out of 50 files.

### Observed Patterns from Log Analysis

#### Common Error Types

1. **Unknown Constants/Identifiers (Most Common)**
   - `unknown constant 'Id.pure'`
   - `unknown identifier 'Vector.get_zipWith'`
   - `unknown identifier 'Std.Do.hoareTriple_returnPure'`
   - `unknown identifier 'htb_of_pure'`
   - `unknown identifier 'triple_pure'`
   - `unknown identifier 'Std.Do.tripleCompat'`

2. **Type System Errors**
   - `invalid constructor ⟨...⟩, insufficient number of arguments`
   - `Application type mismatch`
   - `type mismatch` in proof goals
   - `failed to synthesize Decidable`

3. **Syntax Errors**
   - `unexpected token ':'; expected '}'`
   - `unexpected token '}'; expected term`
   - `unexpected identifier; expected command`

4. **Proof/Tactic Failures**
   - `tactic 'constructor' failed, target is not an inductive datatype`
   - `tactic 'rfl' failed`
   - `unsolved goals`
   - `no goals to be solved`
   - `simp made no progress`

5. **Declaration Issues**
   - `'Nat.toFloat' has already been declared`
   - `declaration uses 'sorry'` (warnings)

### Success Rate So Far

Based on the log analysis of the first 29 files:
- **Successful implementations**: 0 (with 1 iteration)
- **Failed implementations**: 29
- **Success rate**: 0%

This confirms our hypothesis that 1 iteration is insufficient for most specifications.

### Specific Failure Examples

1. **Numpy_Add.lean**: Failed due to struct syntax and unknown Hoare triple identifiers
2. **Numpy_Multiply.lean**: Constructor argument mismatch and missing vector operations
3. **zeros.lean**: Unknown `Id.pure` constant and type mismatches
4. **Numpy_Sign.lean**: Failed to synthesize decidable instance for equality
5. **Numpy_Dot.lean**: Proof tactic failure - couldn't prove Hoare triple
6. **arange.lean**: Redeclaration of `Nat.toFloat` and constructor issues

### Key Insights

1. **Library Import Issues**: The LLM frequently uses identifiers that don't exist or aren't imported
2. **Hoare Triple Syntax**: The LLM struggles with the specific Hoare triple notation used in this project
3. **Type System Navigation**: Complex type constraints and dependent types pose challenges
4. **Proof Generation**: Even simple proofs fail due to incorrect tactic usage

### Predictions for 5-Iteration Experiment

Based on these patterns, we expect:
- 5-iteration success rate: 15-25% (iterative refinement should help with syntax/import issues)
- Most likely to succeed: Simple arithmetic operations with clear type signatures
- Least likely to succeed: Complex operations requiring sophisticated proofs

### Next Steps

1. Complete 1-iteration experiment
2. Run 5-iteration experiment
3. Analyze which specific operations succeed with more iterations
4. Identify patterns in successful vs. failed implementations
5. Generate final report with visualizations
