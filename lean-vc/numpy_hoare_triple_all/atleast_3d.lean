/-- numpy.atleast_3d: View a 1D vector as a 3D array with shape (1, n, 1).
    
    This is a specialization of numpy.atleast_3d for 1D input.
    The function reshapes a 1D array of shape (n,) into a 3D array 
    of shape (1, n, 1) while preserving all elements.

/-- Specification: atleast_3d transforms a 1D vector into a 3D array where:
    - The output has shape (1, n, 1)
    - Each element arr[i] is accessible at position [0][i][0] in the result
    - All elements are preserved without modification
    - The transformation is injective (different inputs produce different outputs)
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. Element preservation: Every element from the input appears exactly once in the output
    2. Shape expansion: A 1D shape (n,) becomes 3D shape (1, n, 1)
    3. Order preservation: Elements maintain their relative ordering
    4. The output contains exactly n elements total
