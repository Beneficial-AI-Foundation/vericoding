/-- numpy.average: Compute the weighted average along the specified axis.

    Computes the weighted average of the elements in the input vector.
    If weights are not provided, it computes the arithmetic mean.
    If weights are provided, it computes the weighted average where each
    element contributes according to its associated weight.

    The weighted average is computed as:
    sum(a * weights) / sum(weights)

    When weights are not provided, this reduces to:
    sum(a) / len(a)

  sorry

/-- Specification: numpy.average computes the weighted average when weights are provided,
    and arithmetic mean when weights are None.

    Precondition: Array is non-empty and if weights are provided, their sum is non-zero
    Postcondition: Returns the weighted average or arithmetic mean as appropriate
