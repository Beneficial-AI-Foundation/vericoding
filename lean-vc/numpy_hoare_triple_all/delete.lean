/-- numpy.delete: Return a new array with sub-arrays along an axis deleted.

    For a one dimensional array, this returns those entries not returned by
    arr[obj]. The function removes elements at the specified index and
    returns a new array with the remaining elements.

    This specification handles the 1D case where we delete a single element
    at a specified index from a vector.

/-- Specification: numpy.delete removes the element at the specified index and returns
    a new vector containing all other elements in their original order.
    
    The specification ensures:
    1. The result has size n (one less than the input)
    2. Elements before the deleted index maintain their positions
    3. Elements after the deleted index are shifted left by one position
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - Order preservation: Elements maintain their relative order
    - Deletion correctness: The element at the specified index is removed
    - Shift property: Elements after the deleted index have their indices decreased by 1
    
    Sanity checks:
    - The result size is exactly one less than the input size
    - No elements are duplicated or lost (except the deleted one)
    - The deleted element does not appear in the result
    
    Precondition: The array must have at least one element (enforced by type)
    
    Postcondition:
    - For indices i < index: result[i] = arr[i]
    - For indices i ≥ index: result[i] = arr[i+1]
    - The element arr[index] does not appear in the result (unless duplicated elsewhere)
