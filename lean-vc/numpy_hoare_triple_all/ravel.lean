/-- numpy.ravel: Return a contiguous flattened array.

    For 1D arrays, ravel returns the input array unchanged since it's already
    flat. This reflects numpy's behavior where raveling a 1D array has no effect.
    
    For multi-dimensional arrays (not covered here), ravel would flatten them
    into a 1D array following the specified order ('C' for row-major, 'F' for
    column-major, etc.).

/-- Specification: numpy.ravel returns the input vector unchanged for 1D arrays.

    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for 1D ravel)
    Postcondition: The result is identical to the input vector, maintaining
                   all elements in their original order
