/-- ufunc.identity: Get the identity element for a ufunc operation.

    Returns the identity element for a given binary operation, which is the value
    that when combined with any other value using that operation, leaves the other
    value unchanged. For example:
    - Addition: identity is 0 (x + 0 = x)
    - Multiplication: identity is 1 (x * 1 = x)
    - Logical AND: identity is True (x ∧ True = x)
    - Logical OR: identity is False (x ∨ False = x)
    
    Some operations may have no identity element, in which case None is returned.

  -- For most operations, we cannot determine the identity element
  -- without additional information about the operation
  none

/-- Specification: ufunc_identity returns the identity element if it exists.

    Precondition: The operation is a valid binary function
    Postcondition: If an identity element exists, applying the operation with
                   that element leaves any other element unchanged
