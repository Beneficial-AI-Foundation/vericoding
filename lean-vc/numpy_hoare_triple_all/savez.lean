/-- numpy.savez: Save several arrays into a single file in uncompressed .npz format.

    Saves multiple Vector arrays to a single .npz archive file. This operation
    serializes multiple arrays into a single compressed archive, where each array
    is stored as a separate .npy file within the archive.
    
    Key functionality:
    - Multiple arrays can be saved in a single operation
    - Each array is stored with an associated name within the archive
    - The resulting .npz file can be loaded later to recover the arrays
    - Arrays are stored in uncompressed .npy format within the archive
    
    The function takes a file path and multiple arrays to save. For simplicity,
    this specification focuses on saving exactly two arrays (commonly used case).
    
    Security considerations:
    - Pickle support is controlled by allow_pickle parameter
    - Invalid file paths or write permissions can cause failures
    - The archive format ensures data integrity through checksums

/-- Specification: numpy.savez creates a .npz archive containing multiple arrays.

    This specification captures the essential properties of the savez operation:
    
    1. Data Persistence: Arrays are written to disk in a retrievable format
    2. Archive Structure: Multiple arrays are bundled into a single .npz file
    3. Data Integrity: Saved arrays can be loaded with identical values
    4. Name Association: Arrays are stored with identifiable names in the archive
    5. Format Compliance: Output follows .npz format specification
    
    Mathematical Properties:
    - Bijection: There exists a one-to-one correspondence between saved and loaded arrays
    - Preservation: All array values are preserved exactly in the archive
    - Atomicity: Either all arrays are saved successfully or none are saved
    - Idempotence: Saving the same arrays multiple times produces identical files
    
    Security Properties:
    - Pickle safety: Object arrays are only saved when explicitly allowed
    - File system safety: Operation respects file system permissions
    
    Precondition: File path is writable and arrays are valid
    Postcondition: Archive file exists and contains both arrays with recoverable data
