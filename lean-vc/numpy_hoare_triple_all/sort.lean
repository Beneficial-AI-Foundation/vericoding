/-- numpy.sort: Return a sorted copy of an array.

    Returns a new array with the same elements sorted in ascending order.
    The original array is not modified. This function performs a stable sort 
    on the array elements, meaning that when multiple records have the same key,
    their original order is preserved.

    Parameters:
    - a : array_like - Array to be sorted
    
    Returns:
    - sorted_array : ndarray - Array of the same type and shape as a, with elements sorted

/-- Specification: numpy.sort returns a sorted permutation of the input array.

    The specification captures three key properties:
    1. Sorting property: Elements are in non-decreasing order
    2. Permutation property: The result contains exactly the same elements as the input
    3. Stability property: Relative order of equal elements is preserved (implicit in permutation)

    Precondition: True (works for any vector)
    Postcondition: Result is sorted and is a permutation of the input
