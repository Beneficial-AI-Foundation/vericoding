/-- numpy.save: Save an array to a binary file in NumPy .npy format.
    
    Saves Vector data to a binary file in NumPy .npy format. This operation serializes 
    the array data and writes it to disk storage. The function supports:
    - Automatic .npy extension appending if not present
    - Binary format writing for efficient storage and loading
    - Security control via allow_pickle parameter
    
    The file parameter represents the path where the data should be saved.
    For security reasons, object arrays with pickled data should be avoided 
    unless explicitly allowed.
    
    This is a file output operation that creates or overwrites the target file.

/-- Specification: numpy.save persists vector data to disk in a recoverable format.
    
    This specification captures the essential properties of the save operation:
    
    1. Data Persistence: The vector data is written to the specified file
    2. Format Consistency: Data is saved in .npy format for later loading
    3. File Creation: The target file is created or overwritten
    4. Extension Management: .npy extension is added if not present
    5. Security Control: Object arrays are only saved when explicitly allowed
    
    Mathematical Properties:
    - Determinism: Saving the same vector to the same file produces identical results
    - Completeness: All vector elements are preserved in the saved format
    - Recoverability: The saved data can be loaded back to reconstruct the original vector
    - Idempotence: Multiple saves of the same data to the same file yield identical files
    
    Precondition: The file path is valid and writable
    Postcondition: The file exists and contains the serialized vector data
