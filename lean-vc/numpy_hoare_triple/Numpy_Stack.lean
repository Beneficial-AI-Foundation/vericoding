/-- numpy.stack: Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.

    Stack takes multiple arrays and joins them along a new axis.
    For 1D arrays, stacking creates a 2D array where each input
    array becomes a row (axis=0) or column (axis=1).

    Since we're focusing on 1D operations, we'll note that stack
    inherently creates higher-dimensional arrays, so we'll provide
    a specification comment but mark it as out of scope for 1D-only
    implementations.

-- Note: Stack creates 2D arrays from 1D inputs, so we skip implementation
-- for purely 1D operations. Here's what the signature would look like:
-- def numpy_stack {n k : Nat} (arrays : Vector (Vector Float n) k) (axis : Nat) :
--     Id (Array2D Float) := sorry


Specification comment for numpy.stack (not implemented for 1D-only):

Stack would take k arrays of length n and create:
- If axis=0: a k×n array where each input is a row
- If axis=1: a n×k array where each input is a column

Since this creates 2D arrays, it's outside our 1D-only scope.
