/-- numpy.tensordot: Compute tensor dot product along specified axes.
    
    Given two tensors a and b, and axes, sums the products of a's and b's 
    elements over the axes specified. For 1-D arrays (vectors) with axes=1,
    this computes the inner product of vectors.
    
    This specification focuses on the 1-D case with axes=1, which is equivalent
    to the dot product operation.

/-- Specification: tensordot computes the tensor dot product along specified axes.
    
    For 1-D vectors with axes=1, this is equivalent to the inner product:
    result = sum(a[i] * b[i] for i in 0..n-1)
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - Commutative: tensordot(a, b, 1) = tensordot(b, a, 1)
    - Bilinear: tensordot(α*a + β*c, b, 1) = α*tensordot(a, b, 1) + β*tensordot(c, b, 1)
    - Zero vector: tensordot(zeros, b, 1) = 0
    - Self-product: tensordot(a, a, 1) = ||a||²
    
    Precondition: axes = 1 (for 1-D vector case)
    Postcondition: result equals the sum of element-wise products
