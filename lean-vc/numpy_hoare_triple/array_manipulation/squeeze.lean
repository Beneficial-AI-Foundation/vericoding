/-- Squeeze a single-element vector to extract its value.
    This is a simplified 1D version of numpy.squeeze for vectors of size 1. -/
def squeeze {α : Type} (a : Vector α 1) : Id α :=
  sorry

/-- Specification: squeeze extracts the single element from a size-1 vector.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. The result equals the first (and only) element of the input vector
    2. For any function f, squeeze preserves function application: f(squeeze(a)) = f(a[0])
    3. squeeze is the inverse of creating a single-element vector
    
    Sanity checks:
    - The input must be a vector of exactly size 1
    - The output type changes from Vector to the element type
    - This models numpy's behavior where squeeze([x]) returns x as a 0D array -/
