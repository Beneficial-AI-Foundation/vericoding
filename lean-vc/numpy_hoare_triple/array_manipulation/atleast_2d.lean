/-- numpy.atleast_2d: View inputs as arrays with at least two dimensions.
    
    For a 1D vector input, this function converts it to a 2D array (matrix)
    with shape (1, n), where the input becomes the single row of the matrix.
    
    This specification focuses on the 1D to 2D case, which is the most common
    use case for ensuring arrays have at least 2 dimensions.

  sorry

/-- Specification: atleast_2d converts a 1D vector to a 2D matrix with one row.
    
    This specification includes:
    1. Sanity check: The result has exactly 1 row
    2. Shape property: The result's shape is (1, n) where n is the input length
    3. Value preservation: All elements from the input are preserved in order
    4. Mathematical property: The operation is essentially a row vector representation
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
    Postcondition: 
    - The result is a matrix with 1 row and n columns
    - The single row contains all elements from the input vector in the same order
    - The transformation preserves all numerical values exactly
