/-- Interpret the input as a matrix. In our simplified model, this represents
    a 1D vector as a matrix type. Since numpy.asmatrix doesn't make a copy
    if the input is already a matrix or ndarray, this function acts as an
    identity operation with matrix type semantics. -/
def asmatrix {n : Nat} (data : Vector Float n) : Id (Vector Float n) :=
  pure data

/-- Specification: asmatrix interprets input data as a matrix without copying.
    
    The function preserves the original data structure and values while
    providing matrix semantics. For our Vector-based implementation, this
    means the output vector has the same length and contains the same elements
    as the input vector.
    
    Key properties:
    1. No copying occurs - the result has the same elements as input
    2. The length is preserved  
    3. Element order is preserved
    4. All original values are maintained -/
