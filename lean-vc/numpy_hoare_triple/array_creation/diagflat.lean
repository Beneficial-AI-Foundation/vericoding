/-- numpy.diagflat: Create a two-dimensional array with the flattened input as a diagonal.

    Takes an input vector (representing flattened data) and creates a square matrix
    where the input values appear along the k-th diagonal. The parameter k determines
    which diagonal to use: k=0 for main diagonal, k>0 for super-diagonals,
    and k<0 for sub-diagonals.

    For simplicity, we focus on the main diagonal case (k=0) and return a 1D flattened
    representation of the square matrix.

/-- Specification: diagflat creates a square matrix with input values on the main diagonal.

    Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
    Postcondition: The result is a flattened square matrix where:
    1. The input vector v appears along the main diagonal
    2. All other elements are zero
    3. The matrix has dimensions n × n (flattened to n² elements)
