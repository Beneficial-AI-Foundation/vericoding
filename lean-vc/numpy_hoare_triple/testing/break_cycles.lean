/-- Break reference cycles by forcing garbage collection.
    This function performs multiple garbage collection passes to ensure
    that reference cycles are broken and temporary objects are freed.
    It is primarily used for testing and cleanup purposes.
    Returns Unit as it performs side effects only. -/

/-- Specification: break_cycles performs garbage collection side effects.
    Since this is a side-effect only function that doesn't take parameters
    or return meaningful values, the specification focuses on the invariants
    and properties that should hold after execution.
    
    This specification captures the core properties:
    - Sanity check: The function returns Unit (no meaningful return value)
    - Mathematical property: The function is idempotent (calling multiple times has same effect)
    - Side effect property: Memory cleanup occurs (modeled abstractly)
    - Testing property: Function is deterministic in its return value -/
