/-- numpy.dot: Dot product of two arrays.

    For 1-D arrays (vectors), this is the inner product of vectors.
    It computes the sum of the element-wise products of the input vectors.

    If both a and b are 1-D arrays, it is inner product of vectors
    (without complex conjugation).

/-- Specification: numpy.dot returns the dot product (inner product) of two vectors.

    Precondition: True (vectors must have same length, enforced by type)
    Postcondition: result = sum(a[i] * b[i] for all i)
