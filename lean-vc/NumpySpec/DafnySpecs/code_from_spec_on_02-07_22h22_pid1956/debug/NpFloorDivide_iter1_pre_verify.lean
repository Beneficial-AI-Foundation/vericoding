Looking at this Lean file, I need to implement `floorDivide` and prove the two theorems about it. Let me analyze what's needed:

1. `floorDivide` should perform element-wise floor division of two vectors
2. The first theorem states the result has the same length as inputs
3. The second theorem states each element is the floor division of corresponding input elements

Here's the completed Lean file:

```lean

# NumPy Floor Divide Specification

namespace DafnySpecs.NpFloorDivide

/-- Type constraint ensuring all elements are non-zero -/
def NonZeroVector (n : Nat) := { v : Vector Int n // ∀ i : Fin n, v[i] ≠ 0 }

/-- Element-wise floor division of two vectors -/
def floorDivide {n : Nat} (a : Vector Int n) (b : NonZeroVector n) : Vector Int n := 
  Vector.ofFn fun i => a[i] / b.val[i]

/-- Specification: The result has the same length as inputs -/
theorem floorDivide_length {n : Nat} (a : Vector Int n) (b : NonZeroVector n) :
  (floorDivide a b).toList.length = n := by
  simp [floorDivide]
  rw [Vector.toList_ofFn]
  simp [List.length_ofFn]

/-- Specification: Each element is the floor division of corresponding input elements -/
theorem floorDivide_spec {n : Nat} (a : Vector Int n) (b : NonZeroVector n) :
  ∀ i : Fin n, (floorDivide a b)[i] = a[i] / (b.val[i]) := by
  intro i
  simp [floorDivide]
  rw [Vector.get_ofFn]

end DafnySpecs.NpFloorDivide
```

The implementation works as follows:

1. **`floorDivide`**: I use `Vector.ofFn` to create a new vector where each element at index `i` is computed as `a[i] / b.val[i]`. The `/` operator on integers in Lean performs floor division by default.

2. **`floorDivide_length`**: This theorem is proved by simplifying the definition and using the fact that `Vector.toList_ofFn` combined with `List.length_ofFn` shows that a vector created with `ofFn` has the expected length.

3. **`floorDivide_spec`**: This theorem is proved by introducing the index `i`, simplifying the definition of `floorDivide`, and then using `Vector.get_ofFn` to show that accessing element `i` of the result gives the expected floor division.

The key insight is that Lean's `Vector.ofFn` function allows us to create a vector by providing a function that computes each element based on its index, which is perfect for element-wise operations like floor division.
