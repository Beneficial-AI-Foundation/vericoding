## How many sorries is too many?

If you sorry the definitions involved in sorried theorems, it becomes unclear what you are even talking about (and obviously it's not possible to prove the theorem while it has a compromised statement). 

## imports

imports must be before any syntax elements including module and doc comments.

```lean
/-!
illegal: import must go above or this comment should be a regular multiline comment (`/- .. -/`)
 -/

import Mathlib
```
