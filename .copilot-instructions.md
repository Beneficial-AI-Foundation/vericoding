# VeriCoding - Lean 4 Verification Project

**Project Focus**: Formal verification experiments with Lean 4 + MCP tools integration.

**Key Guidelines for AI Assistance**:
- Use Lean 4 for formal verification (build with `lake build`)
- Python package management with `uv` (NOT pip)
- Prefer jj over git for version control
- Follow "sorry-friendly programming" - use specs with `sorry` vs comments
- Use named holes `?holeName` for incremental development
- Variable naming: `r`/`c` not `i`/`j`, `R`/`C` not `m`/`n`
- MCP tools available: lean_goal, lean_diagnostic_messages, etc.
- Common Lean pitfalls: implicit parameters, have vs let, Prop vs Bool
