/-- numpy.power: First array elements raised to powers from second array, element-wise.

    Raise each base in x1 to the positionally-corresponding power in x2.
    x1 and x2 must be broadcastable to the same shape.

    This is equivalent to x1 ** x2 in terms of array operations.

/-- Specification: numpy.power returns a vector where each element is x1[i] raised
    to the power of x2[i].

    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for basic power operation)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = x1[i] ^ x2[i]
