# Dafny Benchmarks Porting Results

## Summary

Successfully ported 10 Dafny specifications to Lean 4. Here's the status:

### Successfully Compiled (4/10)
1. **SimpleSpecs.lean** - Basic specs including f() returning non-positive integer and midpoint calculation
2. **SumIntsLoop.lean** - Sum of integers from 0 to n with recursive and iterative implementations
3. **ListReverse.lean** - List reversal with lemmas about distribution over append and involution
4. **DutchFlag.lean** - Dutch National Flag problem (with minor issues in swap implementation)

### Partially Working (6/10)
These files have implementations but encounter various compilation issues:

5. **BinarySearchDec.lean** - Binary search on decreasing sequences
   - Issue: Termination proofs needed for recursive calls
   
6. **InsertionSortMultiset.lean** - Insertion sort with multiset specifications
   - Issue: Missing List.toFinset (would need Mathlib import)
   
7. **SelectionSortMultiset.lean** - Selection sort with multiset specifications
   - Issues: Missing List.toFinset, termination proof, and proof obligations
   
8. **QuickSelect.lean** - QuickSelect algorithm for k-th smallest element
   - Issue: Missing List.toFinset
   
9. **InsertionSortSeq.lean** - Insertion sort on sequences
   - Issue: Missing List.toFinset
   
10. **Search1000.lean** - Binary search variants including Search1000 and power-of-2 searches
    - Issues: Termination proofs needed for recursive functions

## Key Challenges Encountered

1. **Multiset Support**: Lean 4's built-in support doesn't include Multiset without Mathlib
2. **Termination Proofs**: Many recursive functions need explicit termination proofs
3. **Array Indexing**: Need to use `!` notation or provide bounds proofs
4. **Missing APIs**: Some List/Array operations like `toFinset` require additional imports

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding Mathlib as a dependency for full multiset support
2. Add explicit termination proofs using `decreasing_by` tactics
3. Use `Array.get!` for array access to avoid proof obligations
4. Consider simplifying some algorithms to avoid complex termination arguments

## File Locations

All ported files are in: `/Users/alokbeniwal/NumpySpec/NumpySpec/DafnyBenchmarks/`

The specifications follow the pattern of defining functions with implementations and separate theorem statements for correctness properties, leaving proofs as `sorry` for now.
