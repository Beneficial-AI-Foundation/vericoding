Dafny to Lean 4 Porting Log
==========================

This directory contains Lean 4 ports of Dafny specifications from the vericoding/dafny/benchmarks/dafny-bench_specs/atomizer_supported/ directory.

Files Ported:
1. Clover_abs_spec.dfy -> Abs.lean
2. Clover_all_digits_spec.dfy -> AllDigits.lean
3. Clover_array_append_spec.dfy -> ArrayAppend.lean
4. Clover_array_concat_spec.dfy -> ArrayConcat.lean
5. Clover_array_copy_spec.dfy -> ArrayCopy.lean
6. Clover_array_product_spec.dfy -> ArrayProduct.lean
7. Clover_array_sum_spec.dfy -> ArraySum.lean
8. Clover_avg_spec.dfy -> Avg.lean
9. Clover_below_zero_spec.dfy -> BelowZero.lean
10. Clover_binary_search_spec.dfy -> BinarySearch.lean

Porting Notes:
- All specifications use the Hoare triple style with ⦃⌜precondition⌝⦄ program ⦃⇓result => ⌜postcondition⌝⦄
- Proofs are left as `sorry` for future completion
- Some adjustments were made for Lean 4 syntax:
  - String indexing uses `s.get i` instead of `s[i]`
  - Array element-wise operations use `Array.ofFn` instead of non-existent `Array.zipWith`
  - List operations like `scanl` were reimplemented manually where not available
  - Array indexing with proofs uses notation like `a[i.val]'(by sorry)`

Compilation Status:
✓ All 10 files compile successfully

Implementation Notes:
- The `mvcgen` tactic is experimental and was removed in favor of direct `sorry` proofs
- Some array indexing requires explicit proofs of bounds, currently handled with `by sorry`
- BelowZero uses a mutable state approach inspired by human-eval-lean PR #185
- String indexing uses `s.data.get i` to access characters by index
