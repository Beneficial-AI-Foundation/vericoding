/-- Specification: trace computes the sum of the main diagonal elements of a square matrix.
    The trace is mathematically defined as the sum of elements x[i][i] for i from 0 to n-1.
    This is a fundamental operation in linear algebra with important mathematical properties:
    - trace(A + B) = trace(A) + trace(B) (linearity)
    - trace(cA) = c * trace(A) (scalar multiplication)
    - trace(A) = trace(A^T) (transpose invariance) -/
