/-- numpy.divmod: Return element-wise quotient and remainder simultaneously.

    Performs element-wise division returning both the quotient and remainder.
    For each pair of elements (x, y), returns (x // y, x % y) where:
    - x // y is the floor division (largest integer ≤ x/y)
    - x % y is the remainder such that x = y * (x // y) + (x % y)
    
    This is equivalent to (x // y, x % y) but faster because it avoids
    redundant work by computing both values in a single operation.
    
    From NumPy documentation:
    - Parameters: x1, x2 (array_like) - The dividend and divisor arrays
    - Returns: (quotient, remainder) - tuple of ndarrays with element-wise results
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. Division identity: x1[i] = x2[i] * quotient[i] + remainder[i]
    2. Remainder bounds: 0 ≤ |remainder[i]| < |x2[i]| (for positive divisors)
    3. Sign consistency: remainder has same sign as divisor (Python % semantics)

/-- Specification: numpy.divmod returns a tuple of vectors containing the quotient 
    and remainder of element-wise division.

    Mathematical Properties:
    1. Division identity: For all i, x1[i] = x2[i] * quotient[i] + remainder[i]
    2. Quotient correctness: quotient[i] = floor(x1[i] / x2[i])
    3. Remainder correctness: remainder[i] = x1[i] - x2[i] * quotient[i]
    4. Remainder bounds: |remainder[i]| < |x2[i]| (when x2[i] ≠ 0)
    5. Sign consistency: remainder[i] has same sign as x2[i] (Python % semantics)
    6. Equivalence: divmod(x1, x2) = (floor_divide(x1, x2), mod(x1, x2))
    
    Precondition: All elements in x2 must be non-zero
    Postcondition: Returns (quotient, remainder) where the mathematical properties hold
