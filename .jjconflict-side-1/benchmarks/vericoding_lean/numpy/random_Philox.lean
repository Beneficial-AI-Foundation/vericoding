/-- Philox (4x64) pseudo-random number generator.
    
    Philox is a counter-based RNG that generates pseudo-random numbers
    using a counter and key. It provides high-quality random numbers
    with a large period (2^256 - 1) and supports parallel generation.
    
    The core operation takes a seed and generates a vector of random
    numbers in the range [0, 1).

/-- Specification: Philox generates pseudo-random numbers with deterministic behavior.
    
    The Philox algorithm has several key mathematical properties:
    1. Deterministic: same seed produces same sequence
    2. Uniform distribution: values are uniformly distributed in [0, 1)
    3. Range constraint: all values are in the half-open interval [0, 1)
    4. Reproducibility: identical seeds produce identical sequences
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
    Postcondition: All values are in [0, 1) and sequence is deterministic based on seed
