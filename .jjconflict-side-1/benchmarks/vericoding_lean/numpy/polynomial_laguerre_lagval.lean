/-- Evaluate a Laguerre series at points x using Clenshaw recursion.
    The mathematical formula for the Laguerre series is:
    p(x) = c_0 * L_0(x) + c_1 * L_1(x) + ... + c_n * L_n(x)
    where L_i(x) are the Laguerre polynomials. -/

/-- Specification for Laguerre series evaluation:
    The result has the same shape as the input x vector.
    For a single coefficient, the result is constant.
    For multiple coefficients, the function evaluates the Laguerre series
    using Clenshaw recursion, which is numerically stable. -/
