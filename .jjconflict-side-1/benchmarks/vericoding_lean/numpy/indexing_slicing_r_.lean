/-- numpy.r_: Translates slice objects to concatenation along the first axis.
    
    This is a simple way to build up arrays quickly. There are two main use cases:
    1. If the index expression contains comma separated arrays, then stack them along their first axis
    2. If the index expression contains slice notation or scalars then create a 1-D array with a range
    
    This implementation focuses on the first use case - concatenating two 1D arrays along the first axis.
    The r_ object provides a convenient way to concatenate arrays by using index notation.
    
    For example, numpy.r_[array1, array2] concatenates array1 and array2.

/-- Specification: numpy.r_ concatenates arrays along the first axis.
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for basic concatenation)
    Postcondition: The result contains all elements from the first array followed by all elements from the second array.
    This comprehensive specification captures:
    1. First n elements come from array a (preserving order and values)
    2. Next m elements come from array b (preserving order and values)
    3. Total length is n + m (enforced by type system)
    4. No elements are duplicated or lost (bijective mapping)
    5. The concatenation preserves all original values exactly
    6. Order is preserved within each original array
