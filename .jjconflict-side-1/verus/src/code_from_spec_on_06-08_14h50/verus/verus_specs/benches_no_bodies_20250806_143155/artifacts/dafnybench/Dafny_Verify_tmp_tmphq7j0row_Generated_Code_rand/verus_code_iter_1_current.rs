- `requires`: `(x_init as int) * (y as int) <= u32::MAX as int` - this is a precondition that must hold when the function is called
- `ensures`: `z == 0` - this means the return value must be 0

Since the ensures clause requires that the return value `z` equals 0, the implementation is straightforward - I just need to return 0.

use vstd::prelude::*;

verus! {
    fn main_method(x_init: u32, y: u32) -> (z: u32)
        requires 
            (x_init as int) * (y as int) <= u32::MAX as int,
        ensures z == 0
    {
        0
    }
}

fn main() {}
