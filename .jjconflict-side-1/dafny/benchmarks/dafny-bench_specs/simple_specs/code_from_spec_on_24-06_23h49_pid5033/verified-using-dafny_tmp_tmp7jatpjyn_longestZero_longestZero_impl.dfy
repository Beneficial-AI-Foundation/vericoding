I need to see the actual Dafny code to help you fix the verification errors. The input you've provided only shows an `ensures` clause that appears to be part of a larger specification, but I need to see the complete file with the ATOM and IMPL blocks to provide a proper solution.

Could you please provide the complete Dafny file that contains:
1. The ATOM blocks (if any)
2. The IMPL blocks with the method/function signatures, requires/ensures clauses, and current implementation
3. Any helper functions or predicates that are referenced (like `getSize` in your example)

Once I have the complete code, I can:
- Fix any compilation errors first
- Address verification issues
- Add necessary proof annotations
- Ensure the implementation satisfies all the specifications

Please share the full Dafny file so I can provide you with a working solution.
