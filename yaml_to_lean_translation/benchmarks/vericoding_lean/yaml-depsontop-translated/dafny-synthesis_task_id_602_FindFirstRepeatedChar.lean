Finds the first repeated character in a string.
Returns:

Specification for FindFirstRepeatedChar:
- If a repeated character is found (found = true):
  - There exist indices i,j where the character at i equals the character at j
  - This is the first such repeated character
- If no repeated character is found (found = false):
  - No two characters in the string are equal

theorem FindFirstRepeatedChar_spec (s : String) :
  let (found, c) := FindFirstRepeatedChar s
  (found → ∃ i j, 0 ≤ i ∧ i < j ∧ j < s.length ∧ 
    s.get i = s.get j ∧ s.get i = c ∧
    (∀ k l, 0 ≤ k ∧ k < l ∧ l < j ∧ s.get k = s.get l → k ≥ i)) ∧
  (!found → ∀ i j, 0 ≤ i ∧ i < j ∧ j < s.length → s.get i ≠ s.get j) := sorry
