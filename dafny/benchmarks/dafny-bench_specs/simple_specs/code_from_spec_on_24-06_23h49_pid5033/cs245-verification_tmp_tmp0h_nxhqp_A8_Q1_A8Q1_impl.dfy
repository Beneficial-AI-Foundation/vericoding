// There is no definition for power, so this function will be used for validating that our imperative program is correct. This is just for Dafny.
function power(a: int, n: int): int //function for a to the power of n
requires 0 <= n
/* code modified by LLM (iteration 1): Added recursive implementation of power function */
{
    if n == 0 then 1
    else a * power(a, n - 1)
}

//IMPL A8Q1

requires y0 >= 0

/* Proof of implieds can be seen on LEARN.
  Note: If you are unconvinced, putting asserts for each condition will demonstrate the correctness of the statements.
