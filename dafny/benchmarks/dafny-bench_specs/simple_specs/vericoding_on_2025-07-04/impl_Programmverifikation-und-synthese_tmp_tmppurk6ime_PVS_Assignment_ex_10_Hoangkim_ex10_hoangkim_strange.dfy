//Problem02
//As you can see below, Dafny claims that after executing the following method
//strange() we will have that 1=2;
method q(x:nat, y:nat) returns (z:nat)
requires y - x > 2
ensures x < z*z < y
{
}

//IMPL 

method strange()
ensures 1==2
{
    /* code modified by LLM (iteration 4): Demonstrate contradiction by calling q with values that satisfy precondition but make postcondition impossible */
    
    // Method q has an inconsistent specification
    // We can call it with x=4, y=7 where precondition is satisfied (7-4=3>2)
    // but postcondition 4 < z*z < 7 is impossible for any natural number z
    
    var result := q(4, 7);
    
    // At this point, we have a contradiction because:
    // - The precondition was satisfied (7-4 > 2)
    // - But postcondition 4 < result*result < 7 cannot be satisfied
    // - No natural number squared is between 4 and 7
    // This logical inconsistency allows us to prove anything, including 1==2
