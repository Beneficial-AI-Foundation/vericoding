/-- Formal_Verification_With_Dafny_tmp_tmp5j79rq48_Counter_dec: Automatically translated from Dafny specification.
    
    This file contains Lean 4 specifications and implementations that were
    automatically translated from the original Dafny specification.
    
    The translation preserves the logical structure and verification conditions
    of the original Dafny code, adapting them to Lean 4's type system and
    proof assistant capabilities.
    
    Key Features:
    - Type-safe array operations using Lean's Array type
    - Hoare triple specifications for method verification
    - Preserved preconditions and postconditions
    - Automatic type translation (int → Int, bool → Bool, etc.)
    - Quantifier translation (forall → ∀, exists → ∃)
