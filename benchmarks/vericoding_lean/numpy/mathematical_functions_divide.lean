/-- numpy.divide: Divide arguments element-wise.

    Divides two vectors element-wise. If the vectors have the same shape,
    each element of the result is the quotient of the corresponding elements
    from the input vectors.

    This is equivalent to x1 / x2 in terms of array broadcasting.
    Division by zero results in infinity or NaN according to IEEE 754 standard.

/-- Specification: numpy.divide returns a vector where each element is the quotient
    of the corresponding elements from x1 and x2.

    Precondition: True (handles division by zero according to IEEE 754)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = x1[i] / x2[i]
    
    Additional properties:
    - When x2[i] ≠ 0, result[i] * x2[i] = x1[i] (within floating point precision)
    - When x2[i] = 0 and x1[i] ≠ 0, result[i] is infinite
    - When x2[i] = 0 and x1[i] = 0, result[i] is NaN
