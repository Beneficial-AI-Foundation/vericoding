  sorry

/-- Specification: hermgauss returns quadrature points and weights that satisfy key properties:
    1. The points are roots of the deg-th Hermite polynomial
    2. The weights are positive
    3. The weights sum to a positive value (specifically sqrt(π))
    4. The quadrature exactly integrates polynomials up to degree 2*deg - 1 with weight exp(-x²)
    5. Points are symmetric around 0 and are distinct -/
