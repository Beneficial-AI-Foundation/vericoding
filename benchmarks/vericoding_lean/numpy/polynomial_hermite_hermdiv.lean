/-- Divide one Hermite series by another.
    
    Returns the quotient-with-remainder of two Hermite series
    c1 / c2. The arguments are sequences of coefficients from lowest
    order term to highest, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series
    P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2.
    
    Parameters:
    - c1: 1-D array of Hermite series coefficients (dividend)
    - c2: 1-D array of Hermite series coefficients (divisor)
    
    Returns:
    - (quo, rem): Pair of arrays representing quotient and remainder

/-- Specification: hermdiv divides Hermite series c1 by c2, producing quotient and remainder
    such that c1 = c2 * quo + rem in the Hermite polynomial basis, where the degree of rem
    is less than the degree of c2. The divisor must have at least one non-zero coefficient. -/
