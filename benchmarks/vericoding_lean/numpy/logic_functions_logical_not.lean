/-- numpy.logical_not: Compute the truth value of NOT x element-wise.

    For each element in the input array, applies logical NOT operation.
    In NumPy's interpretation: any non-zero numeric value is considered True 
    (so NOT returns False), zero is considered False (so NOT returns True).
    
    Returns a boolean array of the same shape as the input.

/-- Specification: numpy.logical_not returns a vector where each element is the
    logical NOT of the corresponding element in x, following NumPy's truthiness rules.

    Precondition: True (logical NOT is defined for all numeric values)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = true iff x[i] = 0.0
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - Exactly implements NumPy's truthiness rules: 0.0 → true, non-zero → false
    - Element-wise operation preserves array shape and size (enforced by type)
    - Idempotent when composed with itself and appropriate conversion
    - For special float values: logical_not(NaN) = false, logical_not(∞) = false
    - Boundary case: logical_not(-0.0) = true (since -0.0 = 0.0)
