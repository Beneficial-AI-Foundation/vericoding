/-- numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebcompanion: Return the scaled companion matrix of c.

    The basis polynomials are scaled so that the companion matrix is
    symmetric when c is a Chebyshev basis polynomial. This provides
    better eigenvalue estimates than the unscaled case and for basis
    polynomials the eigenvalues are guaranteed to be real if
    numpy.linalg.eigvalsh is used to obtain them.

    Parameters:
    - c : 1-D array of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to high degree

    Returns:
    - mat : Scaled companion matrix of dimensions (deg, deg) where deg = len(c) - 1

/-- Specification: chebcompanion returns a scaled companion matrix with specific structure.

    Precondition: The input vector has at least 2 elements (enforced by type)
    
    Postcondition: The result is an (n+1) × (n+1) matrix where:
    1. The superdiagonal and subdiagonal have specific values (0.5 for most entries, sqrt(0.5) for the first)
    2. The last column is adjusted by scaled coefficients
    3. The matrix structure ensures symmetry for Chebyshev basis polynomials
