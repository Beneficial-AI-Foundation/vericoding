/-- Broadcast a 1D vector to a 2D matrix by repeating it along rows.
    This implements the most common broadcasting pattern: (n,) -> (m, n) -/
def broadcast_to {n m : Nat} (v : Vector Float n) : Id (Vector (Vector Float n) m) :=
  sorry

/-- Specification: broadcast_to creates a 2D matrix where each row is a copy of the input vector.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. Shape property: The result has shape (m, n) where n is the original vector length
    2. Value property: Each row in the result equals the original vector
    3. Broadcasting rule: A 1D array of shape (n,) can be broadcast to (m, n) by repeating
    4. Row consistency: All rows in the result are identical to the input vector
    5. Element preservation: Each element in the input appears m times in each column
    
    Sanity checks:
    - The output shape is exactly (m, n)
    - Every row contains the same values as the input vector
    - Broadcasting preserves element values without modification
    - The result behaves as if v was copied m times along a new axis
    
    Example behavior:
    - Input: [1, 2, 3] with target shape (2, 3)
    - Output: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
    
    Additional properties:
    - Memory efficiency: In NumPy, this creates a view, not a copy
    - Column-wise view: Column j contains m copies of v[j]
    - Broadcasting compatibility: The result can be used in element-wise operations with other (m, n) arrays
    
    Mathematical formulation:
    - For input vector v ∈ ℝⁿ and target shape (m, n)
    - Output matrix M ∈ ℝᵐˣⁿ where M[i,j] = v[j] for all i ∈ {0,...,m-1}, j ∈ {0,...,n-1}
