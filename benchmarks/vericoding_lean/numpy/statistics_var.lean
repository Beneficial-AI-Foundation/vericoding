If, however, ddof is specified, the divisor N - ddof is used instead. In standard statistical practice, ddof=1 provides an unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite population. ddof=0 provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables.",

/-- Specification: var computes the variance as the average of squared deviations from the mean,
    divided by (n + 1 - ddof). The variance measures the spread of a distribution.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. The result is always non-negative
    2. The variance is zero if and only if all elements are equal
    3. The computation requires ddof < n + 1 to ensure a positive divisor
    4. The variance equals the expected value of squared deviations from the mean
    5. Translation invariance: var(a + c) = var(a) for any constant c
    6. Scaling property: var(c * a) = c^2 * var(a) for any constant c
    
    The variance formula implemented is:
    var = (1/(n+1-ddof)) * sum_{i=0}^{n} (a[i] - mean)^2
    where mean = (1/(n+1)) * sum_{i=0}^{n} a[i]
    
    This specification captures both the mathematical definition of variance
    and its key properties. When ddof=0, this gives the population variance;
    when ddof=1, this gives the sample variance (unbiased estimator). -/
