vc-postamble: "/*(a). Do you have an explanation for this behaviour?\n    Answer: \n    the method strange() doesn't have any input or output. This method initializes\n    variable x with value 4. Then it calculates variable c as a result of calling\n    method 'q' with x as first var and 2*x as second var.the strange method does not \n    specify any postcondition. Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions about the \n    behavior or the value of c after calling q.\n    We can change ensures in strange() to false and it's still verified\n*/\n\n/*(b)\n{\n  assume{:axiom} false;\n}var x:nat := 4; var c := q(x,2*x); {1 = 2 }\n    precond in strange(): difference between 'y' and 'x' muss be greater than 2,\n    square from 'z' will be a value  between 'x' and 'y'\n\n    apply the Hoare rules step by step:\n    1. {true} as a precondition\n    2. we assign 4 to 'x' and having {4=4}\n    3. assign value q(x, 2 * x) to c, substitute the postcondition of 'q' in place of 'c'\n        post cond of\
