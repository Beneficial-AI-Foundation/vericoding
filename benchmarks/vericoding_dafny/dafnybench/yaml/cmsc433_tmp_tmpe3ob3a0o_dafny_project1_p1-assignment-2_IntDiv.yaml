  // ASSIGNMENT P1
  // CMSC 433 FALL 2023
  // PERFECT SCORE:  100 POINTS
  //
  // This assignment contains nine questions, each of which involves writing Dafny
  // code. You should include your solutions in a single Dafny file and submit it using
  // Gradescope.

  // 2023-09-22 2:50 pm   Fixed typo in Problem 3.


  // Question 1 (5 points)
  //
  // Fill in a requires clause that enables Dafny to verify
  // method PlusOne



  // Question 2 (5 points)
  //
  // Fill in requires clause(s) that enable(s) Dafny to verify the array bounds
  // in method Swap (which swaps elements i and j in array a).


  // Question 3 (5 points)
  //
  // Give ensures clause(s) asserting that d is the result, and r the
  // remainder, of dividing m by n.  Your clauses cannot use "/" or "%" (which are
  // the Dafny division and mod operators, respectively). By definition, the
  // remainder must be non-negative.

vc-postamble: "// Question 4 (5 points)\n//\n// Give ensures clause(s) asserting that the return value has the same\n// length as array a and contains as its elements the sum of the\n// corresponding elements in arrays a and b.\n\n\n// Question 5 (10 points)\n\n// Euclid's algorithm is used to compute the greatest common divisor of two\n// positive integers.  If m and n are two such integers, then gcd(m,n) is the\n// largest positve integer that evenly divides both m and n, where j evenly divides i\n// if and only if i % j == 0 (% is the Dafny mod operator).  Write requires and\n// ensures clauses for the method header Euclid below.  Your requires clauses\n// should also specify that the first argument is at least as large as the second.\n// You do *not* need to implement the method!\n\n\n// Question 7 (20 points)\n//\n// Implement, and have Dafny verify, the method IsPrime below, which returns true\n// if and only if the given positive integer is prime.\n\n\n// Question 8 (20 points)\n\
  //\n// Implement, and have Dafny verify, the method Reverse below, which returns a new array\n// aRev consisting of the elements of a, but in reverse order.  To create a new \n// array of ints use the Dafny command \"new int[...]\", where \"...\" is the number\n// of elements in the array.\n\n\n// Question 9 (20 points)\n//\n// Implement and verify method NoDups, which returns true if and only if there\n// are no duplicate elements in array a.  Note that the requires clause allows\n// you to assume that a is sorted, and that this precondition is necessary for\n// the ensures clause to imply a lack of duplicates."
