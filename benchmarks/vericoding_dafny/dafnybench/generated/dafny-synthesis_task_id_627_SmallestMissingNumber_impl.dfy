The problem is that we increment `v` first, then `i`, but the invariant is checked after each statement. When we increment `v`, we have `s[i] >= v - 1` (the old value of `v`), but we need `s[i] >= v` (the new value).

Let me trace through what happens:
- Before the loop body: `s[i] == v` (from the loop condition)
- After `v := v + 1`: now `s[i] == v - 1`, so `s[i] >= v` might not hold
- After `i := i + 1`: if `i < |s|`, we need `s[i] >= v`

The key insight is that since the sequence is sorted (non-decreasing), if `s[i-1] == v-1`, then `s[i] >= s[i-1] = v-1`, and since all elements are integers and the sequence is sorted, we actually have `s[i] >= v`.

However, I need to fix the loop body to ensure the invariant is maintained. The issue is in the order of operations and the invariant itself.

<vc-spec>
method SmallestMissingNumber(s: seq<int>) returns (v: int)
    requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] <= s[j]
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> s[i] >= 0
    ensures 0 <= v
    ensures v !in s
    ensures forall k :: 0 <= k < v ==> k in s
</vc-spec>

<vc-code>
{
    v := 0;
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |s| && s[i] == v
        invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
        invariant 0 <= v
        invariant v == i
        invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < v ==> k in s
        invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < i ==> s[k] == k
        invariant i < |s| ==> s[i] >= v
    {
        i := i + 1;
        v := v + 1;
    }
}
