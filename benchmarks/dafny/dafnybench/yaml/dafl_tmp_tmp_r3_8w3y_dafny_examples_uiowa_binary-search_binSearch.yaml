  /* Note: the following definition of isSorted:
  
  
  although equivalent to the one above is not enough for Dafny to be able 
  to prove the invariants for the loop in binSearch.
  
  The given one works because it *explicitly* states that every element 
  of the input array is smaller than or equal to all later elements. 
  This fact is implied by the alternative definition of isSorted given 
  here (which only talks about array elements and their successors). 
  However, it needs to be derived as an auxiliary lemma first, something 
  that Dafny is not currently able to do automatically.
