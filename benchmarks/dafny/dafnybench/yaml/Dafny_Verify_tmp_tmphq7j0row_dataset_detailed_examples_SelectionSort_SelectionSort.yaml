  // Works by dividing the input list into two parts: sorted and unsorted. At the beginning, 
  
  // the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part contains all the elements.
  
  // Ensures the final array is sorted in ascending order
  
  // Ensures that the final array has the same elements as the initial array
