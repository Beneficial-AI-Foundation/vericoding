Given three brothers numbered 1, 2, and 3, exactly two brothers arrived on time 
for a meeting and one brother was late. Given the numbers of the two brothers who 
arrived on time, determine the number of the brother who was late.

predicate ValidBrotherNumbers(a: int, b: int)
{
  1 <= a <= 3 && 1 <= b <= 3 && a != b
}

function LateBrother(a: int, b: int): int
  requires ValidBrotherNumbers(a, b)
{
  6 - a - b
}

predicate IsValidResult(a: int, b: int, result: int)
{
  ValidBrotherNumbers(a, b) ==> 
    (1 <= result <= 3 && result != a && result != b)
}

method solve(a: int, b: int) returns (result: int)
  requires ValidBrotherNumbers(a, b)
  ensures IsValidResult(a, b, result)
  ensures result == LateBrother(a, b)
{
  result := 6 - a - b;
}
