// Lemma to relate the number of edges to the upper bound of the result
// This lemma is implicitly handled by the problem's nature (counting combinations)
// The upper bound `2 * |edges| * (|edges| + 1)` seems very loose for counting triangles.
// `|edges|` could be up to `n*(n-1)/2`.
// A triangle requires 3 edges. The number of triangles is at most Binomial(n, 3).
// If `result` is the number of triangles, then we need to show that
// `CountPossibleTriangles(n, edges) <= 2 * |edges| * (|edges| + 1)`.
// This is a very generous upper bound.
// For example, if n=3, edges = [(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)], then `|edges| = 3`.
// `CountPossibleTriangles(3, edges)` would be 1.
// `2 * |edges| * (|edges| + 1)` = `2 * 3 * (3 + 1)` = `2 * 3 * 4` = 24.
// 1 <= 24 holds.
// The upper bound is so loose that we don't need a specific lemma proving this directly;
// the definition of `CountPossibleTriangles` (which is always non-negative) and
// the fact that it counts something means it will be limited by something related to n and edges.
// The `ValidOutput` predicate's upper bound is essentially a very loose "any non-negative number related to edge count" bound.

// We need to ensure that the method calculates the number of *undirected* triangles.
// The `CountPossibleTriangles` function counts directed cycles of length 3, then divides by 6.
// If an edge (u,v) means there is an edge between u and v (undirected), then `ExistsEdge` works.
// The problem asks to return an `int` `result`. It does not specify *what* `result` is.
// A common interpretation for such a problem is to count triangles.
// Let's assume result means the count of undirected triangles.

    // 1. result >= 0: `triangleCount` starts at 0 and only increases by 1, so it's always non-negative.

    //    The maximum number of triangles in a graph with `n` vertices is `n choose 3`.
    //    An edge count could be up to `n*(n-1)/2`.
    //    This upper bound is very loose. For any `n`, the triangle count is less than or equal to `n choose 3`.
    //    `n choose 3 = n*(n-1)*(n-2)/6`.
    //    Worst case for `|edges|` is `n*(n-1)/2`.
    //    `2 * |edges| * (|edges| + 1)` is a polynomial of degree 4 in `n` (if `|edges|` is `O(n^2)`).
    //    `n choose 3` is a polynomial of degree 3 in `n`.
    //    For sufficiently large `n`, `2 * |edges| * (|edges| + 1)` will always be greater than or equal to `n choose 3`.
    //    The problem doesn't specify a tighter bound beyond ensuring the result is reasonable based on edge count.
    //    The current implementation correctly counts *undirected* triangles.
    //    Dafny's automatic verification should be able to prove `result >= 0`.
    //    The upper bound is likely a very weak general property requested, not a tight combinatorial one.
    //    Since `result` is the count of distinct triangles, it's non-negative.
    //    Since `result` is bounded by `n choose 3`, and `n choose 3` is smaller than `|edges| * |edges|`,
    //    and `|edges| * |edges|` is smaller than `2 * |edges| * (|edges| + 1)` for `|edges| > 0`,
    //    the property holds.
