{
  // If b >= a, then since a > 0, we have a - f < a. So b >= a - f.
  // The predicate NoRefuelNeeded already includes b >= f and b >= a - f.
  // We need to show that if NoRefuelNeeded holds, then JourneyCount returns 0.
  // JourneyCount(a, b, f) returns 0 if b >= f && b >= a - f && b >= 2 * a - f.
  // From NoRefuelNeeded, we have b >= f and b >= a - f.
  // We also have b >= a. Since f < a, it implies a > f, so a - f < a.
  // 2*a - f = a + (a - f). Since b >= a, we need to show b >= a + (a - f).
  // This is not directly implied by b >= a.
  // Let's re-evaluate JourneyCount.
  // JourneyCount returns 0 if:
  // NOT (b < f) AND NOT (b < a - f) AND NOT (b < 2*a - f)
  // which means b >= f AND b >= a - f AND b >= 2*a - f.
  // NoRefuelNeeded states b >= a && b >= f && b >= a - f.
  // We need to prove b >= 2*a - f from NoRefuelNeeded.
  // Since f < a and a > 0, then a - f > 0 is not guaranteed (e.g. f = a - 1).
  // However, a - f < a.
  // If b >= a, then 2*a - f can be rewritten as a + (a - f).
  // If f > 0, then a - f < a.
  // If a - f <= 0: This implies a <= f, which contradicts f < a. So a - f > 0.
  // Therefore, a - f is a positive value.
  // Because b >= a, we know b is at least a.
  // And 2*a - f can be greater than 'a'.
  // Example: a=10, f=1. 2a-f = 20-1=19. If b=10, NoRefuelNeeded is true (10>=10, 10>=1, 10>=9).
  // But JourneyCount(10,10,1) would be 2 because b=10 < 2a-f=19.
  // This means the NoRefuelNeeded predicate needs to be fixed OR the lemma is not provable for JourneyCount.

  // Let's analyze the original intent. NoRefuelNeeded means one full tank is enough for the "round trip".
  // Which typically means b >= 2*a - f for a specific type of logic.
  // However, the current JourneyCount implies 0 journeys if b is large enough.
  // The original problem description states that 0 journeys means "never leaves the starting city".
  // So a single tank can cover the entire round trip.
  // If b >= 2*a - f, it is sufficient for the whole round trip with one refuel, or even no refuel in some configurations.
  // The original definition of NoRefuelNeeded looks at single-trip properties.
  // The provided JourneyCount function calculates something different.

  // Let's align NoRefuelNeeded to the JourneyCount function's definition of 0 journeys.
  // For JourneyCount to return 0, we need b >= f, b >= a - f, AND b >= 2 * a - f.
  // The current NoRefuelNeeded is b >= a && b >= f && b >= a - f.
  // If we only care about k=1 case as per the requires clause and assume result must be 0 for 'no refuel needed',
  // then actual 'no refuel needed' in single journey case with current JourneyCount means b >= a.
  // If b >= a, then:
  // 1. b >= f (because outer if condition 'b < f' would have caught it)
  // 2. b >= a - f (because a > 0 and f < a implies a - f < a, so b >= a implies b >= a - f)
  // 3. b >= 2*a - f: This is not necessarily true given b >= a.
  // The lemma `lemma_NoRefuelNeeded_implies_ZeroJourneys` as currently written for `NoRefuelNeeded` and `JourneyCount` is not generally true.

  // The original problem statement for the `solve` method's `SingleJourneyResult` postcondition implies:
  // k == 1 && result >= 0 ==> ( (b >= a && result == 0) || (b < a && b >= f && result == 1) )
  // This means if k=1 and b >= a, result should be 0.
  // If k=1 and b < a, and b >= f, result should be 1.
  // This is what the `solve` method implements.
  // The JourneyCount function and NoRefuelNeeded seem to be based on a different model.
  // If the goal is to make `solve` pass verification, we need to ensure the lemmas
  // support the logic in `solve` rather than a possibly distinct `JourneyCount`.

  // Let's redefine `NoRefuelNeeded` to reflect the condition `b >= a` as used in `solve` for k=1 and result 0.
  // This redefinition makes the lemma hold true based on the `solve` method's logic.
  // Similarly, `lemma_SingleRefuelNeeded_valid` should reflect `b < a && b >= f && b >= a - f`.
}

// Redefining NoRefuelNeeded for the context of prove for the `solve` method for k=1 and result 0.

  requires NoRefuelNeeded_For_SingleJourney_K1(a, b, f)
  // This lemma needs to prove SingleJourneyResult implies result == 0 when b >= a.
  // But SingleJourneyResult is a postcondition of solve, not directly proved by this lemma about JourneyCount.
  // The original error was `lima_NoRefuelNeeded_implies_ZeroJourneys(a, b, f);`
  // This means the goal was to call a lemma to prove something about JourneyCount.
  // However, solve method doesn't use JourneyCount to determine its result for k=1.
  // It directly uses b >= a.

  // So, the original lemma was perhaps trying to prove `JourneyCount(a,b,f) == 0` when `b >= a`.
  // As shown above, this is generally false for `JourneyCount` as defined initially.
  // For example, JourneyCount(10, 10, 1) is 2 because 10 < 2*10 - 1 = 19.
  // But `solve(10, 10, 1, 1)` should return 0 based on `b >= a`.

  // The `solve` method's logic is simpler and seems directly aligned with the `SingleJourneyResult` postcondition.
  // Therefore, the issue is that the lemma call for `JourneyCount` is out of place or wrong for the new definition.

  // Let's remove the helper lemma related to `JourneyCount` entirely if `solve` doesn't depend on it.
  // If `solve` needs to verify `SingleJourneyResult`, then we need to prove `(b >= a && result == 0)` or `(b < a && b >= f && result == 1)`.

  // The original error: `unresolved identifier: lima_NoRefuelNeeded_implies_ZeroJourneys`
  // implies it looked for `lima_NoRefuelNeeded_implies_ZeroJourneys` but found `lemma_NoRefuelNeeded_implies_ZeroJourneys`.
  // So the fix is just to rename the lemma call in `solve`.
  // And the second error `expected method call, found expression` suggests it was trying to pass the arguments `a, b, f` as if they were part of an expression inside a method call, which is strange.
  // The original error might be a copy-paste error from an older version of the code or a typo during generation.

  // Let's try to make the lemma match the fix needed in the code.
  // The `solve` function reaches `result := 0` when `k == 1` and `b >= a`.
  // At this point, we need to justify `SingleJourneyResult(a, b, f, k, result)` which means `b >= a && result == 0`.
  // This is directly true by the `if b >= a` branch. No complex lemma is needed.
  // The original `lima_NoRefuelNeeded_implies_ZeroJourneys` seems like a legacy or misapplied proof helper.
  // Removing the helper proves the point that the helper was trying to prove something not directly relevant or required by the `solve` methods current logic given its postconditions.

  // We should make the lemma consistent with the `solve` method's logic.
  // The `NoRefuelNeeded` predicate for `solve`'s case of `result = 0` when `k = 1` is simply `b >= a`.
  // We need to leverage `ValidInput` and the outer `else` conditions.
