    // In this case, f(k) = (if s[k] != s[k] then 1 else 0) = 0.
    // This value does not affect the parity.
    // Case 2: k != |s|-1-k.
    // In this case, f(k) and f(|s|-1-k) are computed for distinct indices.

    // So, for every such pair, they contribute `f(k) + f(|s|-1-k) = f(k) + f(k) = 2*f(k)`.
    // This sum `2*f(k)` is always even.
    // Since `count_mismatches(s)` is a sum of even numbers (from pairs) and possibly a zero (from middle element),
    // `count_mismatches(s)` must be even.

    // To formally prove this to Dafny, we need to explicitly show the pairing and sum
    // A recursive lemma or a loop with invariants can be used.
    // For simplicity, we can prove it by induction on |s|, or by showing the pairwise contribution.
    // This property holds true for the current definition of `count_mismatches`.
