vc-description: |-
  Two athletes Willman and Bolt compete in a race with step lengths w and b meters respectively.
  The race distance L is chosen uniformly at random from integers 1 to t (inclusive).
  Each athlete can take at most floor(L/step_length) steps, traveling floor(L/step_length) * step_length distance.
  They tie when they travel the same total distance: floor(L/w) * w = floor(L/b) * b.
  Find the probability that they tie, expressed as an irreducible fraction.
