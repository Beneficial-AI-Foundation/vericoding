vc-description: |-
  Given N mountains indexed from west to east with heights, count how many mountain inns 
  allow ocean visibility. Mountain 1 (westmost) always has visibility. Mountain i (i â‰¥ 2) 
  has visibility if and only if its height is greater than or equal to the maximum height 
  of all mountains to its west.
