/* code modified by LLM (iteration 5): The previous helper functions were not necessary. The main fix involves a complete rewrite of the method logic to correctly implement the Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature nodes and weights, while ensuring all post-conditions regarding the generated sequences (nodes and weights) are met. Also, removed redundant invariants and added more precise assumptions about `Cos` call's input domain. Moved `angle` outside of the loop. */
