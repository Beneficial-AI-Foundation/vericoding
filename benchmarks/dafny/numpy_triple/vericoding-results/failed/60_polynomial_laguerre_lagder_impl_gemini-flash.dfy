/* code modified by LLM (iteration 5): Fixed `index out of range` and `postcondition not proved` errors. The issue with `current_coeffs[j]` being out of bounds was due to `current_coeffs` having length `n`, but the loop for `j` might attempt `j` up to `n-1` where `current_coeffs` only has indices up to `n-1`. For `next_coeffs`, it was correctly sized but `current_coeffs` when it becomes `next_coeffs` in the next iteration. For the `LagDer` method, after differentiation, the degree of the polynomial reduces by `m`, so `current_coeffs` should also reduce in size. This iteration correctly resizes `current_coeffs` and `next_coeffs` in each differentiation round. If `m >= n`, the result is now correctly an array of zeros. The `sum_val` loop condition has been carefully adjusted to ensure `j` is within bounds of the `current_coeffs` array which correctly shrinks with each iteration. It ensures all relevant ensures clauses are met. */
