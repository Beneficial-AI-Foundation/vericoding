vc-description: |-
  Linear polynomial representation module.
  
  This module provides functionality to create coefficient vectors for linear polynomials
  of the form off + scl*x, following NumPy's convention where coefficients are ordered
  from lowest to highest degree.

  // Method that creates a coefficient vector for the linear polynomial off + scl*x

vc-spec: |-
  method polyline(off: real, scl: real) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // The result is always a 2-element sequence representing polynomial coefficients
    ensures |result| == 2
    
    // Constant term is always off (coefficient of x^0)
    ensures result[0] == off
    
    // Linear coefficient is always scl (coefficient of x^1)
    ensures result[1] == scl
    
    // Mathematical property: polynomial evaluation at x=0 gives the constant term
    ensures result[0] + result[1] * 0.0 == off
    
    // Mathematical property: polynomial evaluation at x=1 gives off + scl
    ensures result[0] + result[1] * 1.0 == off + scl
    
    // The coefficients correctly represent the linear polynomial off + scl*x
    ensures forall x: real {:trigger result[1] * x} :: result[0] + result[1] * x == off + scl * x
