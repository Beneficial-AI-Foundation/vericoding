  This file implements the numpy.shape operation for returning the shape of an array.
  For one-dimensional arrays (sequences), the shape is simply the length of the sequence.
  This corresponds to numpy.shape behavior for 1D arrays where it returns a tuple with
  a single element representing the array length.

  method Shape<T>(a: seq<T>) returns (result: nat)
    // No preconditions - shape is defined for all sequences
    ensures result == |a|  // The shape equals the length of the input sequence
