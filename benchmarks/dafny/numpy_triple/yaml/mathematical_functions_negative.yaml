  Dafny specification for numpy.negative: Numerical negative operation, element-wise.
  Computes the negative of each element in the input array, equivalent to -x in terms of array operations.
  Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the negated values.

  method NumpyNegative(x: array<real>) returns (result: array<real>)
    // No preconditions required for negation operation
    ensures result.Length == x.Length  // Result has same length as input
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < x.Length ==> result[i] == -x[i]  // Each element is negated
