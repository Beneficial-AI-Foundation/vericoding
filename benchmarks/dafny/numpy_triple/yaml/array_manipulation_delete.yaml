  method Delete(arr: seq<real>, index: nat) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Preconditions: array must be non-empty and index must be valid
    requires |arr| > 0
    requires index < |arr|
    
    // Postcondition: result has exactly one fewer element
    ensures |result| == |arr| - 1
    
    // Postcondition: elements before the deleted index maintain their positions  
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < index ==> result[i] == arr[i]
    
    // Postcondition: elements after the deleted index are shifted left by one
    ensures forall i :: index <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == arr[i + 1]
    
    // Postcondition: every element except the deleted one appears in the result
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |arr| && i != index ==> 
      exists j :: 0 <= j < |result| && result[j] == arr[i]
