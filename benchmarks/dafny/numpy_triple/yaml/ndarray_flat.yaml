vc-description: |-
  Dafny specification for numpy.ndarray.flat operation.
  Provides a flattened view of an array, which for 1D arrays is essentially
  an identity operation that maintains element order and values.
vc-preamble: |-
  // Method that implements numpy flat operation for 1D arrays
  // For 1D arrays, this provides a view with the same elements in the same order

vc-spec: |-
  method numpy_flat(a: array<real>) returns (result: array<real>)
    ensures result.Length == a.Length
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> result[i] == a[i]
