  Dafny specification for numpy.hstack: Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).
  
  For 1D arrays, hstack stacks arrays horizontally by concatenating them
  along the first axis. This is equivalent to concatenation for 1D arrays.
  This version handles stacking two 1D arrays.

  method hstack(a: seq<real>, b: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // No preconditions needed for 1D concatenation
    requires true
    
    // The result has length equal to the sum of input lengths
    ensures |result| == |a| + |b|
    
    // First |a| elements come from array a, preserving order
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> result[i] == a[i]
    
    // Next |b| elements come from array b, preserving order  
    ensures forall j :: 0 <= j < |b| ==> result[|a| + j] == b[j]
