  This file implements the numpy.atleast_1d function for vectors, which
  acts as an identity function since vectors already have at least one dimension.
vc-preamble: |-
  // For vectors that already have at least one dimension, atleast_1d is identity
vc-helpers: |-
  
vc-spec: |-
  method AtLeast1D(arr: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
      ensures result == arr
