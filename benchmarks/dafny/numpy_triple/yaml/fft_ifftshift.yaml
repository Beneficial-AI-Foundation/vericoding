vc-description: |-
  Dafny specification for numpy.fft.ifftshift - the inverse of fftshift.
  
  This function performs the inverse operation of fftshift, moving the
  zero-frequency component from the center back to the beginning of the array.
  For even-length arrays, it is identical to fftshift.
  For odd-length arrays, it differs by one sample position.

  method ifftshift(x: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    requires |x| > 0
    ensures |result| == |x|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |x| ==> 
      result[i] == x[(i + |x| / 2) % |x|]
