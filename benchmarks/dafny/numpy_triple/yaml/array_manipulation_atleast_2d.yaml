  numpy.atleast_2d: View inputs as arrays with at least two dimensions.
  
  This file specifies the behavior of converting 1D vectors to 2D matrices
  with exactly one row, ensuring arrays have at least 2 dimensions.

   * Converts a 1D vector to a 2D matrix with exactly one row.
   * The input vector becomes the single row of the resulting matrix.

  method atleast_2d(arr: Vector1D) returns (result: Matrix2D)
      ensures |result| == 1  // Result has exactly 1 row
      ensures |result| > 0 ==> |result[0]| == |arr|  // Row has same length as input
      ensures |result| > 0 ==> result[0] == arr  // Single row matches input exactly
      ensures |result| > 0 ==> forall i :: 0 <= i < |arr| ==> result[0][i] == arr[i]  // Element preservation
