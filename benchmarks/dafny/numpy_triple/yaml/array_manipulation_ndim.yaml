vc-description: |-
  Implementation of numpy.ndim functionality for returning the number of dimensions of an array.
  In this vector-based framework, all vectors are 1-dimensional arrays, so ndim always returns 1.
vc-preamble: |-
  // Method to return the number of dimensions of a vector (always 1 in this framework)
vc-helpers: |-
  
vc-spec: |-
  method ndim<T>(a: seq<T>) returns (result: int)
      // No preconditions - works for any vector
      ensures result == 1
      // All vectors in our framework are 1-dimensional arrays regardless of their element type or size
