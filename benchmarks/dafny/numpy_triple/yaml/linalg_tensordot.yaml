  Tensor dot product computation for 1-D vectors.
  When axes=1, computes the inner product (dot product) of two vectors,
  which is the sum of element-wise products.

  function SumProduct(a: seq<real>, b: seq<real>): real
    requires |a| == |b|

    if |a| == 0 then 0.0

  method tensordot(a: seq<real>, b: seq<real>, axes: nat) returns (result: real)
    // Precondition: axes must be 1 for 1-D vector case
    requires axes == 1
    // Precondition: vectors must have same length
    requires |a| == |b|
    // Postcondition: result equals sum of element-wise products
    ensures result == SumProduct(a, b)
