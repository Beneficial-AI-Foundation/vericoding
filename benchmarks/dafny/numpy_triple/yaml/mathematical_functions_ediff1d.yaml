  Dafny specification for numpy.ediff1d: computes differences between consecutive elements.
  Equivalent to numpy's ediff1d function which returns [b-a, c-b, d-c] for input [a, b, c, d].
  Always returns a 1D array with length one less than the input.

  method numpy_ediff1d(ary: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Input array must have at least one element
    requires |ary| >= 1
    // Result has length n for input of length n+1
    ensures |result| == |ary| - 1
    // Each element represents difference between consecutive elements: result[i] = ary[i+1] - ary[i]
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == ary[i+1] - ary[i]
