  This file implements the argmax function which returns the index of the maximum value in a non-empty sequence.
  The function finds the position of the largest element, returning the first occurrence in case of ties.

  method argmax(a: seq<real>) returns (index: nat)
    // Precondition: sequence must be non-empty
    requires |a| > 0
    // Postcondition: returned index is valid for the sequence
    ensures 0 <= index < |a|
    // Postcondition: element at returned index is maximum (greater than or equal to all other elements)
    ensures forall j :: 0 <= j < |a| ==> a[j] <= a[index]
    // Postcondition: returned index is the first occurrence of the maximum value
    ensures forall j :: 0 <= j < |a| && a[j] == a[index] ==> index <= j
