  This file implements matrix flattening functionality that converts a 2D matrix
  into a 1D vector using row-major (C-style) ordering, equivalent to numpy.ndarray.flatten.

vc-spec: |-
  method Flatten(mat: seq<seq<real>>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Precondition: matrix must be rectangular (all rows have the same length)
    requires |mat| == 0 || forall i :: 0 <= i < |mat| ==> |mat[i]| == |mat[0]|
    
    // Postcondition: result length equals rows * cols  
    ensures |result| == |mat| * (if |mat| == 0 then 0 else |mat[0]|)
    
    // Postcondition: elements are preserved in row-major order
    ensures |mat| > 0 ==> forall row, col :: 0 <= row < |mat| && 0 <= col < |mat[0]| ==>
      result[row * |mat[0]| + col] == mat[row][col]
