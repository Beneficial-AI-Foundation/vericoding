  method NPY_SQRT1_2() returns (result: real)
      // The result is the square root of 1/2, so its square equals 0.5
      ensures result * result == 0.5
      // The result is positive
      ensures result > 0.0
      // The result equals 1 divided by the square root of 2
      ensures result * result * 2.0 == 1.0
      // The result is approximately the known mathematical value
      ensures result >= 0.707106781186547524400844362104849038
      ensures result <= 0.707106781186547524400844362104849040
