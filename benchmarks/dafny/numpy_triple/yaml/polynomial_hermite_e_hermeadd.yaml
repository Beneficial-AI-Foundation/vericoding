  Implementation of Hermite polynomial addition (hermeadd).
  This module provides component-wise addition of Hermite polynomial coefficients,
  which corresponds to mathematical polynomial addition where coefficients of like
  terms are summed together.
vc-preamble: |-
  // Component-wise addition of two Hermite polynomial coefficient sequences
  // Returns a sequence representing the sum of two Hermite series c1 + c2
  // Coefficients are ordered from lowest to highest degree terms
vc-helpers: |-
  
vc-spec: |-
  method hermeadd(c1: seq<real>, c2: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // The result length is the maximum of input lengths
    ensures |result| == if |c1| >= |c2| then |c1| else |c2|
    
    // Core coefficient addition property: each coefficient is sum of corresponding coefficients
    // Missing coefficients from shorter sequences are treated as zero
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==>
      result[i] == (if i < |c1| then c1[i] else 0.0) + (if i < |c2| then c2[i] else 0.0)
