  This file implements a vectorization function that applies a scalar function
  element-wise to a vector, similar to NumPy's vectorize functionality.

  // Method that vectorizes a scalar function to operate element-wise on sequences

vc-spec: |-
  method Vectorize<T, U>(f: T --> U, input: seq<T>) returns (result: seq<U>)
      // Input sequence can be of any length
      requires true
      // Output sequence has same length as input
      ensures |result| == |input|
      // Each element of result is f applied to corresponding element of input
      ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |input| ==> result[i] == f(input[i])
