  Dafny specification for numpy.logical_not: Compute the truth value of NOT x element-wise.
  Implements NumPy's logical NOT operation with truthiness rules where 0.0 maps to true
  and all non-zero values (including NaN and infinity) map to false.
vc-preamble: |-
  /**
   * Computes the logical NOT of each element in the input sequence according to NumPy semantics.
   * Uses NumPy's truthiness convention: zero is falsy (NOT zero = true), 
   * all non-zero values are truthy (NOT non-zero = false).

  method LogicalNot(x: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<bool>)
    ensures |result| == |x|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |x| ==> result[i] == (x[i] == 0.0)
