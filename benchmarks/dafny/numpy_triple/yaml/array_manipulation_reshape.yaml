vc-description: |-
  Numpy reshape operation specification for 1D arrays.
  Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.
  This implementation focuses on 1D to 1D reshaping where the total number
  of elements is preserved. Elements maintain their linear order.

  method reshape(a: seq<real>, newSize: nat) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // The new size must equal the original size (no data is lost or added)
    requires |a| == newSize
    // The result has the specified new size
    ensures |result| == newSize
    // All elements are preserved in their original linear order
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < newSize ==> result[i] == a[i]
