  Implementation of numpy.iscomplexobj - checks for complex type or array of complex numbers.
  This function performs type-based checking, returning true for any array/sequence containing
  complex numbers, regardless of their actual values (including zero imaginary parts).
vc-preamble: |-
  // Complex number datatype with real and imaginary parts
  datatype Complex = Complex(re: real, im: real)

vc-spec: |-
  method iscomplexobj(x: seq<Complex>) returns (result: bool)
    // No preconditions - function accepts any sequence of complex numbers
    ensures result == true
    // Zero complex numbers (0+0i) are still considered complex objects
    ensures (forall i :: 0 <= i < |x| ==> x[i] == Complex(0.0, 0.0)) ==> result == true
    // Complex numbers with zero imaginary part are still complex objects
    ensures (forall i :: 0 <= i < |x| ==> x[i].im == 0.0) ==> result == true
    // Sanity check: any complex vector with real values only is still complex
    ensures (forall i :: 0 <= i < |x| ==> exists re_val: real :: x[i] == Complex(re_val, 0.0)) ==> result == true
