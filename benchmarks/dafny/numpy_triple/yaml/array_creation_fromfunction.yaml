  This file implements a specification for numpy.fromfunction, which constructs
  an array by executing a function over each coordinate index.
  For the 1D case, this creates a vector where element i is f(i).
vc-preamble: |-
  // Function type that maps indices to real values
  // Note: f will only be called with indices in range [0, n)
  type IndexFunction = nat -> real
  
  // Construct a vector by executing a function over each coordinate index
  // Creates a vector of length n where element i is f(i)
vc-helpers: |-
  
vc-spec: |-
  method fromfunction(n: nat, f: IndexFunction) returns (result: seq<real>)
    requires n >= 0
    ensures |result| == n
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> result[i] == f(i)
