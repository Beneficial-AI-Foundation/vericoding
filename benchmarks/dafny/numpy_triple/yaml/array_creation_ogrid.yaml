vc-description: |-
  Creates a 1D open grid of evenly spaced floating point values from start to stop.
  This is a simplified version of numpy.ogrid that handles the common case of
  creating a single evenly-spaced vector with n points.

  method ogrid(start: real, stop: real, n: nat) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Precondition: must have at least one point
    requires n > 0
    // Postcondition: result has exactly n elements
    ensures |result| == n
    // For single element case, it equals start
    ensures n == 1 ==> result[0] == start
    // For multiple elements, they are evenly spaced from start to stop
    ensures n > 1 ==> (forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> 
      result[i] == start + (i as real) * ((stop - start) / ((n - 1) as real)))
