  numpy.log2: Base-2 logarithm of x, element-wise.
  The base-2 logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function with base 2,
  so that log2(2^x) = x. This is useful for computing the number of bits needed
  to represent a number or for operations involving powers of 2.
  Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the base-2 logarithm
  of each element in x.
