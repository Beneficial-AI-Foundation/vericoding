  Specification for numpy.dstack: Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).
  
  This function takes a sequence of 1D arrays and stacks them along a new third axis,
  creating a 3D array where each input array becomes a "slice" in the depth dimension.
vc-preamble: |-
  // 3D array type: outer dimension (always 1) -> rows -> depth elements
  type Array3D = seq<seq<seq<real>>>

  method numpy_dstack(arrays: seq<seq<real>>) returns (result: Array3D)
    requires |arrays| > 0
    // All input arrays must have the same length
    requires forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |arrays| && 0 <= j < |arrays| ==> |arrays[i]| == |arrays[j]|
    
    ensures |result| == 1
    // The single outer element has the same number of rows as the input array length
    ensures |arrays| > 0 ==> |result[0]| == |arrays[0]|
    // Each row has as many elements as there are input arrays (depth dimension)
    ensures |arrays| > 0 ==> forall i :: 0 <= i < |result[0]| ==> |result[0][i]| == |arrays|
    // Correct element positioning: result[0][i][j] = arrays[j][i]
    ensures |arrays| > 0 ==> forall i, j :: 
      0 <= i < |arrays[0]| && 0 <= j < |arrays| ==> 
      result[0][i][j] == arrays[j][i]
