  This file implements numpy.r_ functionality for concatenating arrays along the first axis.
  The r_ object provides a convenient way to concatenate arrays, focusing on the main use case
  of concatenating two arrays while preserving order and values.
vc-preamble: |-
  // Method that concatenates two sequences along the first axis
  // Equivalent to numpy.r_[array1, array2] which concatenates array1 and array2
vc-helpers: |-
  
vc-spec: |-
  method r_(a: seq<real>, b: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // No preconditions - concatenation works for any two sequences
    // Postcondition: result length equals sum of input lengths
    ensures |result| == |a| + |b|
    // Postcondition: first |a| elements of result match elements of a (preserving order)
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> result[i] == a[i]
    // Postcondition: next |b| elements of result match elements of b (preserving order)
    ensures forall j :: 0 <= j < |b| ==> result[|a| + j] == b[j]
