vc-description: |-
  Polynomial addition functionality for adding two polynomials represented as coefficient sequences.
  Coefficients are ordered from lowest to highest degree terms, where [1,2,3] represents 1 + 2*x + 3*x^2.
vc-preamble: |-
  // Function to add two polynomials represented as coefficient sequences
    
    // Each coefficient in the result is the sum of corresponding coefficients,
    // with implicit zero-padding for shorter polynomials
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |PolyAdd(c1, c2)| ==>
      PolyAdd(c1, c2)[i] == 
        (if i < |c1| then c1[i] else 0.0) +
        (if i < |c2| then c2[i] else 0.0)
    
    // Commutativity property: order of operands doesn't matter
    ensures PolyAdd(c1, c2) == PolyAdd(c2, c1)
    
    // Zero identity properties: adding zero polynomial doesn't change result
    ensures c1 == [] ==> PolyAdd(c1, c2) == c2
    ensures c2 == [] ==> PolyAdd(c1, c2) == c1

    []
