  This file implements a simplified 1D version of numpy's squeeze operation.
  The squeeze function extracts the single element from a sequence of length 1,
  modeling numpy's behavior where squeeze([x]) returns x as a 0D array.

  // Method to squeeze a single-element sequence to extract its value

  method squeeze<T>(a: seq<T>) returns (result: T)
    // Input must be a sequence of exactly size 1
    requires |a| == 1
    
    // The result equals the first (and only) element of the input sequence
    ensures result == a[0]
    
    // Injectivity property: if two size-1 sequences have the same squeezed value, they are equal
    ensures forall b: seq<T> :: |b| == 1 && b[0] == result ==> a == b
    
    // All elements in the sequence equal the result (trivial for size 1, but captures the uniqueness)
    ensures forall i: int :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> a[i] == result
