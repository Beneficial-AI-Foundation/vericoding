  This file implements multiplication of Legendre polynomial series.
  Legendre series are represented as sequences of coefficients, where
  the i-th coefficient corresponds to the coefficient of the i-th Legendre polynomial P_i.

  method LegMul(c1: seq<real>, c2: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Input sequences must be non-empty to represent valid polynomial series
    requires |c1| >= 1
    requires |c2| >= 1
    // Output size follows polynomial multiplication rule: degree sum plus 1
    ensures |result| == |c1| + |c2| - 1
    // For constant polynomials (single coefficient), multiplication is straightforward
    ensures |c1| == 1 && |c2| == 1 ==> |result| == 1 && result[0] == c1[0] * c2[0]
    // The result coefficients are bounded based on input coefficient bounds
    ensures (forall i :: 0 <= i < |c1| ==> -1000.0 <= c1[i] <= 1000.0) &&
            (forall j :: 0 <= j < |c2| ==> -1000.0 <= c2[j] <= 1000.0) ==>
            (forall k :: 0 <= k < |result| ==> -1000000.0 <= result[k] <= 1000000.0)
    // Mathematical property: result represents the product of input series in Legendre basis
    // The result is the unique sequence such that Σ result[k]*P_k(x) = (Σ c1[i]*P_i(x)) * (Σ c2[j]*P_j(x))
