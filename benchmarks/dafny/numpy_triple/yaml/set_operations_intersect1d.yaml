  This file implements numpy.intersect1d functionality for finding the intersection of two arrays.
  Returns the sorted, unique values that are in both input arrays.

vc-spec: |-
  method intersect1d(ar1: seq<int>, ar2: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    ensures // Result contains only values that exist in both input arrays
      forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] in ar1 && result[i] in ar2
    ensures // Result is sorted in strict ascending order (which ensures uniqueness)
      forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |result| ==> result[i] < result[j]
    ensures // Result is complete - contains all values that appear in both arrays
      forall val :: val in ar1 && val in ar2 ==> val in result
