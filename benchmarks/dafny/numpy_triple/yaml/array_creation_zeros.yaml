vc-description: |-
  Implementation of numpy.zeros functionality - creates a new array/sequence
  of given size filled with zeros, serving as the additive identity for
  vector operations.
vc-preamble: |-
  // Method to create a sequence of zeros of given length
vc-helpers: |-
  
vc-spec: |-
  method zeros<T>(n: nat, zero: T) returns (result: seq<T>)
      ensures |result| == n
      // All elements are zero
      ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == zero
