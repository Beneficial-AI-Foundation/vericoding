  Implementation of numpy.array_equal functionality in Dafny.
  Compares two arrays (represented as sequences) element-wise and returns
  a single boolean indicating whether they are completely equal.
vc-preamble: |-
  // Method that checks if two sequences of the same length are element-wise equal

  method ArrayEqual<T(==)>(a1: seq<T>, a2: seq<T>) returns (result: bool)
    // Precondition: arrays must have the same length (shape constraint)
    requires |a1| == |a2|
    
    // Main postcondition: result is true iff all corresponding elements are equal
    ensures result <==> (forall i :: 0 <= i < |a1| ==> a1[i] == a2[i])
    
    // Special case: empty arrays are equal (vacuous truth)
    ensures |a1| == 0 ==> result == true
    
    // Special case: if any element differs, result is false
    ensures (exists i :: 0 <= i < |a1| && a1[i] != a2[i]) ==> result == false
    
    // Reflexivity property: any array is equal to itself
    ensures a1 == a2 ==> result == true
