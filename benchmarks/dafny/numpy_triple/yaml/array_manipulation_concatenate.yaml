vc-description: |-
  Dafny specification for numpy.concatenate functionality.
  Defines the behavior of joining sequences of arrays along an existing axis.
  This implementation focuses on 1D array concatenation, joining two vectors
  end-to-end to produce a single vector containing all elements in order.

vc-spec: |-
  method Concatenate(a: seq<real>, b: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Postcondition: result has length equal to sum of input lengths
    ensures |result| == |a| + |b|
    
    // Postcondition: first |a| elements of result match vector a
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> result[i] == a[i]
    
    // Postcondition: next |b| elements of result match vector b  
    ensures forall j :: 0 <= j < |b| ==> result[|a| + j] == b[j]
