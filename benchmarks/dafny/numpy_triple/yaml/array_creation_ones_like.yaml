vc-description: |-
  Return a sequence of ones with the same length as the input sequence.
  This is equivalent to numpy.ones_like which creates a new sequence
  filled with ones, having the same size as the input sequence.

  method OnesLike<T>(a: seq<T>, one: T) returns (result: seq<T>)
    // Postcondition: result has same length as input
    ensures |result| == |a|
    // Postcondition: every element in result is the "one" value
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == one
