vc-description: |-
  Legendre polynomial series addition functionality.
  Performs component-wise addition of two Legendre series represented as coefficient arrays.
  Each series is represented as a sequence of coefficients ordered from lowest to highest degree.

vc-spec: |-
  method LegendreAdd(c1: seq<real>, c2: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
      // The result has length equal to the maximum of the input lengths
      ensures |result| == if |c1| >= |c2| then |c1| else |c2|
      // Each coefficient in the result is the sum of corresponding coefficients from inputs
      // Missing coefficients are treated as zero
      ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> 
          result[i] == (if i < |c1| then c1[i] else 0.0) + (if i < |c2| then c2[i] else 0.0)
