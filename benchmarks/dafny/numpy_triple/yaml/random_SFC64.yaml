  SFC64 pseudo-random number generator with 256-bit state.
  Implements the SFC64 BitGenerator that uses a 256-bit state split into four 64-bit words.
  SFC64 is a chaotic RNG that is very fast and appears to be very robust to statistical tests.
vc-preamble: |-
  // SFC64 state containing 256 bits split into four 64-bit words
  datatype SFC64State = SFC64State(a: bv64, b: bv64, c: bv64, counter: bv64)
  
  // Option type for optional seed parameter
  datatype Option<T> = None | Some(value: T)
  
  // SFC64 initialization method that creates a 256-bit state from an optional seed

vc-spec: |-
  method SFC64(seed: Option<bv64>) returns (state: SFC64State)
    // If no seed provided, initialize state to all zeros
    ensures seed.None? ==> state.a == 0 && state.b == 0 && state.c == 0 && state.counter == 0
    // If seed provided, at least one component should be non-zero (proper initialization)
    ensures seed.Some? ==> (state.a != 0 || state.b != 0 || state.c != 0 || state.counter != 0)
