  Universal function call implementation for binary operations on vectors.
  This file defines the specification for applying binary operations elementwise
  to input vectors, representing the core __call__ behavior for binary ufuncs
  like add, multiply, etc.
vc-preamble: |-
  // Type alias for binary operations on real numbers
  type BinaryOp = (real, real) -> real
  
  // Method representing ufunc.__call__ for binary operations on vectors
vc-helpers: |-
  
vc-spec: |-
  method UfuncCall(op: BinaryOp, a: seq<real>, b: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Input vectors must have the same length
    requires |a| == |b|
    // Result has the same length as input vectors
    ensures |result| == |a|
    // Each element in the result is computed by applying the operation
    // to corresponding elements from the input vectors
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == op(a[i], b[i])
