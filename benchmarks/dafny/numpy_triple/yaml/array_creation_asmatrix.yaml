  Implementation of numpy.asmatrix - interpret input as matrix without copying.
  This represents a 1D vector as a matrix type, acting as an identity operation
  with matrix type semantics while preserving all original data and structure.

vc-spec: |-
  method asmatrix(data: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Postcondition: length is preserved
    ensures |result| == |data|
    // Postcondition: all elements are preserved in same order
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |data| ==> result[i] == data[i]
