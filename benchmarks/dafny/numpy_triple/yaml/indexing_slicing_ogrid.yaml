vc-description: |-
  Open multi-dimensional "meshgrid" - simplified 1D version.
  
  Returns a sequence of evenly spaced values similar to arange but with
  the ogrid interface. For the 1D case, it returns a single sequence with
  evenly spaced values from start towards stop with the given step size.
  Forms an arithmetic sequence where each element i satisfies result[i] = start + i * step.

  method ogrid(start: real, stop: real, step: real, n: nat) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Precondition: step must be non-zero
    requires step != 0.0
    
    // Precondition: n must equal the number of steps from start to stop
    requires n == (if step > 0.0 then (stop - start) / step else (start - stop) / (-step)) as int
    
    // Postcondition: result has exactly n elements
    ensures |result| == n
    
    // Postcondition: each element forms an arithmetic sequence
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> result[i] == start + (i as real) * step
    
    // Postcondition: all elements are within the appropriate range based on step direction
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> 
      if step > 0.0 then start <= result[i] < stop
      else stop < result[i] <= start
