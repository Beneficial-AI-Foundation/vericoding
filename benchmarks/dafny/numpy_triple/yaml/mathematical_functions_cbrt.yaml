  This file implements the specification for numpy.cbrt functionality,
  which computes the cube root of each element in an array element-wise.
  The cube root function is defined for all real numbers, including negative numbers.

vc-spec: |-
  method cbrt(x: array<real>) returns (result: array<real>)
    // Postconditions: result array properties
    ensures result.Length == x.Length
    // Core specification: each result element is the cube root of corresponding input element
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < result.Length ==> 
      result[i] * result[i] * result[i] == x[i]
