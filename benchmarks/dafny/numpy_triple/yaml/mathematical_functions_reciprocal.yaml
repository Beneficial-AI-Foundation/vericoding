  numpy.reciprocal: Return the reciprocal of the argument, element-wise.
  
  This file specifies the mathematical behavior of computing 1/x for each element
  in an input sequence, ensuring proper handling of non-zero requirements and
  preserving mathematical properties like sign preservation.

  method numpy_reciprocal(x: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Precondition: All elements in x must be non-zero to avoid division by zero
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |x| ==> x[i] != 0.0
    // Postcondition: Result has same length as input
    ensures |result| == |x|
    // Postcondition: Each result element is the reciprocal of corresponding input element
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |x| ==> result[i] == 1.0 / x[i]
    // Postcondition: All result elements are non-zero (since input elements are non-zero)
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |x| ==> result[i] != 0.0
    // Postcondition: Sign preservation - positive inputs yield positive outputs
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |x| ==> (x[i] > 0.0 ==> result[i] > 0.0)
    // Postcondition: Sign preservation - negative inputs yield negative outputs
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |x| ==> (x[i] < 0.0 ==> result[i] < 0.0)
