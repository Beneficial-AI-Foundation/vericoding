  This file implements the specification for numpy.fromiter functionality,
  which creates a new 1-dimensional array from an iterable object by taking
  the first count elements from the iterable sequence.

  // Method to create a new sequence containing the first count elements from an iterable sequence

  method FromIter<T>(iterable: seq<T>, count: nat) returns (result: seq<T>)
      // Precondition: we can't read more elements than available in the iterable
      requires count <= |iterable|
      // Postcondition: result has exactly count elements
      ensures |result| == count
      // Postcondition: each element in result corresponds to the element at the same index in iterable
      ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < count ==> result[i] == iterable[i]
