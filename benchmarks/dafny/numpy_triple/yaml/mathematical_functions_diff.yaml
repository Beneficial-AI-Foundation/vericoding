  Dafny specification for numpy.diff: Calculate the discrete difference along a sequence.
  Computes the difference between consecutive elements, producing a sequence with one less element.
  This is useful for numerical analyses where understanding incremental changes within data is crucial.

  method numpy_diff(a: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
      // Input sequence must be non-empty
      requires |a| >= 1
      // Result has one less element than input
      ensures |result| == |a| - 1
      // Each result element is the difference between consecutive input elements
      ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == a[i+1] - a[i]
      // Type preservation: result maintains the same numeric type as input (real)
