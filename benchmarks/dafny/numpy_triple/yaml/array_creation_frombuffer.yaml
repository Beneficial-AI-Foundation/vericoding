vc-description: |-
  Interpret a buffer as a 1-dimensional array.
  Takes a buffer (represented as a sequence of bytes), the count of elements to read,
  and an offset (starting position in bytes) to create a sequence of the specified type.
  This models numpy.frombuffer which interprets raw bytes as typed array elements.

  method frombuffer(buffer: seq<bv8>, count: nat, offset: nat) returns (result: seq<bv8>)
      // Buffer must have sufficient bytes for the requested elements
      requires offset + count <= |buffer|
      // Offset must be within buffer bounds when count > 0
      requires offset < |buffer| || count == 0
      // Result has exactly 'count' elements
      ensures |result| == count
      // Elements are read sequentially from the buffer starting at offset
      // Each output element corresponds to exactly one input buffer byte
      ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < count ==> result[i] == buffer[offset + i]
