  String inequality comparison for arrays - implements numpy.strings.not_equal
  Performs element-wise string inequality comparison between two sequences of strings.
  Returns a boolean sequence indicating whether corresponding strings are not equal.

  method NotEqual(x1: seq<string>, x2: seq<string>) returns (result: seq<bool>)
    // Input sequences must have the same length for element-wise comparison
    requires |x1| == |x2|
    
    // Output sequence has the same length as input sequences
    ensures |result| == |x1|
    
    // Each element of result is the inequality comparison of corresponding input elements
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |x1| ==> result[i] == (x1[i] != x2[i])
