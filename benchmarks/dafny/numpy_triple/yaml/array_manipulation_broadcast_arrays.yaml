  This file implements broadcasting of arrays following NumPy broadcasting rules.
  For 1D arrays, broadcasting occurs when one array has size 1, and the result
  arrays have the size of the larger input array with appropriate element replication.

  method BroadcastArrays(a: seq<real>, b: seq<real>) returns (a_broadcast: seq<real>, b_broadcast: seq<real>)

    requires |a| == 1 || |b| == 1 || |a| == |b|
