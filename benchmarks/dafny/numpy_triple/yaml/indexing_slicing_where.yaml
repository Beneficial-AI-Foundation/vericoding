  Implementation of numpy.where functionality for selecting elements from two sequences
  based on a boolean condition sequence. Returns elements chosen from x or y depending
  on the corresponding condition value.

  method Where(condition: seq<bool>, x: seq<Float>, y: seq<Float>) returns (result: seq<Float>)
      // All input sequences must have the same length
      requires |condition| == |x| == |y|
      
      // The result sequence has the same length as the input sequences
      ensures |result| == |condition|
      
      // For each position i, result[i] is chosen from x[i] if condition[i] is true, 
      // otherwise from y[i]
      ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |condition| ==> 
          result[i] == if condition[i] then x[i] else y[i]
