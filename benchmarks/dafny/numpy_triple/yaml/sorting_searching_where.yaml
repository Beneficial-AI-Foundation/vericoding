  Implementation of numpy.where functionality - returns elements chosen from x or y
  depending on a boolean condition array. This is a conditional element selection
  operation that operates element-wise on arrays of equal length.

  method NumpyWhere(condition: seq<bool>, x: seq<real>, y: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // All input sequences must have the same length
    requires |condition| == |x| == |y|
    
    // The result sequence has the same length as the input sequences
    ensures |result| == |condition|
    
    // For each index i, if condition[i] is true, result[i] equals x[i], 
    // otherwise result[i] equals y[i]
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> 
      if condition[i] then result[i] == x[i] else result[i] == y[i]
