  This file implements numpy.resize functionality, which returns a new array with the specified shape.
  When the new array is larger than the original, elements are repeated cyclically.
  When smaller, only the first elements are taken.

  method resize<T>(a: seq<T>, new_size: nat) returns (result: seq<T>)
    // The result must have exactly the requested size
    ensures |result| == new_size
    
    // Each element in the result is determined by the resize logic
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < new_size ==>
      if i < |a| then
        // If index is within original bounds, use original element
        result[i] == a[i]
      else if |a| > 0 then
        // If original is non-empty and we need to repeat, use cyclic indexing
        result[i] == a[i % |a|]
