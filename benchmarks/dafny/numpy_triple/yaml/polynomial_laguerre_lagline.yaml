vc-description: |-
  Laguerre series whose graph is a straight line.
  This module provides functionality to create a Laguerre series representation
  of a straight line of the form off + scl*x, where the result is a coefficient
  vector that represents the line in Laguerre polynomial basis.

vc-spec: |-
  method lagline(off: real, scl: real) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // The result is always a sequence of exactly 2 coefficients
    ensures |result| == 2
    // When scl is zero, we have a constant function off, represented as [off, 0]
    ensures scl == 0.0 ==> result[0] == off && result[1] == 0.0
    // When scl is non-zero, the Laguerre representation requires specific coefficients
    ensures scl != 0.0 ==> result[0] == off + scl && result[1] == -scl
