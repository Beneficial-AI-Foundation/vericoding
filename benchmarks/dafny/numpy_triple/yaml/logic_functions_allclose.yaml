vc-description: |-
  Implementation of numpy.allclose functionality that returns True if two arrays
  are element-wise equal within a tolerance. The tolerance values are positive,
  typically very small numbers. The relative difference (rtol * abs(b)) and the
  absolute difference atol are added together to compare against the absolute
  difference between a and b.

  method allclose(a: seq<real>, b: seq<real>, rtol: real, atol: real) returns (result: bool)
      // Preconditions: tolerance values must be non-negative and sequences must have same length
      requires rtol >= 0.0
      requires atol >= 0.0
      requires |a| == |b|
      
      // Postcondition: result is true iff all elements satisfy the tolerance condition
      // For each element i: abs(a[i] - b[i]) <= atol + rtol * abs(b[i])
      ensures result == (forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> 
          Abs(a[i] - b[i]) <= atol + rtol * Abs(b[i]))
