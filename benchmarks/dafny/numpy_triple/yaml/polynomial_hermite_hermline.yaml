vc-description: |-
  Hermite series implementation for linear functions.
  This module provides functionality to create Hermite series coefficients
  for linear functions of the form off + scl*x, where the coefficients
  are derived from physicist's Hermite polynomials.
vc-preamble: |-
  // Method to compute Hermite series coefficients for a linear function
  // Takes an offset (constant term) and scale (linear coefficient)
  // Returns a 2-element sequence representing the Hermite coefficients
vc-helpers: |-
  
vc-spec: |-
  method hermline(off: real, scl: real) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // Output is exactly 2 elements
    ensures |result| == 2
    // First coefficient is the constant term (offset)
    ensures result[0] == off
    // Second coefficient is half the scale factor (due to H‚ÇÅ(x) = 2x relationship)
    ensures result[1] == scl / 2.0
