vc-description: |-
  Natural logarithm function for arrays, element-wise.
  
  The natural logarithm log is the inverse of the exponential function,
  so that log(exp(x)) = x. The natural logarithm is logarithm base e.
  
  Returns an array of the same length containing the natural logarithm
  of each element in the input array.
  
  Note: The domain of the natural logarithm is the positive real numbers.
  Mathematically, log(x) is undefined for x â‰¤ 0.

  method log(x: array<real>) returns (result: array<real>)
    // Precondition: All elements must be positive
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < x.Length ==> x[i] > 0.0
    
    // Postcondition: Result has same length and each element is log of corresponding input element
    ensures result.Length == x.Length
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < result.Length ==> result[i] == Log(x[i])
