vc-description: |-
  numpy.c_: Translates slice objects to concatenation along the second axis.
  
  This function takes two vectors and stacks them as columns to create a 2-D array.
  Each input vector becomes a column in the resulting matrix.
  This is equivalent to column_stack([arr1, arr2]) for 1-D arrays.

  method c_(arr1: seq<real>, arr2: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<seq<real>>)
    // Precondition: input arrays must have the same length
    requires |arr1| == |arr2|
    
    // Postconditions: result structure and content
    ensures |result| == |arr1|  // result has same number of rows as input length
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> |result[i]| == 2  // each row has exactly 2 columns
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> 
      result[i][0] == arr1[i] && result[i][1] == arr2[i]  // correct column placement
