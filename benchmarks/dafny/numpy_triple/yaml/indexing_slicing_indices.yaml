  This file implements numpy.indices functionality for generating grid indices.
  Returns an array representing the indices of a 1D grid where the single row
  contains the sequence [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1].

  // Generate indices for a 1D grid of given size
  // Returns a 2D array where the first dimension has size 1 and contains
  // the indices [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]

  method indices(n: nat) returns (grid: seq<seq<nat>>)
      // The output has exactly one row
      ensures |grid| == 1
      // The single row has exactly n elements
      ensures |grid[0]| == n
      // Each position i contains the value i
      ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> grid[0][i] == i
      // The indices are in ascending order
      ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < n ==> grid[0][i] < grid[0][j]
