vc-description: |-
  Dafny specification for numpy.append functionality.
  Appends values to the end of an array, creating a new array containing
  all elements from arr followed by all elements from values.
vc-preamble: |-
  // Looking at the issues described, they appear to be about type system differences between Lean and Dafny, but the current Dafny specification is actually correct for Dafny. The use of `seq<real>` is appropriate for Dafny's type system, and the postconditions correctly specify the append behavior.
  //
  // Here is the corrected Dafny program (no changes needed as the original specification is correct):
  
  
  
  // Method that appends two sequences of real numbers

  method numpy_append(arr: seq<real>, values: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
    // No preconditions required
    // Postcondition: result length equals sum of input lengths
    ensures |result| == |arr| + |values|
    // Postcondition: first |arr| elements come from arr in order
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |arr| ==> result[i] == arr[i]
    // Postcondition: next |values| elements come from values in order
    ensures forall j :: 0 <= j < |values| ==> result[|arr| + j] == values[j]
