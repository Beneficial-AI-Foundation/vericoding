  This file implements numpy.diagflat functionality: creating a two-dimensional array
  with the flattened input as a diagonal. Takes an input vector and creates a square
  matrix where the input values appear along the main diagonal, with all other elements
  as zero. Returns a 1D flattened representation of the square matrix.

  method diagflat(v: seq<real>) returns (result: seq<real>)
      requires |v| >= 0
      ensures |result| == |v| * |v|
      // Elements on the main diagonal are from the input vector
      ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |v| ==> result[i * |v| + i] == v[i]
      // All other elements are zero  
      ensures forall i, j {:trigger result[i * |v| + j]} :: 0 <= i < |v| && 0 <= j < |v| && i != j ==> result[i * |v| + j] == 0.0
