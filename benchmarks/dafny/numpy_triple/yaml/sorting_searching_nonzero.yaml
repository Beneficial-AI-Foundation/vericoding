  numpy.nonzero: Return the indices of the elements that are non-zero.
  Returns a sequence of indices where the corresponding elements in the input
  array are non-zero, in ascending order with no duplicates.

  method nonzero(a: seq<real>) returns (indices: seq<nat>)
    // No preconditions - accepts any sequence
    requires true
    // Every returned index must be valid and correspond to a non-zero element
    ensures forall i :: i in indices ==> i < |a| && a[i] != 0.0
    // Every non-zero element must have its index in the result (completeness)
    ensures forall j :: 0 <= j < |a| && a[j] != 0.0 ==> j in indices
    // The indices are returned in ascending order
    ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |indices| ==> indices[i] < indices[j]
    // No duplicates in the result (implied by ascending order, but made explicit)
    ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < |indices| && 0 <= j < |indices| && i != j ==> indices[i] != indices[j]
