  This file implements the outer product operation for two vectors.
  Given two vectors a of size m and b of size n, it produces an m√ón matrix
  where element (i,j) equals a[i] * b[j].

  // Method to compute the outer product of two vectors
  // Given vectors a and b, produces a matrix where result[i][j] = a[i] * b[j]
