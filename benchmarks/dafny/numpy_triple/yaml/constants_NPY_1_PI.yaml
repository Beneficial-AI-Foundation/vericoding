  method NPY_1_PI() returns (result: real)
    // 1/π is approximately 0.31831...
    ensures 0.31830 < result < 0.31832
    // Basic sanity check: 1/π is between 0 and 1
    ensures 0.0 < result < 1.0
    // More precise bounds for 1/π
    ensures 0.318309 < result < 0.318310
    // 2/π is approximately 0.6366... (double of 1/π)
    ensures 0.6366 < 2.0 * result < 0.6367
    // (1/π)² is approximately 0.10132...
    ensures 0.10131 < result * result < 0.10133
    // 1/(2π) is approximately 0.15915... (half of 1/π)
    ensures 0.15915 < result / 2.0 < 0.15916
    // Mathematical relationship: result * π ≈ 1 (within floating point precision)
    // Using π approximation 3.141592653589793
    ensures 0.99999 < result * 3.141592653589793 < 1.00001
