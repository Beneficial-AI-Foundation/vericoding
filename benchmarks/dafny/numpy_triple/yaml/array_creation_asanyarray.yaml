  Dafny specification for numpy.asanyarray functionality.
  Converts input to an ndarray, but passes ndarray subclasses through unchanged.
  Models the identity behavior when input is already an ndarray.
vc-preamble: |-
  // Vector type representing a sequence of floating-point numbers
  // Note: Unlike Lean's Vector Float n, Dafny sequences are variable-size
  type Vector = seq<real>
  
  /**
   * AsAnyArray method that returns the input vector unchanged when it's already an ndarray.
   * This captures the key property of numpy.asanyarray: when given an ndarray,
   * it returns the same array without copying.

    ensures |result| == |a|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> result[i] == a[i]
