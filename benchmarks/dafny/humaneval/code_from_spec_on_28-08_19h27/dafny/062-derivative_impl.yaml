  function_signature: def derivative(xs: List Int) -> List Int
  xs represent coefficients of a polynomial. xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + .... Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.

vc-spec: |-
  method derivative(xs: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    ensures |result| == (if |xs| <= 1 then 0 else |xs| - 1)
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == xs[i + 1] * (i + 1)

vc-code: |-
  {
    if |xs| <= 1 {
      result := [];
    } else {
      result := seq(|xs| - 1, i requires 0 <= i < |xs| - 1 => xs[i + 1] * (i + 1));
    }
