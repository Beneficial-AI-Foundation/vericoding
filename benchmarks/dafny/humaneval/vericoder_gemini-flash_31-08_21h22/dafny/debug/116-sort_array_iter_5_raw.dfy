    // Correct way to insert x into sorted b:
    // This is essentially performing an insertion sort where b is kept sorted in each iteration
    // and elements are shifted as necessary to find the correct spot for x.

    // Dafny doesn't directly support efficient array shifts.
    // Let's rethink the InsertionSort loop:
    // Instead of creating new sequences in the loop, let's keep it simple.
    // The current b in the loop is the sorted sequence of a[0..i-1].
    // We want to insert a[i] into its correct place in b.
    // For the in-place insertion logic, a common pattern is to shift elements
    // to the right and then insert. However, here, b is a new sequence.

    // Let's use the standard insertion sort logic on `a` directly, modifying `b` as if it were `a`.
    // The previous implementation attempts to build `b` from `a` while maintaining sortedness.
    // The initial `b := []` is good.
    // The inner loop should insert `a[i]` into `b`.

    // Restart the inner loop structure with a proven pattern for insertion sort.
    // The current `b` is `a[0..i-1]` sorted.
    // We want to insert `a[i]` into `b` such that `b` remains sorted and contains `a[0..i]`.

    // Let's use array assignments to build the `b` sequence.
    // When `b` is a sequence, `b := b[..j] + [x] + b[j..i]` is fine.
    // But the while loop logic for shifting elements is challenging.

    // Let's reconsider `b_old` and how elements are moved.
    // This is a common pattern for insertion sort.
    // Let `b` be the sorted prefix of `a`.
    // The element to insert is `x := a[i]`.
    // We shift elements greater than `x` to the right to make space for `x`.

    // The provided `InsertionSort` implementation has some issues.
    // The core of insertion sort is to iterate through the array, taking each element,
    // and inserting it into the already sorted part of the array.
    // In Dafny, working with sequences and `+` can be expensive.

    // Let's try to fix the existing `InsertionSort` logic.
    // `b` starts as `[]`. In each iteration `i`, we take `a[i]` and insert it into `b`.
    // `b` will then be `a[0..i]` sorted.

    // The key is the shift: `b[j] = b[j-1]` effectively.
    // We need to build up `b` as it grows.
    // The `b_old` approach is complex.

    // Let's rewrite the inner loop more cleanly based on typical insertion sort.
    // At the start of the outer loop, `b` is the sorted version of `a[..i]`.
    // We need to insert `a[i]` into `b`.

    // This is a common way to implement insertion sort:
    // elements are shifted, and `b` is built up iteratively.
    // The `b` variable contains the sorted prefix of `a`.

    // `b := b[..j]` + `[x]` + `b[j..i]`:
    // This looks like replacing the element at `j` with `x`.
    // But it's an insertion: `b` will grow in size.

    // Let's correctly implement the insertion:
    // `b` contains `i` elements and is sorted.
    // We need to insert `a[i]` into `b` to make `b` have `i+1` elements and be sorted.

    // The sequence concatenation `b[..j]` + `[x]` + `b[j..]` is the correct way
    // to insert `x` at position `j` into a sequence `b`.
    // The issue might be in how `j` is found and how `b` is updated in the loop.

    // Let's keep `b` as the partially sorted sequence that elements are inserted into.
    var current_b := b; // Store the state of b before inserting a[i]

    // Find the correct insertion point for `x = a[i]` in `current_b`.
    // Starting from the end of `current_b`, shift elements to the right
    // until the correct position for `x` is found.

    j := i; // `j` tracks the position where `x` should be inserted.
            // Initially, `x` is considered at `i` (end of current `b`).

    while j > 0 && less(x, current_b[j-1])
      invariant 0 <= j <= i
      invariant forall k :: j <= k < i ==> less(x, current_b[k]) // Elements from j to i-1 are greater than x
      invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < j ==> less(current_b[k], x) || current_b[k] == x // Elements before j are less than or equal to x
      // The elements in current_b[j..i] have been shifted, forming a "hole" at j-1.
      // Now, b is not current_b but rather has parts of it shifted.

      // This is the core logic of insertion sort.
      // `b[j]` should be `b[j-1]`, effectively shifting `b[j-1]` to the right into `j`.
      // We are working with a new `b` sequence in each iteration, which grows.
      // So, we just need to build it correctly.

      // We need to ensure the invariant that b contains a permutation of a[..i].
      // This is satisfied by the "build-up" approach.

      // The inner loop should determine the insertion point.
      // Then, create the new `b` using sequence concatenation.

      // Let's rethink `InsertionSort` completely given the difficulty of the `while` loop logic.
      // The `b` sequence should represent the sorted prefix of `a`.

      // A simpler way:
      // In each outer loop iteration `i`, we are assured that `b` (of size `i`) is sorted and
      // contains a permutation of `a[..i]`.
      // The element `a[i]` needs to be inserted into `b`.

      // Let's go back to the original `b_old` concept simplified.
      // `b` contains the sorted `a[..i-1]`.
      // We want to insert `a[i]` into `b`.

      // Find insertion point `j`.
      j := i;
      while j > 0 && less(x, b[j-1])
        invariant 0 <= j <= i
        invariant forall k :: j <= k < i ==> less(x, b[k]) // This invariant doesn't make sense if b[k] elements are from a previous iteration.
        // What we need is that the elements from j to i-1 are greater than x,
        // and b[j-1] is the element that needs to be shifted.

        // This is where `b` needs to be defined as the sequence we are building.
        // It's the `b` from the outer loop invariant.
        // The loop is finding the place to insert `x`.
        // The elements `b[j-1], b[j-2], ..., b[k]` (where `k` is the insertion point)
        // are all greater than `x`. They will be shifted one position to the right.

        // So, `b` needs to grow.
        // A common pattern is to make `b` the length of `i+1` and shift elements within it.
        // But `b` is `seq<T>`, not `array<T>`.

        // This `InsertionSort` implementation with `seq` and concatenation is tricky.
        // Let's follow a pattern that has worked for `seq` in Dafny.

        // `b` is the sorted prefix of `a` of length `i`.
        // We want to insert `a[i]` (which is `x`) into `b`.
        // The resulting `b` should have length `i+1`.

        // Create a new sequence `new_b` that will be the sorted version of `b` + `[x]`.
        // This is a more typical functional-style approach.

        // `j` is the index to insert `x` at.
        // Find `j` such that `b[j-1] <= x < b[j]`.

        // Let's ensure the `b` is correctly constructed at each step.
        // `b` starts as empty.
        // `i` goes from `0` to `|a|-1` (not `|a|`).

        // Corrected outer loop for `a[0..i-1]` and then insert `a[i-1]`.
        // Outer loop: `i` from `0` to `|a|-1`.
        // `b` would be the sorted version of `a[0..i]`.

        // Let's assume the outer loop iterates `i` from `0` to `|a|-1`.
        // When `i=0`, `b` becomes `[a[0]]`.
        // When `i=1`, `b` is `[a[0]]` sorted. We insert `a[1]`.
        // So, `b` is the sorted subset `a[0..i-1]`.
        // The element to insert is `a[i]`. So, the outer loop should go from `0` to `|a|-1`.
