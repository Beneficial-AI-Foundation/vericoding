  // This lemma needs to be more specific. rot2 is defined as +2.
  // We need to show that for each individual vowel, rot2 results in a vowel.
  // Alternatively, the postcondition of the `rot2` function could be strengthened
  // to ensure its result is a vowel. For now, let's assume the existing `is_vowel`
  // and `rot2` implies this.
  // The provided `rot2` function just adds 2 to the char's integer value.
  // For 'a', rot2('a') = 'c', which is not a vowel according to `is_vowel`.
  // The current definition of `rot2` and `is_vowel` would cause issues with verification.
  // If the intent is for `rot2` to cyclically rotate among vowels or something similar,
  // the `rot2` definition would need to be changed.
  // Given the specification, `rot2` simply adds 2.
  // If the character becomes non-vowel after rot2 (e.g. 'a' -> 'c'), then the post-condition `is_vowel(t[i])` for
  // `t[i] == rot2(swap_case(s[i]))` would fail.
  // The problem statement implies `rot2` should give another vowel if input is vowel.
  // The original definition of rot2 needs to be corrected to ensure it produces a vowel from a vowel.
  // Assuming the problem setter *intended* rot2 to keep it a vowel, or that the test cases
  // for the specific vowels will pass 'a'+2='c', 'e'+2='g', etc., which are not vowels.
  // This seems like a contradiction in the problem statement's `rot2` vs `is_vowel` vs `ensures`.

  // Let's assume for now that if rot2 applies to a vowel, the result should satisfy the contract.
  // Given the current rot2 definition, this lemma is hard to prove without changing rot2.
  // For the sake of verification, we will assume rot2 makes sense with the overall logic,
  // potentially by only being called for specific vowels for which the output *is* a vowel,
  // or that the problem implies some more complex mapping.
  // The name `rot2` implies rotation, but the implementation is simple addition.
  // If it's literally `char as int + 2`, then 'a' becomes 'c', 'e' becomes 'g'.
  // This violates `is_vowel(t[i])` if `t[i] == rot2(swap_case(s[i]))` and `is_vowel(s[i])`.
  // The `is_vowel` postcondition of `ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| && is_vowel(s[i]) ==> t[i] == rot2(swap_case(s[i]))`
  // also doesn't say anything about the outcome being a vowel.

  // The crucial part is that the postcondition for `encode` method says:
  // `ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| && is_vowel(s[i]) ==> t[i] == rot2(swap_case(s[i]))`
  // This implies we simply need to apply `rot2` and `swap_case` as specified,
  // not that `rot2` results in a vowel. The `is_vowel(swap_case(c)) == is_vowel(c)` from `swap_case` is important.
  // So, if `s[i]` is a vowel, then `swap_case(s[i])` is also a vowel.
  // Then `rot2` is applied to that swapped vowel. The postcondition of `rot2` has no constraint on the result being a vowel.
  // So the lemma `Rot2VowelRange` is actually not required by the specifications.
