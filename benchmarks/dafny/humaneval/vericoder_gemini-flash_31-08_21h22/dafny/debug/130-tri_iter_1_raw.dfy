                         // For odd `n`, it calls `tri(n+1)`. `n+1` is even. The decreases value becomes `0`.
                         // This doesn't help show termination if then `tri(n+1)` itself recurses.
                         //
                         // However, the task is to implement `Tribonacci(n)` using the *given* `tri` function as the specification.
                         // This means we need to *compute* `tri(i)` for `0 <= i <= n`.

                         // **Re-thinking the problem statement:**
                         // The problem provides `function tri(n: nat)` and asks to implement a method `Tribonacci(n)`
                         // such that `result[i] == tri(i)`.
                         //
                         // The default `tri` function *as written* is non-terminating or hard to reason about due to `tri(n+1)`.
                         // It's possible the `tri` function implicitly assumes an external context or that it's just a definition,

                         //

                         // My interpretation must be that the *intent* of the problem is to use a standard Tribonacci sequence,
                         // or that the provided `tri` function is meant to be interpreted in a way that *it is terminating and functional*.
                         //
                         // If I use the *literal* `tri` function, `tri(odd)` calls `tri(even)` and `tri(even)` terminates.
                         // So, `tri(odd)` calls `tri(even)`, and then the other two terms `tri(n-1)` and `tri(n-2)` eventually
                         // resolve to base cases or even numbers.
                         //
                         // Let's analyze `tri(n)` again assuming it's meant to be evaluable:
                         // tri(0): not defined by its cases. Needs a base case.
                         // tri(1) = 3
                         // tri(2) = 1 + 2/2 = 2
                         // tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4) = 2 + 3 + (1 + 4/2) = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8
                         // tri(4) = 1 + 4/2 = 3
                         // tri(5) = tri(4) + tri(3) + tri(6) = 3 + 8 + (1 + 6/2) = 3 + 8 + 4 = 15
                         //
                         // This function IS well-founded, even with `tri(n+1)`, because `n+1` is even, and `tri(even)`
                         // is a direct computation. The `decreases` clause `decreases if n % 2 == 0 then 0 else n` works
                         // because if `n` is odd, `n-1` and `n-2` are smaller. `n+1` makes it tricky for a simple
                         // lexicographical order.
                         //
                         // However, Dafny's default termination checker might struggle if not guided.
                         // `decreases if n % 2 == 0 then 0 else n`
                         // When `n` is odd, we compare `n` to `n-1`, `n-2`, `n+1`.
                         // `n-1 < n` and `n-2 < n`.
                         // `n+1 > n`. However, the *value* of the decreases measure for `n+1` will be `0` (since `n+1` is even).
                         // The original `n` had measure `n`. The recursive calls are `(n-1)`, `(n-2)`, and `(n+1)` which has measure `0`.
                         // This *is* a valid termination argument because for odd `n`, the recursive calls have measures `n-1`, `n-2`, and `0`.
                         // All of these are strictly less than `n`.
                         // So, the provided `tri` function *is* well-founded and computable in Dafny.
                         //
                         // My apologies for the earlier misinterpretation. The crucial part is that `tri(even)` has `decreases 0`.
                         //
                         // The missing part for `tri(0)`: The problem implies that `tri(n)` applies for `n: nat`. `nat` includes `0`.
                         // The problem statement `forall i :: 0 <= i <= n ==> result[i] == tri(i)` implies that `tri(0)` must be defined.
                         // The provided `tri` function does not define `tri(0)`.
                         // Standard Tribonacci sequence usually starts with T(0)=0, T(1)=1, T(2)=1 or T(0)=0, T(1)=0, T(2)=1, T(3)=1 etc.
                         // But `tri(1)=3` is given.
                         // If `n=0`, `n==1` is false, `n%2==0` is true, so `tri(0) = 1+0/2 = 1`.
                         // Let's test this:
                         // tri(0) = 1
                         // tri(1) = 3
                         // tri(2) = 1+2/2 = 2

                         // tri(4) = 1+4/2 = 3
                         //
                         // Given these values, we just need to compute them iteratively.
