  function_signature: def make_a_pile(n: int) -> List[int]
  Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones. The first level has n stones. The number of stones in the next level is: Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

  method make_a_pile(n: int) returns (pile: seq<int>)
    // pre-conditions-start
    requires n >= 0
    // pre-conditions-end
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures |pile| == n
    ensures forall i :: 1 <= i < n ==> pile[i] == pile[i - 1] + 2
    ensures n > 0 ==> pile[0] == n
