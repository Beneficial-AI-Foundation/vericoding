  function_signature: def derivative(xs: List Int) -> List Int
  xs represent coefficients of a polynomial. xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + .... Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.

  method derivative(xs: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    // pre-conditions-start
    requires |xs| > 0
    // pre-conditions-end
    // post-conditions-start
    ensures |result| == |xs| - 1
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == xs[i+1] * (i+1)
