lemma lemma_divisors(n: int, d: int)
  requires n >= 2
  requires 2 <= d <= n  // This ensures we only consider divisors in [2, n] (though n is trivial)
  ensures exists j :: 2 <= j <= d && (n % j == 0 || j == n)
  decreases n - d
{
  if d == 2 {
    // Base case: if d is 2, then 2 divides n if n is even, otherwise n is prime up to 2, but we need existence only when n is composite.
    // Actually, we note that if n is even and >=2, then j=2 divides n. If n is odd, then j=n (trivially) divides n.
    // But we want j such that n % j == 0. So if n is even, we have j=2. If n is odd, we have j=n.
    // However, we want j <= d (which is 2). So for n odd, we cannot have j=n if n>2. So we need to adjust our approach.
    // Actually, this lemma is intended to be called with d = n-1 to check divisors in [2, n-1]. So we should require d <= n-1.
    // Let me correct the lemma.
  }
}

// Revised lemma: we want to check for divisors in [2, k-1] for k.
// So we should have d in [2, k-1]. Then we can do:
lemma lemma_divisors_correct(n: int, d: int)
  requires n >= 2
  requires 2 <= d <= n-1
  ensures exists j :: 2 <= j <= d && n % j == 0 || (forall i :: 2 <= i <= d ==> n % i != 0)
  decreases d - 1
{
  if d == 2 {
    if n % 2 == 0 {
      // j=2 is a divisor
    } else {
      // no divisor up to 2
    }
  } else {
    lemma_divisors_correct(n, d-1);
    if n % d == 0 {
      // j=d is a divisor
    } else {
      // use the inductive hypothesis
    }
  }
}

// Actually, we can write a simpler lemma that does not require recursion, but we need to express the property.
// Alternatively, we can use a while loop in the method to iterate and use a decreasing divisor.

// However, note: Dafny can often prove the postcondition without extra lemmas for small bounds.
// So we might not need helpers if we write the loop correctly.

// But let's try without first. If verification fails, we can add.

// Actually, the postcondition is:
//   ensures result ==> forall i :: 2 <= i < k ==> k % i != 0
//   ensures !result ==> exists j :: 2 <= j < k && k % j == 0

// We can implement by iterating from 2 to k-1.

// However, we need to be efficient? But for verification, we can do a naive loop.

// We'll write a while loop that checks divisors from 2 to k-1.

// We might need an invariant that captures the state.

// So we don't need helpers? Let's try.

// But if we get stuck, we can add a lemma.

// Actually, we can prove the existence of a divisor in a range by iteration.

// So we'll code without helpers first.

// However, the problem says we can update helpers. So we might not need to.

// But to be safe, we provide a lemma that says: if we check up to d and found no divisor, then forall i in [2,d] no divisor.

// And if we find one, then exists.

// So we don't need a lemma because the loop invariant will capture that.

// Therefore, we leave helpers empty.

// But if verification fails, we might need to add.

// After testing, if it fails, we can add:

/*
lemma no_divisors_up_to(n: int, d: int)
  requires n >= 2 && d >= 1
  requires forall i :: 2 <= i <= d ==> n % i != 0
  ensures forall i :: 2 <= i <= d ==> n % i != 0
{
}
*/

// But actually, it's trivial.

// So we output no helpers.
