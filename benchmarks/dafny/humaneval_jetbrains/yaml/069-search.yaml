  function_signature: def search(numbers: List[int]) -> int
  You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list. If no such a value exist, return -1.
