  /*
  This problem focuses on reversing an array of integers. The goal is to take an input array and produce a new array with the elements arranged in the reverse order.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  • a: An array of integers, which may be empty, contain one element, or many elements.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is an array of integers that:
  • Has the same length as the input array.
  • Contains the same elements as the input array, but in reverse order.
  • For every valid index i in the input array, the output at index i is equal to the element at index (a.size - 1 - i) from the input array.
  
  -----Note-----
  There are no specific preconditions; the method should correctly handle any array of integers.
