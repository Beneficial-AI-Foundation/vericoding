  /*
  Given an input string "words_str", this task requires writing a Dafny method that reverses the order of its words. A word is defined as a contiguous sequence of non-space characters. The method must remove any extra spaces so that the output string contains words separated by a single space and has no leading or trailing spaces. The characters within each word must stay the same as the original input.
  
  -----Input-----
  words_str: A string that may contain leading, trailing, or multiple spaces between words.
  
  -----Output-----
  A string with the words from the input reversed, where words are separated by a single space, with no extra spaces at the beginning or end.
