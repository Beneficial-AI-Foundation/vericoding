  /*
  This task is about processing an array of integers by producing a new array that excludes the first element. The objective is to define a clear behavior: if the array contains at least one element, return a modified array starting from the second element.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  • a: An array of integers.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is an array of integers that:
  • Has a length equal to the original array's length minus one.
  • Contains the same elements as the input array except for the first element.
  • Satisfies the condition that for every index i in the output array, the element at position i is equal to the element at position i+1 in the input array.
  
  -----Note-----
  It is assumed that the input array is non-empty.
