  /*
  This task requires writing a Dafny method that determines the minimum of two integers. The method should return the smaller of the two numbers. When both numbers are equal, either one may be returned.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of two integers:
  a: The first integer.
  b: The second integer.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is an integer:
  Returns the smaller value between the input integers, ensuring that the result is less than or equal to both inputs.
