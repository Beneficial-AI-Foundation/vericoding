  /*
  This problem involves swapping the values of two integers. Given two integers as inputs, the objective is to return the two numbers in reversed order.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of two integers:
  • X: The first integer.
  • Y: The second integer.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a tuple of two integers (Int × Int) where:
  • The first element is equal to Y.
  • The second element is equal to X.
  
  -----Note-----
  There are no restrictions on the input values. The function must correctly swap the inputs regardless of whether they are positive, negative, or zero.

  method SwapArithmetic(x: int, y: int) returns (result: (int, int))
      ensures result.0 == y
      ensures result.1 == x
      ensures x != y ==> (result.0 != x && result.1 != y)
