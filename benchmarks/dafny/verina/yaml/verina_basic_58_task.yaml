  /*
  This task involves transforming an array of integers by doubling each element.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  â€¢ s: An array of integers.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is an array of integers where for each valid index i, the element at position i is equal to twice the corresponding element in the input array.
  
  -----Note-----
  The implementation makes use of a recursive helper function to update the array in place. It is assumed that the input array is valid and that the doubling operation does not lead to any overflow issues.
