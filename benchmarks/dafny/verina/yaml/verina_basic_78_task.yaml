  /*
  Given two integers, the task is to compute two output values: one being the sum of the integers and the other being their difference.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of two integers:
  • x: An integer.
  • y: An integer.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a tuple of two integers:
  • The first element is x + y.
  • The second element is x - y.
  
  -----Note-----
  It is assumed that x and y are valid integers. There are no additional constraints on the inputs.
