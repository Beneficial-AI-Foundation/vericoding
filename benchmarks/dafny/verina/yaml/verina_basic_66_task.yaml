  /*
  This task focuses on determining if a given integer is even. The problem requires checking whether the integer can be represented as twice another integer, meaning it is divisible by 2 without any remainder.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of a single integer:
  • x: An integer to be evaluated.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a boolean value:
  • true if x is even (x mod 2 equals 0).
  • false if x is odd.
  
  -----Note-----
  No additional preconditions are required. The method should work correctly for any integer value.
