  /*
  This task requires writing a Dafny method that counts the number of digit characters within a given string. A digit is any character between '0' and '9'. The method should determine how many such digit characters appear in the input.
  
  Input:
  The input consists of:
  s: A string.
  
  Output:
  The output is a natural number (nat):
  Returns a non-negative count representing the number of digit characters found in the input string.
  
  Note:
  There are no additional preconditions; the method works for any provided string.
