  /*
  This problem involves updating an array of integers by modifying two specific positions. Specifically, the element at index 4 should be increased by 3, and the element at index 7 should be changed to 516. The goal is to correctly update these positions while leaving the rest of the array unchanged. The description assumes that the array contains at least 8 elements.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  • a: An array of integers. The array must contain at least 8 elements.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is an array of integers that meets the following criteria:
  • The element at index 4 is updated to its original value plus 3.
  • The element at index 7 is set to 516.
  • All other elements in the array remain the same as in the input array.
  
  -----Note-----
  It is assumed that the input array has a size of at least 8 elements. Indices are 0-indexed.
