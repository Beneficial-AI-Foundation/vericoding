  /*
  This task requires writing a Dafny method that calculates how much water can be trapped between elevations after it rains. The input is an array of non-negative integers representing an elevation map. Each index traps water depending on the min of max heights to its left and right.
  
  Input:
  - height: An array of natural numbers representing elevations.
  
  Output:
  - A natural number: total units of water that can be trapped.
