  /*
  This task involves concatenating two arrays of integers by appending the second array to the end of the first array. The goal is to produce a new array that sequentially contains all elements from the first array followed by all elements from the second array.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of two parameters:
  • a: An Array of integers representing the first part of the concatenated array.
  • b: An Array of integers representing the second part of the concatenated array.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is an Array of integers that satisfies the following:
  • The length of the output array is equal to the sum of the lengths of arrays a and b.
  • The first part of the output array (indices 0 to a.size - 1) is identical to array a.
  • The remaining part of the output array (indices a.size to a.size + b.size - 1) is identical to array b.
  
  -----Note-----
  No additional preconditions are required since the function uses the sizes of the input arrays to build the resulting array.
