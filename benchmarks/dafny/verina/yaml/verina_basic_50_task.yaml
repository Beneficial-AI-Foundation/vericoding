  /*
  This task is about calculating the absolute value of an integer. The goal is to determine the non-negative value of a given integer: if the integer is non-negative, it remains unchanged; if it is negative, its positive counterpart is returned.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  • x: An integer.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is an integer that represents the absolute value of the input. Specifically:
  • If x is non-negative, the output is x.
  • If x is negative, the output is the negation of x (that is, a value y such that x + y = 0).
  
  -----Note-----
  This function should correctly handle zero, positive, and negative integers.
