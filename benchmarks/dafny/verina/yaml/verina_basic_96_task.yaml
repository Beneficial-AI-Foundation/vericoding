  /*
  This task requires swapping two integer values. Given two integers as input, the objective is to produce an output where their order is reversed: the first element of the output corresponds to the second input and the second element corresponds to the first input.
  
  Input:
  The input consists of two integers:
  • X: An integer value.
  • Y: Another integer value.
  
  Output:
  The output is a tuple (int, int) where:
  • The first element is equal to Y.
  • The second element is equal to X.
  
  Note:
  There are no additional preconditions for this task. The function simply returns a swapped tuple of its two input integers.
