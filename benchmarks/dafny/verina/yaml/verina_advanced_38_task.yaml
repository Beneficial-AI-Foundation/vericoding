  /*
  This task requires implementing a Dafny method that, given a list of intervals, returns the maximum amount that can be spanned after we removed one of the intervals
  You may assume you'll receive at least one interval
  
  Input: The input consists of a list of ordered pairs of intervals.
  Output: The output is an integer: Return the largest span that is possible after removing one of the intervals.
