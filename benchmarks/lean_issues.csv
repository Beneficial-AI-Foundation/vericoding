Polycarp, Arkady's friend, prepares to the programming competition and decides to write a contest. The contest consists of $n$ problems and lasts for $T$ minutes. Each of the problems is defined by two positive integers $a_i$ and $p_i$ — its difficulty and the score awarded by its solution.

Polycarp's experience suggests that his skill level is defined with positive real value $s$, and initially $s=1.0$. To solve the $i$-th problem Polycarp needs $a_i/s$ minutes.

Polycarp loves to watch series, and before solving each of the problems he will definitely watch one episode. After Polycarp watches an episode, his skill decreases by $10\%$, that is skill level $s$ decreases to $0.9s$. Each episode takes exactly $10$ minutes to watch. When Polycarp decides to solve some problem, he firstly has to watch one episode, and only then he starts solving the problem without breaks for $a_i/s$ minutes, where $s$ is his current skill level. In calculation of $a_i/s$ no rounding is performed, only division of integer value $a_i$ by real value $s$ happens.

Also, Polycarp can train for some time. If he trains for $t$ minutes, he increases his skill by $C \cdot t$, where $C$ is some given positive real constant. Polycarp can train only before solving any problem (and before watching series). Duration of the training can be arbitrary real value.

Polycarp is interested: what is the largest score he can get in the contest? It is allowed to solve problems in any order, while training is only allowed before solving the first problem.

-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $tc$ ($1 \le tc \le 20$) — the number of test cases. Then $tc$ test cases follow.

The first line of each test contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of problems in the contest.

The second line of the test contains two real values $C, T$ ($0 < C < 10$, $0 \le T \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $C$ defines the efficiency of the training and $T$ is the duration of the contest in minutes. Value $C, T$ are given exactly with three digits after the decimal point.

Each of the next $n$ lines of the test contain characteristics of the corresponding problem: two integers $a_i, p_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^4$, $1 \le p_i \le 10$) — the difficulty and the score of the problem.

It is guaranteed that the value of $T$ is such that changing it by the $0.001$ in any direction will not change the test answer.

Please note that in hacks you can only use $tc = 1$.

-----Output-----

Print $tc$ integers — the maximum possible score in each test case.

-----Examples-----

Output

20

-----Note-----

In the first example, Polycarp can get score of $7$ as follows:  Firstly he trains for $4$ minutes, increasing $s$ to the value of $5$;  Then he decides to solve $4$-th problem: he watches one episode in $10$ minutes, his skill level decreases to $s=5*0.9=4.5$ and then he solves the problem in $5/s=5/4.5$, which is roughly $1.111$ minutes;  Finally, he decides to solve $2$-nd problem: he watches one episode in $10$ minutes, his skill level decreases to $s=4.5*0.9=4.05$ and then he solves the problem in $20/s=20/4.05$, which is roughly $4.938$ minutes. 

This way, Polycarp uses roughly $4+10+1.111+10+4.938=30.049$ minutes, to get score of $7$ points. It is not possible to achieve larger score in $31$ minutes.

In the second example, Polycarp can get $20$ points as follows:  Firstly he trains for $4$ minutes, increasing $s$ to the value of $5$;  Then he decides to solve $1$-st problem: he watches one episode in $10$ minutes, his skill decreases to $s=5*0.9=4.5$ and then he solves problem in $1/s=1/4.5$, which is roughly $0.222$ minutes.  Finally, he decides to solve $2$-nd problem: he watches one episode in $10$ minutes, his skill decreases to $s=4.5*0.9=4.05$ and then he solves the problem in $10/s=10/4.05$, which is roughly $2.469$ minutes. 

This way, Polycarp gets score of $20$ in $4+10+0.222+10+2.469=26.691$ minutes. It is not possible to achieve larger score in $30$ minutes.

It is lunch time for Mole. His friend, Marmot, prepared him a nice game for lunch.

Marmot brought Mole n ordered piles of worms such that i-th pile contains a_{i} worms. He labeled all these worms with consecutive integers: worms in first pile are labeled with numbers 1 to a_1, worms in second pile are labeled with numbers a_1 + 1 to a_1 + a_2 and so on. See the example for a better understanding.

Mole can't eat all the worms (Marmot brought a lot) and, as we all know, Mole is blind, so Marmot tells him the labels of the best juicy worms. Marmot will only give Mole a worm if Mole says correctly in which pile this worm is contained.

Poor Mole asks for your help. For all juicy worms said by Marmot, tell Mole the correct answers.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of piles.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3, a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n} ≤ 10^6), where a_{i} is the number of worms in the i-th pile.

The third line contains single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), the number of juicy worms said by Marmot.

The fourth line contains m integers q_1, q_2, ..., q_{m} (1 ≤ q_{i} ≤ a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n}), the labels of the juicy worms.

-----Output-----

Print m lines to the standard output. The i-th line should contain an integer, representing the number of the pile where the worm labeled with the number q_{i} is.

You are playing a variation of game 2048. Initially you have a multiset $s$ of $n$ integers. Every integer in this multiset is a power of two. 

You may perform any number (possibly, zero) operations with this multiset.

During each operation you choose two equal integers from $s$, remove them from $s$ and insert the number equal to their sum into $s$.

For example, if $s = \{1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2\}$ and you choose integers $2$ and $2$, then the multiset becomes $\{1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 2\}$.

You win if the number $2048$ belongs to your multiset. For example, if $s = \{1024, 512, 512, 4\}$ you can win as follows: choose $512$ and $512$, your multiset turns into $\{1024, 1024, 4\}$. Then choose $1024$ and $1024$, your multiset turns into $\{2048, 4\}$ and you win.

You have to determine if you can win this game.

You have to answer $q$ independent queries.

-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 100$) – the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in multiset.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ ($1 \le s_i \le 2^{29}$) — the description of the multiset. It is guaranteed that all elements of the multiset are powers of two. 

-----Output-----

For each query print YES if it is possible to obtain the number $2048$ in your multiset, and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

-----Example-----

-----Note-----

In the first query you can win as follows: choose $512$ and $512$, and $s$ turns into $\{1024, 64, 1024\}$. Then choose $1024$ and $1024$, and $s$ turns into $\{2048, 64\}$ and you win.

In the second query $s$ contains $2048$ initially.

A mad scientist Dr.Jubal has made a competitive programming task. Try to solve it!

You are given integers $n,k$. Construct a grid $A$ with size $n \times n$ consisting of integers $0$ and $1$. The very important condition should be satisfied: the sum of all elements in the grid is exactly $k$. In other words, the number of $1$ in the grid is equal to $k$.

Let's define:  $A_{i,j}$ as the integer in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column.  $R_i = A_{i,1}+A_{i,2}+...+A_{i,n}$ (for all $1 \le i \le n$).  $C_j = A_{1,j}+A_{2,j}+...+A_{n,j}$ (for all $1 \le j \le n$).  In other words, $R_i$ are row sums and $C_j$ are column sums of the grid $A$.  For the grid $A$ let's define the value $f(A) = (\max(R)-\min(R))^2 + (\max(C)-\min(C))^2$ (here for an integer sequence $X$ we define $\max(X)$ as the maximum value in $X$ and $\min(X)$ as the minimum value in $X$). 

Find any grid $A$, which satisfies the following condition. Among such grids find any, for which the value $f(A)$ is the minimum possible. Among such tables, you can find any.

-----Input-----

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. Next $t$ lines contain descriptions of test cases.

For each test case the only line contains two integers $n$, $k$ $(1 \le n \le 300, 0 \le k \le n^2)$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n^2$ for all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.

-----Output-----

For each test case, firstly print the minimum possible value of $f(A)$ among all tables, for which the condition is satisfied.

After that, print $n$ lines contain $n$ characters each. The $j$-th character in the $i$-th line should be equal to $A_{i,j}$.

If there are multiple answers you can print any.

1111

-----Note-----

In the first test case, the sum of all elements in the grid is equal to $2$, so the condition is satisfied. $R_1 = 1, R_2 = 1$ and $C_1 = 1, C_2 = 1$. Then, $f(A) = (1-1)^2 + (1-1)^2 = 0$, which is the minimum possible value of $f(A)$.

In the second test case, the sum of all elements in the grid is equal to $8$, so the condition is satisfied. $R_1 = 3, R_2 = 3, R_3 = 2$ and $C_1 = 3, C_2 = 2, C_3 = 3$. Then, $f(A) = (3-2)^2 + (3-2)^2 = 2$. It can be proven, that it is the minimum possible value of $f(A)$.

You are given a permutation $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$. Recall that sequence of $n$ integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from $1$ to $n$ exactly once.

Find three indices $i$, $j$ and $k$ such that:   $1 \le i < j < k \le n$;  $p_i < p_j$ and $p_j > p_k$.  Or say that there are no such indices.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 200$) — the number of test cases.

Next $2T$ lines contain test cases — two lines per test case. The first line of each test case contains the single integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 1000$) — the length of the permutation $p$.

The second line contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$; $p_i \neq p_j$ if $i \neq j$) — the permutation $p$.

-----Output-----

For each test case:   if there are such indices $i$, $j$ and $k$, print YES (case insensitive) and the indices themselves;  if there are no such indices, print NO (case insensitive). 

If there are multiple valid triples of indices, print any of them.

Let's look at the following process: initially you have an empty stack and an array $s$ of the length $l$. You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. 

If after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.

There are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; 

Let's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. 

You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.

Note, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.

-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of array $a$.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) — the elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.

-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer in single line — the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $a$.

-----Example-----

-----Note-----

In the first query there are four stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 4} = [2, 1, 1, 2], a_{2 \ldots 3} = [1, 1], a_{2 \ldots 5} = [1, 1, 2, 2], a_{4 \ldots 5} = [2, 2]$.

In the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarray — $a_{3 \ldots 4}$.

In the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \ldots 8}, a_{2 \ldots 5}, a_{2 \ldots 7}, a_{2 \ldots 9}, a_{3 \ldots 4}, a_{6 \ldots 7}, a_{6 \ldots 9}, a_{8 \ldots 9}$.

Consider the following process. You have a binary string (a string where each character is either 0 or 1) $w$ of length $n$ and an integer $x$. You build a new binary string $s$ consisting of $n$ characters. The $i$-th character of $s$ is chosen as follows:

  if the character $w_{i-x}$ exists and is equal to 1, then $s_i$ is 1 (formally, if $i > x$ and $w_{i-x} = $ 1, then $s_i = $ 1);  if the character $w_{i+x}$ exists and is equal to 1, then $s_i$ is 1 (formally, if $i + x \le n$ and $w_{i+x} = $ 1, then $s_i = $ 1);  if both of the aforementioned conditions are false, then $s_i$ is 0. 

You are given the integer $x$ and the resulting string $s$. Reconstruct the original string $w$.

-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the resulting string $s$ ($2 \le |s| \le 10^5$, each character of $s$ is either 0 or 1). The second line contains one integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le |s| - 1$).

The total length of all strings $s$ in the input does not exceed $10^5$.

-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer on a separate line as follows:

  if no string $w$ can produce the string $s$ at the end of the process, print $-1$;  otherwise, print the binary string $w$ consisting of $|s|$ characters. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Alexandra has an even-length array $a$, consisting of $0$s and $1$s. The elements of the array are enumerated from $1$ to $n$. She wants to remove at most $\frac{n}{2}$ elements (where $n$ — length of array) in the way that alternating sum of the array will be equal $0$ (i.e. $a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \dotsc = 0$). In other words, Alexandra wants sum of all elements at the odd positions and sum of all elements at the even positions to become equal. The elements that you remove don't have to be consecutive.

For example, if she has $a = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]$ and she removes $2$nd and $4$th elements, $a$ will become equal $[1, 1, 0, 0]$ and its alternating sum is $1 - 1 + 0 - 0 = 0$.

Help her!

-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^3$, $n$ is even)  — length of the array.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1$)  — elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^3$.

-----Output-----

For each test case, firstly, print $k$ ($\frac{n}{2} \leq k \leq n$) — number of elements that will remain after removing in the order they appear in $a$. Then, print this $k$ numbers. Note that you should print the numbers themselves, not their indices.

We can show that an answer always exists. If there are several answers, you can output any of them.

-----Note-----

In the first and second cases, alternating sum of the array, obviously, equals $0$.

In the third case, alternating sum of the array equals $1 - 1 = 0$.

In the fourth case, alternating sum already equals $1 - 1 + 0 - 0 = 0$, so we don't have to remove anything.

Petya has come to the math exam and wants to solve as many problems as possible. He prepared and carefully studied the rules by which the exam passes.

The exam consists of $n$ problems that can be solved in $T$ minutes. Thus, the exam begins at time $0$ and ends at time $T$. Petya can leave the exam at any integer time from $0$ to $T$, inclusive.

All problems are divided into two types:   easy problems — Petya takes exactly $a$ minutes to solve any easy problem;  hard problems — Petya takes exactly $b$ minutes ($b > a$) to solve any hard problem. 

Thus, if Petya starts solving an easy problem at time $x$, then it will be solved at time $x+a$. Similarly, if at a time $x$ Petya starts to solve a hard problem, then it will be solved at time $x+b$.

For every problem, Petya knows if it is easy or hard. Also, for each problem is determined time $t_i$ ($0 \le t_i \le T$) at which it will become mandatory (required). If Petya leaves the exam at time $s$ and there is such a problem $i$ that $t_i \le s$ and he didn't solve it, then he will receive $0$ points for the whole exam. Otherwise (i.e if he has solved all such problems for which $t_i \le s$) he will receive a number of points equal to the number of solved problems. Note that leaving at time $s$ Petya can have both ""mandatory"" and ""non-mandatory"" problems solved.

For example, if $n=2$, $T=5$, $a=2$, $b=3$, the first problem is hard and $t_1=3$ and the second problem is easy and $t_2=2$. Then:  if he leaves at time $s=0$, then he will receive $0$ points since he will not have time to solve any problems;  if he leaves at time $s=1$, he will receive $0$ points since he will not have time to solve any problems;  if he leaves at time $s=2$, then he can get a $1$ point by solving the problem with the number $2$ (it must be solved in the range from $0$ to $2$);  if he leaves at time $s=3$, then he will receive $0$ points since at this moment both problems will be mandatory, but he will not be able to solve both of them;  if he leaves at time $s=4$, then he will receive $0$ points since at this moment both problems will be mandatory, but he will not be able to solve both of them;  if he leaves at time $s=5$, then he can get $2$ points by solving all problems. 

Thus, the answer to this test is $2$.

Help Petya to determine the maximal number of points that he can receive, before leaving the exam.

-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the test.

The next lines contain a description of $m$ test cases. 

The first line of each test case contains four integers $n, T, a, b$ ($2 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$, $1 \le T \le 10^9$, $1 \le a < b \le 10^9$) — the number of problems, minutes given for the exam and the time to solve an easy and hard problem, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains $n$ numbers $0$ or $1$, separated by single space: the $i$-th number means the type of the $i$-th problem. A value of $0$ means that the problem is easy, and a value of $1$ that the problem is hard.

The third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $t_i$ ($0 \le t_i \le T$), where the $i$-th number means the time at which the $i$-th problem will become mandatory.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ for all test cases does not exceed $2\cdot10^5$.

-----Output-----

Print the answers to $m$ test cases. For each set, print a single integer — maximal number of points that he can receive, before leaving the exam.

Chaneka has a hobby of playing with animal toys. Every toy has a different fun value, a real number. Chaneka has four boxes to store the toys with specification:   The first box stores toys with fun values in range of $(-\infty,-1]$.  The second box stores toys with fun values in range of $(-1, 0)$.  The third box stores toys with fun values in range of $(0, 1)$.  The fourth box stores toys with fun value in range of $[1, \infty)$. 

Chaneka has $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ toys in the first, second, third, and fourth box, respectively. One day she decides that she only wants one toy, a super toy. So she begins to create this super toy by sewing all the toys she has.

While the number of toys Chaneka has is more than 1, she takes two different toys randomly and then sews them together, creating a new toy. The fun value of this new toy is equal to the multiplication of fun values of the sewn toys. She then puts this new toy in the appropriate box. She repeats this process until she only has one toy. This last toy is the super toy, and the box that stores this toy is the special box.

As an observer, you only know the number of toys in each box initially but do not know their fun values. You also don't see the sequence of Chaneka's sewing. Determine which boxes can be the special box after Chaneka found her super toy.

-----Input-----

The first line has an integer $T$ $(1 \le T \le 5 \cdot 10^4)$, the number of test cases.

Every case contains a line with four space-separated integers $A$ $B$ $C$ $D$ $(0 \le A, B, C, D \le 10^6, A + B + C + D > 0)$, which denotes the number of toys in the first, second, third, and fourth box, respectively.

-----Output-----

For each case, print four space-separated strings. Each string represents the possibility that the first, second, third, and fourth box can be the special box from left to right.

For each box, print ""Ya"" (Without quotes, Indonesian for yes) if that box can be the special box. Print ""Tidak"" (Without quotes, Indonesian for No) otherwise.

-----Example-----
Input
2
1 2 0 1
0 1 0 0

Output
Ya Ya Tidak Tidak
Tidak Ya Tidak Tidak

-----Note-----

For the first case, here is a scenario where the first box is the special box:   The first box had toys with fun values $\{-3\}$.  The second box had toys with fun values $\{ -0.5, -0.5 \}$  The fourth box had toys with fun values $\{ 3 \}$ 

The sewing sequence:   Chaneka sews the toy with fun $-0.5$ and $-0.5$ to a toy with fun $0.25$ and then put it in the third box.  Chaneka sews the toy with fun $-3$ and $0.25$ to a toy with fun $-0.75$ and then put it in the second box.  Chaneka sews the toy with fun $-0.75$ and $3$ to a toy with fun $-1.25$ and then put it in the first box, which then became the special box. 

Here is a scenario where the second box ends up being the special box:   The first box had toys with fun values $\{-3\}$  The second box had toys with fun values $\{ -0.33, -0.25 \}$.  The fourth box had toys with fun values $\{ 3 \}$. 

The sewing sequence:   Chaneka sews the toy with fun $-3$ and $-0.33$ to a toy with fun $0.99$ and then put it in the third box.  Chaneka sews the toy with fun $0.99$ and $3$ to a toy with fun $2.97$ and then put in it the fourth box.  Chaneka sews the toy with fun $2.97$ and $-0.25$ to a toy with fun $-0.7425$ and then put it in the second box, which then became the special box.  There is only one toy for the second case, so Chaneka does not have to sew anything because that toy, by definition, is the super toy.

You play a computer game. In this game, you lead a party of $m$ heroes, and you have to clear a dungeon with $n$ monsters. Each monster is characterized by its power $a_i$. Each hero is characterized by his power $p_i$ and endurance $s_i$.

The heroes clear the dungeon day by day. In the beginning of each day, you choose a hero (exactly one) who is going to enter the dungeon this day.

When the hero enters the dungeon, he is challenged by the first monster which was not defeated during the previous days (so, if the heroes have already defeated $k$ monsters, the hero fights with the monster $k + 1$). When the hero fights the monster, there are two possible outcomes:

  if the monster's power is strictly greater than the hero's power, the hero retreats from the dungeon. The current day ends;  otherwise, the monster is defeated. 

After defeating a monster, the hero either continues fighting with the next monster or leaves the dungeon. He leaves the dungeon either if he has already defeated the number of monsters equal to his endurance during this day (so, the $i$-th hero cannot defeat more than $s_i$ monsters during each day), or if all monsters are defeated — otherwise, he fights with the next monster. When the hero leaves the dungeon, the current day ends.

Your goal is to defeat the last monster. What is the minimum number of days that you need to achieve your goal? Each day you have to use exactly one hero; it is possible that some heroes don't fight the monsters at all. Each hero can be used arbitrary number of times.

-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of monsters in the dungeon.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the power of the $i$-th monster.

The third line contains one integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of heroes in your party.

Then $m$ lines follow, each describing a hero. Each line contains two integers $p_i$ and $s_i$ ($1 \le p_i \le 10^9$, $1 \le s_i \le n$) — the power and the endurance of the $i$-th hero.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n + m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer — the minimum number of days you have to spend to defeat all of the monsters (or $-1$ if it is impossible).

Polycarp plays a computer game (yet again). In this game, he fights monsters using magic spells.

There are two types of spells: fire spell of power $x$ deals $x$ damage to the monster, and lightning spell of power $y$ deals $y$ damage to the monster and doubles the damage of the next spell Polycarp casts. Each spell can be cast only once per battle, but Polycarp can cast them in any order.

For example, suppose that Polycarp knows three spells: a fire spell of power $5$, a lightning spell of power $1$, and a lightning spell of power $8$. There are $6$ ways to choose the order in which he casts the spells:

  first, second, third. This order deals $5 + 1 + 2 \cdot 8 = 22$ damage;  first, third, second. This order deals $5 + 8 + 2 \cdot 1 = 15$ damage;  second, first, third. This order deals $1 + 2 \cdot 5 + 8 = 19$ damage;  second, third, first. This order deals $1 + 2 \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot 5 = 27$ damage;  third, first, second. This order deals $8 + 2 \cdot 5 + 1 = 19$ damage;  third, second, first. This order deals $8 + 2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 5 = 20$ damage. 

Initially, Polycarp knows $0$ spells. His spell set changes $n$ times, each time he either learns a new spell or forgets an already known one. After each change, calculate the maximum possible damage Polycarp may deal using the spells he knows.

-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of changes to the spell set.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $tp$ and $d$ ($0 \le tp_i \le 1$; $-10^9 \le d \le 10^9$; $d_i \neq 0$) — the description of the change. If $tp_i$ if equal to $0$, then Polycarp learns (or forgets) a fire spell, otherwise he learns (or forgets) a lightning spell.

If $d_i > 0$, then Polycarp learns a spell of power $d_i$. Otherwise, Polycarp forgets a spell with power $-d_i$, and it is guaranteed that he knew that spell before the change.

It is guaranteed that the powers of all spells Polycarp knows after each change are different (Polycarp never knows two spells with the same power).

-----Output-----

After each change, print the maximum damage Polycarp can deal with his current set of spells.

Given a list of strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence among them. The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be any subsequence of the other strings.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

The input will be a list of strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: ""aba"", ""cdc"", ""eae""
Output: 3

Note:

All the given strings' lengths will not exceed 10.
The length of the given list will be in the range of [2, 50].

Remember the story of Little Match Girl? By now, you know exactly what matchsticks the little match girl has, please find out a way you can make one square by using up all those matchsticks. You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.

 Your input will be several matchsticks the girl has, represented with their stick length. Your output will either be true or false, to represent whether you could make one square using all the matchsticks the little match girl has.

Example 1:

Input: [1,1,2,2,2]
Output: true

Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square came two sticks with length 1.

Example 2:

Input: [3,3,3,3,4]
Output: false

Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the matchsticks.

Note:

The length sum of the given matchsticks is in the range of 0 to 10^9.
The length of the given matchstick array will not exceed 15.

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

Example:

Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 

Note: 

       There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
       Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Given two arrays nums1 and nums2.
Return the maximum dot product between non-empty subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.
A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, [2,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,5,3] is not).

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [2,1,-2,5], nums2 = [3,0,-6]
Output: 18
Explanation: Take subsequence [2,-2] from nums1 and subsequence [3,-6] from nums2.
Their dot product is (2*3 + (-2)*(-6)) = 18.
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [3,-2], nums2 = [2,-6,7]
Output: 21
Explanation: Take subsequence [3] from nums1 and subsequence [7] from nums2.
Their dot product is (3*7) = 21.

You are given a list of preferences for n friends, where n is always even.
For each person i, preferences[i] contains a list of friends sorted in the order of preference. In other words, a friend earlier in the list is more preferred than a friend later in the list. Friends in each list are denoted by integers from 0 to n-1.
All the friends are divided into pairs. The pairings are given in a list pairs, where pairs[i] = [xi, yi] denotes xi is paired with yi and yi is paired with xi.
However, this pairing may cause some of the friends to be unhappy. A friend x is unhappy if x is paired with y and there exists a friend u who is paired with v but:

x prefers u over y, and
u prefers x over v.

Return the number of unhappy friends.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4, preferences = [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 0], [3, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0]], pairs = [[0, 1], [2, 3]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Friend 1 is unhappy because:
- 1 is paired with 0 but prefers 3 over 0, and
- 3 prefers 1 over 2.
Friend 3 is unhappy because:
- 3 is paired with 2 but prefers 1 over 2, and
- 1 prefers 3 over 0.
Friends 0 and 2 are happy.

Example 2:
Input: n = 2, preferences = [[1], [0]], pairs = [[1, 0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Both friends 0 and 1 are happy.

Example 3:
Input: n = 4, preferences = [[1, 3, 2], [2, 3, 0], [1, 3, 0], [0, 2, 1]], pairs = [[1, 3], [0, 2]]

Let's call any (contiguous) subarray B (of A) a mountain if the following properties hold:

B.length >= 3
There exists some 0 < i < B.length - 1 such that B[0] < B[1] < ... B[i-1] < B[i] > B[i+1] > ... > B[B.length - 1]

(Note that B could be any subarray of A, including the entire array A.)
Given an array A of integers, return the length of the longest mountain. 
Return 0 if there is no mountain.
Example 1:
Input: [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.

Example 2:
Input: [2,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no mountain.

Note:

0 <= A.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] <= 10000

Follow up:

Can you solve it using only one pass?
Can you solve it in O(1) space?

There are N piles of stones arranged in a row.  The i-th pile has stones[i] stones.
A move consists of merging exactly K consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these K piles.
Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.

Example 2:
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.

Example 3:
Input: stones = [3,5,1,2,6], K = 3
Output: 25
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].
We merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].
We merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].
The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.

We have a set of items: the i-th item has value values[i] and label labels[i].
Then, we choose a subset S of these items, such that:

|S| <= num_wanted
For every label L, the number of items in S with label L is <= use_limit.

Return the largest possible sum of the subset S.

Example 1:
Input: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,1,2,2,3], num_wanted = 3, use_limit = 1
Output: 9

Example 2:
Input: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,3,3,3,2], num_wanted = 3, use_limit = 2
Output: 12
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, second, and third item.

Example 3:
Input: values = [9,8,8,7,6], labels = [0,0,0,1,1], num_wanted = 3, use_limit = 1

On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north.  The robot can receive one of three instructions:

""G"": go straight 1 unit;
""L"": turn 90 degrees to the left;
""R"": turn 90 degress to the right.

The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.
Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

Example 1:
Input: ""GGLLGG""
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.

Example 2:
Input: ""GG""
Output: false
Explanation: 
The robot moves north indefinitely.

Example 3:
Input: ""GL""
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> ...

Given a number s in their binary representation. Return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:

If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.

If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.

It's guaranteed that you can always reach to one for all testcases.

Input: s = ""1101""
Output: 6
Explanation: ""1101"" corressponds to number 13 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 and obtain 14. 
Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 and obtain 8.
Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 4.

Given n boxes, each box is given in the format [status, candies, keys, containedBoxes] where:

status[i]: an integer which is 1 if box[i] is open and 0 if box[i] is closed.
candies[i]: an integer representing the number of candies in box[i].
keys[i]: an array contains the indices of the boxes you can open with the key in box[i].
containedBoxes[i]: an array contains the indices of the boxes found in box[i].

You will start with some boxes given in initialBoxes array. You can take all the candies in any open box and you can use the keys in it to open new boxes and you also can use the boxes you find in it.
Return the maximum number of candies you can get following the rules above.

Example 1:
Input: status = [1,0,1,0], candies = [7,5,4,100], keys = [[],[],[1],[]], containedBoxes = [[1,2],[3],[],[]], initialBoxes = [0]
Output: 16
Explanation: You will be initially given box 0. You will find 7 candies in it and boxes 1 and 2. Box 1 is closed and you don't have a key for it so you will open box 2. You will find 4 candies and a key to box 1 in box 2.
In box 1, you will find 5 candies and box 3 but you will not find a key to box 3 so box 3 will remain closed.
Total number of candies collected = 7 + 4 + 5 = 16 candy.

Example 2:
Input: status = [1,0,0,0,0,0], candies = [1,1,1,1,1,1], keys = [[1,2,3,4,5],[],[],[],[],[]], containedBoxes = [[1,2,3,4,5],[],[],[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [0]
Output: 6
Explanation: You have initially box 0. Opening it you can find boxes 1,2,3,4 and 5 and their keys. The total number of candies will be 6.

Example 3:
Input: status = [1,1,1], candies = [100,1,100], keys = [[],[0,2],[]], containedBoxes = [[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [1]
Output: 1

Example 4:
Input: status = [1], candies = [100], keys = [[]], containedBoxes = [[]], initialBoxes = []
Output: 0

Given an array of integers nums and an integer limit, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to limit.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2 
Explanation: All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
Output: 4 
Explanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0

Given 2n balls of k distinct colors. You will be given an integer array balls of size k where balls[i] is the number of balls of color i. 
All the balls will be shuffled uniformly at random, then we will distribute the first n balls to the first box and the remaining n balls to the other box (Please read the explanation of the second example carefully).
Please note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two balls of colors a and b, and two boxes [] and (), then the distribution [a] (b) is considered different than the distribution [b] (a) (Please read the explanation of the first example carefully).
We want to calculate the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls.

Example 1:
Input: balls = [1,1]
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:
- A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2
- A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2
In both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal. The probability is 2/2 = 1

Example 2:
Input: balls = [2,1,1]
Output: 0.66667
Explanation: We have the set of balls [1, 1, 2, 3]
This set of balls will be shuffled randomly and we may have one of the 12 distinct shuffles with equale probability (i.e. 1/12):
[1,1 / 2,3], [1,1 / 3,2], [1,2 / 1,3], [1,2 / 3,1], [1,3 / 1,2], [1,3 / 2,1], [2,1 / 1,3], [2,1 / 3,1], [2,3 / 1,1], [3,1 / 1,2], [3,1 / 2,1], [3,2 / 1,1]
After that we add the first two balls to the first box and the second two balls to the second box.
We can see that 8 of these 12 possible random distributions have the same number of distinct colors of balls in each box.
Probability is 8/12 = 0.66667

Example 3:
Input: balls = [1,2,1,2]
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: The set of balls is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]. It is hard to display all the 180 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 108 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.
Probability = 108 / 180 = 0.6

Example 4:
Input: balls = [3,2,1]
Output: 0.30000
Explanation: The set of balls is [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]. It is hard to display all the 60 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 18 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.
Probability = 18 / 60 = 0.3

Example 5:
Input: balls = [6,6,6,6,6,6]
Output: 0.90327

Constraints:

1 <= balls.length <= 8
1 <= balls[i] <= 6
sum(balls) is even.
Answers within 10^-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

You are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length consisting of letters ""x"" and ""y"" only. Your task is to make these two strings equal to each other. You can swap any two characters that belong to different strings, which means: swap s1[i] and s2[j].
Return the minimum number of swaps required to make s1 and s2 equal, or return -1 if it is impossible to do so.

Example 1:
Input: s1 = ""xx"", s2 = ""yy""
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap s1[0] and s2[1], s1 = ""yx"", s2 = ""yx"".
Example 2: 
Input: s1 = ""xy"", s2 = ""yx""
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Swap s1[0] and s2[0], s1 = ""yy"", s2 = ""xx"".
Swap s1[0] and s2[1], s1 = ""xy"", s2 = ""xy"".
Note that you can't swap s1[0] and s1[1] to make s1 equal to ""yx"", cause we can only swap chars in different strings.
Example 3:
Input: s1 = ""xx"", s2 = ""xy""
Output: -1

Given a string s and an array of integers cost where cost[i] is the cost of deleting the ith character in s.
Return the minimum cost of deletions such that there are no two identical letters next to each other.
Notice that you will delete the chosen characters at the same time, in other words, after deleting a character, the costs of deleting other characters will not change.

Example 1:
Input: s = ""abaac"", cost = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: Delete the letter ""a"" with cost 3 to get ""abac"" (String without two identical letters next to each other).

Example 2:
Input: s = ""abc"", cost = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to delete any character because there are no identical letters next to each other.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""aabaa"", cost = [1,2,3,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Delete the first and the last character, getting the string (""aba"").

You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height.  The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side.  Each steel support must be an equal height.
You have a collection of rods which can be welded together.  For example, if you have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a support of length 6.
Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation.  If you cannot support the billboard, return 0.

Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points.  After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.

You start with 0 points.  Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation: 
Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.

To some string S, we will perform some replacement operations that replace groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size).
Each replacement operation has 3 parameters: a starting index i, a source word x and a target word y.  The rule is that if x starts at position i in the original string S, then we will replace that occurrence of x with y.  If not, we do nothing.
For example, if we have S = ""abcd"" and we have some replacement operation i = 2, x = ""cd"", y = ""ffff"", then because ""cd"" starts at position 2 in the original string S, we will replace it with ""ffff"".
Using another example on S = ""abcd"", if we have both the replacement operation i = 0, x = ""ab"", y = ""eee"", as well as another replacement operation i = 2, x = ""ec"", y = ""ffff"", this second operation does nothing because in the original string S[2] = 'c', which doesn't match x[0] = 'e'.
All these operations occur simultaneously.  It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, S = ""abc"", indexes = [0, 1], sources = [""ab"",""bc""] is not a valid test case.
Example 1:
Input: S = ""abcd"", indexes = [0,2], sources = [""a"",""cd""], targets = [""eee"",""ffff""]
Output: ""eeebffff""
Explanation: ""a"" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by ""eee"".
""cd"" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by ""ffff"".

Example 2:
Input: S = ""abcd"", indexes = [0,2], sources = [""ab"",""ec""], targets = [""eee"",""ffff""]
Output: ""eeecd""
Explanation: ""ab"" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by ""eee"". 
""ec"" doesn't starts at index 2 in the original S, so we do nothing.

Notes:

0 <= indexes.length = sources.length = targets.length <= 100
0 < indexes[i] < S.length <= 1000

Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum sum of a falling path through A.
A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row.  The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The possible falling paths are:

[1,4,7], [1,4,8], [1,5,7], [1,5,8], [1,5,9]
[2,4,7], [2,4,8], [2,5,7], [2,5,8], [2,5,9], [2,6,8], [2,6,9]
[3,5,7], [3,5,8], [3,5,9], [3,6,8], [3,6,9]

The falling path with the smallest sum is [1,4,7], so the answer is 12.

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.

Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

Example 2:
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4

Given a m x n binary matrix mat. In one step, you can choose one cell and flip it and all the four neighbours of it if they exist (Flip is changing 1 to 0 and 0 to 1). A pair of cells are called neighboors if they share one edge.
Return the minimum number of steps required to convert mat to a zero matrix or -1 if you cannot.
Binary matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0 or 1 only.
Zero matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0.

Example 1:

Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible solution is to flip (1, 0) then (0, 1) and finally (1, 1) as shown.

Example 2:
Input: mat = [[0]]

You are given two images img1 and img2 both of size n x n, represented as binary, square matrices of the same size. (A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values.)
We translate one image however we choose (sliding it left, right, up, or down any number of units), and place it on top of the other image.  After, the overlap of this translation is the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.
(Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation.)
What is the largest possible overlap?

We are given a 2-dimensional grid. ""."" is an empty cell, ""#"" is a wall, ""@"" is the starting point, (""a"", ""b"", ...) are keys, and (""A"", ""B"", ...) are locks.
We start at the starting point, and one move consists of walking one space in one of the 4 cardinal directions.  We cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall.  If we walk over a key, we pick it up.  We can't walk over a lock unless we have the corresponding key.
For some 1 <= K <= 6, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first K letters of the English alphabet in the grid.  This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet.
Return the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys.  If it's impossible, return -1.

You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called ""bulls"") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called ""cows""). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows. 

Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.

Example 1:

Input: secret = ""1807"", guess = ""7810""

Output: ""1A3B""

Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.

Example 2:

Given an array nums, you are allowed to choose one element of nums and change it by any value in one move.
Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums after perfoming at most 3 moves.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Change the array [5,3,2,4] to [2,2,2,2].
The difference between the maximum and minimum is 2-2 = 0.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
Output: 1
Explanation: Change the array [1,5,0,10,14] to [1,1,0,1,1]. 
The difference between the maximum and minimum is 1-0 = 1.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [6,6,0,1,1,4,6]

Given an array of positive integers nums, remove the smallest subarray (possibly empty) such that the sum of the remaining elements is divisible by p. It is not allowed to remove the whole array.
Return the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or -1 if it's impossible.
A subarray is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,4,2], p = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray [4], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [6,3,5,2], p = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: We cannot remove a single element to get a sum divisible by 9. The best way is to remove the subarray [5,2], leaving us with [6,3] with sum 9.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], p = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Here the sum is 6. which is already divisible by 3. Thus we do not need to remove anything.

Example 4:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], p = 7
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way to remove a subarray in order to get a sum divisible by 7.

Example 5:
Input: nums = [1000000000,1000000000,1000000000], p = 3

Given an integer array A, and an integer target, return the number of tuples i, j, k  such that i < j < k and A[i] + A[j] + A[k] == target.
As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: A = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5], target = 8
Output: 20
Explanation: 
Enumerating by the values (A[i], A[j], A[k]):
(1, 2, 5) occurs 8 times;
(1, 3, 4) occurs 8 times;
(2, 2, 4) occurs 2 times;
(2, 3, 3) occurs 2 times.

We have n jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from startTime[i] to endTime[i], obtaining a profit of profit[i].
You're given the startTime , endTime and profit arrays, you need to output the maximum profit you can take such that there are no 2 jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.
If you choose a job that ends at time X you will be able to start another job that starts at time X.

Example 1:

Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.

Example 2:

Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.

Example 3:

Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
Output: 6

Constraints:

1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 10^4
1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 10^9
1 <= profit[i] <= 10^4

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.

Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

Note:

       Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
       Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

Example 1:

Input: ""42""
Output: 42

Example 2:

Input: ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.

Example 3:

Input: ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.

Example 4:

Input: ""words and 987""
Output: 0
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical 
             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.

Example 5:

Input: ""-91283472332""
Output: -2147483648
Explanation: The number ""-91283472332"" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
             Thefore INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
Process Q queries of the following two types:
 - Type 1: change the i_q-th character of S to c_q. (Do nothing if the i_q-th character is already c_q.)
 - Type 2: answer the number of different characters occurring in the substring of S between the l_q-th and r_q-th characters (inclusive).

-----Constraints-----
 - N, Q, i_q, l_q, and r_q are integers.
 - S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
 - c_q is a lowercase English letter.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 500000
 - 1 \leq Q \leq 20000
 - |S| = N
 - 1 \leq i_q \leq N
 - 1 \leq l_q \leq r_q \leq N
 - There is at least one query of type 2 in each testcase.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S
Q
Query_1
\vdots
Query_Q

Here, Query_i in the 4-th through (Q+3)-th lines is one of the following:
1 i_q c_q

2 l_q r_q

-----Output-----
For each query of type 2, print a line containing the answer.

-----Sample Input-----
7
abcdbbd
6
2 3 6
1 5 z
2 1 1
1 4 a
1 7 d
2 1 7

-----Sample Output-----

5

In the first query, cdbb contains three kinds of letters: b , c , and d, so we print 3.
In the second query, S is modified to abcdzbd.
In the third query, a contains one kind of letter: a, so we print 1.
In the fourth query, S is modified to abcazbd.
In the fifth query, S does not change and is still abcazbd.
In the sixth query, abcazbd contains five kinds of letters: a, b, c, d, and z, so we print 5.

Shashank is playing a game with his friends.
There are n sticks located in a row at points $a_1,a_2, ...,a_n$. Each stick has a height- $h_i$. A person can chop a stick down, after which it takes over one of the regions [$a_i$ - $h_i$, $a_i$] or [$a_i$, $a_i$ + $h_i$]. The stick that is not chopped remains at the point $a_i$. A person can chop a stick in a particular direction if the region to be taken up by the chopped stick does not overlap with an already existing point. The winner $($s$)$ of the game will be one or more people who can answer the question: What is the maximum number of sticks that can be chopped?
Shashank wants to win the game and hence he needs needs your help in finding out what is the maximum number of sticks that can be chopped down.

2021 was approaching and the world was about to end. So 2 gods Saurabhx and Saurabhy (from Celesta) created the Cyberverse. But this time disappointed with humans both the gods decided not to have humans in this world. So they created a world of cyborgs. A world without humans. Isn’t it interesting? So let us dive into the cyberverse and have a look at their problems.
There are $N$ kid cyborgs with Chief Cyborg '100gods' and he has $K$ weapons with him. He wants to distribute those $K$ weapons among $N$ kid cyborgs. Since all the kid cyborgs are very good friends, so they set a rule among themselves for taking those weapons. The rule states that the difference between kid cyborg having the maximum weapons and the kid cyborg having minimum weapons should be less than or equal to $1$.

Find the value of the minimum number of weapons a kid cyborg can have when all the $K$ weapons are distributed among them.

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each of the next $T$ lines will contain two space-separated integers denoting $N$ and $K$ respectively.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case ,output a single line containing an integer $X$ denoting the minimum number of weapons a kid cyborg can have in that test case.  

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq K \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
5 8

-----Expected Output:-----
1

-----Explanation-----
- There are $5$ kids and $8$ weapons.  
- Hence we will distribute the weapons such that $3$ kids have $2$ weapons each and the remaining $2$ kids have $1$ weapon each.  
- Hence the minimum number of weapons a kid cyborg has is $1$. (  That is, $min(1,2)$ = $1$ )

Sebi goes to school daily with his father. They cross a big highway in the car to reach to the school. Sebi sits in front seat beside his father at driving seat. To kill boredom, they play a game of guessing speed of other cars on the highway. Sebi makes a guess of other car's speed being SG kph, his father FG kph. 

The highway is usually empty, so the drivers use cruise control, i.e. vehicles run at a constant speed. There are markers on the highway at a gap of 50 meters. Both father-son duo wants to check the accuracy of their guesses. For that, they start a timer at the instant at which their car and the other car (which speed they are guessing) are parallel to each other (they need not to be against some marker, they can be in between the markers too). After some T seconds, they observe that both the cars are next to some markers and the number of markers in between the markers of their car and the other car is D - 1 (excluding the markers next to both the cars). Also, they can observe these markers easily because the other car is faster than their. Speed of Sebi's father's car is S. Using this information, one can find the speed of the other car accurately.

An example situation when Sebi's father starts the timer. Notice that both the car's are parallel to each other.

Example situation after T seconds. The cars are next to the markers. Here the value of D is 1. The green car is Sebi's and the other car is of blue color.

Sebi's a child, he does not know how to find the check whose guess is close to the real speed of the car. He does not trust his father as he thinks that he might cheat. Can you help to resolve this issue between them by telling whose guess is closer. If Sebi's guess is better, output ""SEBI"". If his father's guess is better, output ""FATHER"". If both the guess are equally close, then output ""DRAW"".

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
Each of the next T lines contain five space separated integers S, SG, FG, D, T corresponding to the Sebi's car speed, Sebi's guess, his father's guess, D as defined in the statement and the time at which both the cars at against the markers (in seconds), respectively.

-----Output-----
Output description.
For each test case, output a single line containing ""SEBI"", ""FATHER"" or ""DRAW"" (without quotes) denoting whose guess is better.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
- 0 ≤ S ≤ 130
- 0 ≤ SG, FG ≤ 300
- 1 ≤ D ≤ 30
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 300
-  The other car speed doesn't exceed 300 kph.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
100 180 200 20 60
130 131 132 1 72

Output:
SEBI
FATHER

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
There are total 20 - 1 = 19 markers in between the Sebi's car and the other car. So, the distance between those cars at time T is 20 * 50 = 1000 meters = 1 km.
As T = 60 seconds, i.e. 1 minutes. So, the other car goes 1 km more than Sebi's car in 1 minute. So, the other car will go 60 km more than Sebi's car in 1 hour. So, its speed is 60 kmph more than Sebi's car, i.e. 160 kmph.
Sebi had made a guess of 180 kmph, while his father of 200 kmph. Other car's real speed is 160 kmph. So, Sebi's guess is better than his father. Hence he wins the game.
Example case 2.

The situation of this example is depicted in the image provided in the statement. You can find the speed of other car and see that Father's guess is more accurate.

""Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange. In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only truth.""
-- Alphonse Elric
Now, here we have an equivalent exchange law for triangles which states that two right-angled isosceles triangles of the same color can be made into a square of the same color using Alchemy.
You are given N$N$ right-angled isosceles colored triangles numbered from 1$1$ to N$N$. For each triangle, the two equal sides have a length of 1$1$ unit. The Color of i$i$-th triangle is given by Ci$C_i$.
To create a tower, we choose some consecutive (2×k)+1$2 \times k)+1$ triangles for any k≥0$k \geq 0$. We then pick some 2×k$2 \times k$ of them (these need not be consecutive), and form k$k$ pairs of triangles such that both triangles in pair have the same color. Also, each of the 2×k$2 \times k$ should be in exactly one pair. Then the two triangles in each pair are joined using Alchemy (following the law of equivalent exchange for triangles) to form squares and these k$k$ squares are placed one upon other. The one remaining triangle is placed as a roof to the tower. This results in a tower of the height of k$k$.
Find the maximum height of the tower that can be formed. 
In other words, you should select the largest consecutive segment of triangles, such that you can form a tower using every single one of those triangles. In particular, you leave out one triangle, which will form the roof, and the other triangles should all be paired up such that both triangles in a pair have the same colour.

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains T$T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- For every test case, the first line contains N$N$ denoting the number of triangles.
- For every test case, the second line contains N$N$ space-separated integers Ci$C_{i}$ denoting the color of the triangles. ( 1≤i≤N$1 \leq i \leq N$).

-----Output:-----
For every test case, output a single integer denoting the maximum height of the tower that can be formed.

-----Constraints-----
- 1≤T≤100$1 \leq T \leq 100$ 
- 1≤N≤105$1 \leq N \leq 10^{5}$ 
- 1≤Ci≤30$1 \leq C_{i} \leq 30$

Chef has gone shopping with his 5-year old son. They have bought N items so far. The items are numbered from 1 to N, and the item i weighs Wi grams.

Chef's son insists on helping his father in carrying the items. He wants his dad to give him a few items. Chef does not want to burden his son. But he won't stop bothering him unless he is given a few items to carry. So Chef decides to give him some items. Obviously, Chef wants to give the kid less weight to carry.

However, his son is a smart kid. To avoid being given the bare minimum weight to carry, he suggests that the items are split into two groups, and one group contains exactly K items. Then Chef will carry the heavier group, and his son will carry the other group.

Help the Chef in deciding which items should the son take. Your task will be simple. Tell the Chef the maximum possible difference between the weight carried by him and the weight carried by the kid.

-----Input:-----
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test contains two space-separated integers N and K. The next line contains N space-separated integers W1, W2, ..., WN.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output the maximum possible difference between the weights carried by both in grams.

-----Constraints:-----

- 1 ≤ K < N ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ Wi ≤ 100000 (105)

5 2
8 4 5 2 10
8 3
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Output:

2

-----Explanation:-----
Case #1: The optimal way is that Chef gives his son K=2 items with weights 2 and 4. Chef carries the rest of the items himself. Thus the difference is: (8+5+10) − (4+2) = 23 − 6 = 17.

Case #2: Chef gives his son 3 items and he carries 5 items himself.

You are given a sequence of integers $A_1,A_2,…,A_N$ and a magical non-zero integer $x$
You have to select a subsegment of sequence A (possibly empty), and replace the elements in that subsegment after dividing them by x.
Formally, replace any one subsegment $A_l, A_{l+1}, ..., A_r$ with $A_l/x, A_{l+1}/x, ..., A_r/x$ where $l \leq r$
What is the minimum possible sum you can obtain?
Note: The given operation can only be performed once

-----Input -----
- The first line of the input contains two positive integer n denoting the size of array, and x
denoting the magical integer
- Next line contains $N$ space separated integers

-----Output-----

There are $M$ levels for a building numbered from $1$ to $M$ from top to bottom, each level having $N$ parking spots numbered from $1$ to $N$ from left to right. Some spots might have a car while other may be empty, the information of which is given in form of two dimensional character array $C$ ($C_{i, j}$ denote parking spot at $j$-th position on $i$-th level).
There is a thief who wants to unlock all the cars. Now, he is skilled such that for the first time, he can directly reach in any parking spot in no time. Basically he can reach the first car to be stolen in 0 time.
Now, he can move within the parking lot only in following manner, each taking 1 unit of time:
- Move down a level. That is, if current position is $(i, j)$, then he reaches $(i+1, j)$
- If current position is $(i, j)$ and if
- $i$ is odd, then he can move from $(i, j)$ to $(i, j+1)$
- $i$ is even, then he can move from $(i, j)$ to $(i, j-1)$
Note that he wants to unlock the cars in minimum time and the car is unlocked as soon as the thief reaches that parking spot.If the parking lot is empty, then the time taken is considered to be 0.  
Find the minimum time when all the cars would be unlocked. Note that once all cars are unlocked, the thief can escape instantly, so this time does not count.

-----Input :-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ (number of test cases).
- First liine of each test case contains $M$ and $N$(number of levels and spots per each level)  
- Next $M$ line contains $N$ space separated characters $C_{i, 1}, C_{i, 2} \ldots C_{i, N}$  where $(1\leq i\leq M)$ and $C_{i, j}$ is either $'P'$ or $'N'$ (without quotes).
If the spot contains $'P'$, then a car is parked there. else, it’s not parked.

-----Output :-----
For each test case print a single integer, the minimum time in which thief can unlock all cars.

-----Constraints :-----
- $1\leq T \leq100.$ 
- $1\leq M,N \leq300$ 

-----Subtasks :-----
- 
Subtask 1 (20 points): $1\leq M \leq2.$

-----Explanation:-----
In the first case, He will select the spot $(1,2)$ and the path he takes will be $(1,2)→(1,3)→(1,4)→(1,5)→(2,5)→(2,4)→(2,3)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(4,2)→(4,1)$

So, he takes 10 steps to unlock all the cars.
In the second case, He will select the spot $(1,2)$ and the path he takes will be $(1,2)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(2,2)→(2,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)$.
So, he takes 6 steps.

We all know that Share market is place where drastic change occurs within moments. So we have one Stockholder, Isabella, who wants to maximize her profit by selling her shares. She has $N$ shares of a Doofenshmirtz Corporation which is represented by $N$ different lines where each line contains two space separated integers $a_i$ , $b_i$ corresponding to initial and final values of the share prize. Isabella can sell any number of shares. But, she will sell those shares only if the following condition is satisfied - 
- for any pair $(i,j)$ of shares that she choses to sell, $a_i \leq a_j$  and $b_i < b_j$ must be satisfied. 
You need to tell Isabella the maximum number of Shares she can sell.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. 
- Each test case has the following format:
- First line of each test case contain single integer $N$, the number of shares of Isabella.  
- Next $N$ lines of each test case contain two space separated integers $a_i$, $b_i$ (initial and final value of share prize respectively) for each $1 \leq i \leq N$.

-----Output:-----
For each test case output a single integer: the maximum number of shares that can be sold by Isabella.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$

Dexter, being irritated by DD, gave her a lucrative game to play to keep her busy.
There are $N$ bags numbered $1$ to $N$. The $i_{th}$ bag contains $A_i$ coins. The bags are placed in a circular order such that the $N_{th}$ bag is adjacent to the $1^{st}$ bag. 
DD can select $K$ consecutive adjacent bags and take all the coins in them.   Help her find the maximum number of coins she can take by making the ideal choice.
Note that the selected bags must be consecutive. Since they are placed in circular order, bag number $1$ and $N$ are considered to be consecutive.

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- First-line contains $N$ and $K$.
- Second-line contains $N$ numbers $A_1, A_2,...,A_N$,  

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line, the maximum money that can be collected by DD.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $5 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq K < N$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 10^5$

Sheldon is a little geek living in Texas. While his friends like to play outside, little Sheldon likes to play around with ICs and lasers in his house. He decides to build N clap activated toggle machines each with one power inlet and one outlet. Each machine works when its power source inlet is receiving power. When the machine is in 'ON' state and is receiving power at its inlet, it makes power available at its power outlet to which a bulb or another ToGgLe machine could be attached.

Suppose Sheldon attached 2 such machines to one another with the power inlet of the first machine attached to a power source at his house and the outlet of the second machine to a bulb. Initially both machines are in 'OFF' state and power source to first machine is off too. Now the power source is switched on. The first machine receives power but being in the 'OFF' state it does not transmit any power. Now on clapping the first ToGgLe machine toggles to 'ON' and the second machine receives power. On clapping once more the first toggles to 'OFF' and the second toggles to 'ON'. But since the second ToGgLe machine receives no power the bulb does not light up yet. On clapping once more, the first machine which is still receiving power from the source toggles to 'ON' and the second which was already 'ON' does not toggle since it was not receiving power. So both the machine are in 'ON' state and the bulb lights up and little Sheldon is happy.

But when Sheldon goes out for a while, his evil twin sister attaches N such ToGgLe machines (after making sure they were all in 'OFF' state) and attaches the first to a power source (the power source is initially switched off) and the last ToGgLe machine to a bulb. Sheldon is horrified to find that his careful arrangement has been disturbed.

Coders, help the poor boy by finding out if clapping k times for the N ToGgLe machines (all in 'OFF' state with the first one connected to a switched off power source and last one to a bulb) would light the bulb. Hurry before Sheldon has a nervous breakdown!

-----Input-----
First line has number of test cases, T.

Following T lines have N, k separated by a single space where N is the number of 
ToGgLe machines and k is the number of times Sheldon clapped.

-----Output-----
T lines with cach line of the form: ""ON"" (just the word on without the double quotes) if the bulb is 'ON' for the 
test case numbered n and ""OFF"" (just the word off without the double quotes) if the bulb is 'OFF' for the test case numbered n.

Chef is given a sequence of prime numbers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. This sequence has exactly $2^N$ subsequences. A subsequence of $A$ is good if it does not contain any two identical numbers; in particular, the empty sequence is good.
Chef has to find the number of good subsequences which contain at most $K$ numbers. Since he does not know much about subsequences, help him find the answer. This number could be very large, so compute it modulo $1,000,000,007$.

A key feature of the Siruseri railway network is that it has exactly one route between any pair of stations.
The government has chosen three contractors to run the canteens at the stations on the railway network. To ensure that there are no disputes between the contractors it has been decided that if two stations, say $A$ and $B$, are assigned to a particular contractor then all the stations that lie on the route from $A$ to $B$ will also be awarded to the same contractor.
The government would like the assignment of stations to the contractors to be as equitable as possible. The government has data on the number of passengers who pass through each station each year. They would like to assign stations so that the maximum number of passengers passing through any contractor's collection of stations is minimized.
For instance, suppose the railway network is as follows, where the volume of passenger traffic is indicated by the side of each station.

One possible assignment would to award stations $1$ and $3$ to one contractor (there by giving him a traffic of $35$ passengers), station $2$ to the second contractor (traffic of $20$) and stations $4, 5$ and $6$ to the third contractor (traffic of $100$). In this assignment, the maximum traffic for any one contractor is 100. On the other hand if we assigned stations $1, 2$ and $3$ to one contractor, station $4$ and $6$ to the second contractor and station $5$ to the third contractor the maximum traffic for any one contractor is $70$. You can check that you cannot do better. (The assignment $1$, $2$ and $3$ to one contractor, $4$ to the second contractor, and $5$ and $6$ to the third contractor has a lower value for the maximum traffic ($55$) but it is not a valid assignment as the route from $5$ to $6$ passes through $4$.)

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains one integer $N$ indicating the number of railways stations in the network. The stations are numbered $1,2,..., N$. This is followed by $N$ lines of input, lines $2,3,...,N+1$, indicating the volume of traffic at each station. The volume of traffic at station $i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, is given by a single integer in line $i+1$. The next $N-1$ lines of input, lines $N+2, N+3, ..., 2 \cdot N$, describe the railway network. Each of these lines contains two integers, denoting a pair of stations that are neighbours.

-----Output:-----
The output should be a single integer, corresponding to the minimum possible value of the maximum traffic of any contractor among all valid assignment of the stations to the three contractors.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 3000$.

Chef is the event manager of his college. He has been assigned the task to manage the upcoming tech fest. There are $K$ rooms where the event can take place, and at a particular time only one event can be organized in a room for a particular time interval.
Each event coordinator has their strictly preferred room $P_i$, and if the room is already occupied he simply cancels that event.Chef wants to maximize the total number of events,and so he allows or disallows certain events in order to achieve the task . Chef is busy handling his events so the chef needs your help .
Given a list of $N$ events with their start time $S_i$,end time $E_i$ and preferred room $P_i$,you need to calculate the maximum number of events that can take place.
Note that the $i$th event wants to occupy the $p_i$ room from [$s_i$, $f_i$) .

-----Input:-----
The first line contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases . Each of the next $T$ lines contains two integers $N$ and $K$ , the number of events and the number of rooms respectively . Each of the next $N$ lines contains three integers $s_i$ ,$e_i$ and $p_i$,the start time ,end time and the preferred room of ith event.

-----Output:-----
Print the maximum number of events that can take place.

In these quarantine days, Chef and Chefina are getting bored. So, Chef came up with a game for her. He gets a pack of cards with numbers written on them. Chef then asks her to remove cards from the pack in the following manner: Chefina can choose any 3 cards at a time, having unique values, and remove the smallest and largest of them, and put back the middle one. For example, say Chefina chooses 3 cards that have numbers $x$, $y$, $z$ on them, such that $x <= y <= z$. Then she can throw away cards with number $x$ and $z$, but has to put the card with number $y$ on it back into the pack. Chefina can repeat this process any number of times. As soon as the pack contains cards with unique numbers, the game ends. If Chefina can determine the count of cards that will remain in the end, and tell it to Chef beforehand, she wins the game. Chefina asks for your help to win this game. Given the number written on the cards, help her find the count of cards in the pack when she wins.
$Note:$ You need to maximize the array length or the number of unique elements

-----Input:-----
- The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. Description of $T$ test cases follow.
- The first line of each test case consists of a single integer $N$, denoting the number of cards in the pack
- The next line consists of $N$ space separated numbers $A1$, $A2$ … $An$. For each valid $i (1 <= i <= N)$, the $i$-th card has the number $Ai$ written on it.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print the count of the cards that remain in the end.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 500$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^6$
- $1 \leq Ai \leq N$

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Test case 1:
Chefina chooses the cards with number: 2, 3, 5, throws away 2 & 5, and puts back 3. So, the pack now contains cards with numbers: 1, 2, 3. Since the pack contains cards with unique numbers only, these are the 3 final cards. 
Test case 2:
Chefina chooses the cards with number: 2, 3, 8, throws away 2 & 8,  and puts back 3. Now the pack contains cards with numbers: 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 8, 9. Next, she chooses cards with number: 3, 5, 8 throws away 3 & 8, and puts back 5. Now the pack contains cards with number: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9. Since the pack contains cards with unique numbers only, these are the 5 final cards.
Note: There might be multiple options to choose the 3 cards from the pack in any turn

Chef had a sequence of positive integers with length $N + K$. He managed to calculate the arithmetic average of all elements of this sequence (let's denote it by $V$), but then, his little brother deleted $K$ elements from it. All deleted elements had the same value.
Chef still knows the remaining $N$ elements — a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. Help him with restoring the original sequence by finding the value of the deleted elements or deciding that there is some mistake and the described scenario is impossible.
Note that the if it is possible for the deleted elements to have the same value, then it can be proven that it is unique. Also note that this value must be a positive integer.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $K$ and $V$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the value of the deleted elements, or $-1$ if there is a mistake.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N, K \le 100$

There is an event in DUCS where boys get a chance to show off their skills to impress girls. The boy who impresses the maximum number of girls will be honoured with the title “Charming Boy of the year”.
There are $N$ girls in the department. Each girl gives the name of a boy who impressed her the most. You need to find the name of a boy who will be honoured with the title. 
If there are more than one possible winners, then the one with the lexicographically smallest name is given the title. 
It is guaranteed that each boy participating in the event has a unique name.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. 
- The first line of each test case contains an integer $N$ denoting the number of girls.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated strings $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N$, denoting the respective names given by the girls.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing a string — the name of the boy who impressed the maximum number of girls. In case of a tie, print the lexicographically smallest name.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq |S_i| \leq 10$, for each valid $i$
$(|S_i|$ is the length of the string $S_i)$
- For each valid $i$, $S_i$ contains only lowercase English alphabets
- Sum of $N$ over all the test cases is $\leq 10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points: $1 \leq N \leq 100$
- 70 points: original constraints

There is crazy man named P29892P. He always tries to do crazy things as he thinks. One day he invented a machine and named it as ANGEN. The ANGEN is used to perform range operations. The range operation means performing operations on range values from {L..R}. At any time it performs operations on values in between L to R.
ANGEN can perform following operations
U I V - Update the value present at I  with value V
A L R - Find the sum between range L and R
M L R - Find the maximum number between L and R
m L R - Find the minimum number between L and R
S L R - Find second maximum value in between L and R
s L R - Find second mimimum value in between L and R
If it is not possible perform operation ANGEN returns “NA” with out quotes.
For Invalid operations ANGEN returns “!!!” with out quotes.
Now P29892P challenging his friends and you too, to build his invention with yourown code. So it's your time to defeat P29892P by implementing his invention with your own ability. Let's go and solve the problem.

-----Input-----

Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Sample Output:-----

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

It's John's birthday; he has brought some candies in distribute among N of his friends. Being a good friend, he decided to distribute all of his candies equally among his friend and he don't want to keep any for himself. He left the task of distributing candies up to his friends, but his friends haven't done a great job in distributing them and now they all have unequal amount of candies.
He asked all of his friends to keep all the candies in their hands (A[1] to A[N]) so that he can redistribute the candies. Taking a candy away from someone makes them sad and makes the person who gets it happy. Thus, you do not want to do many operations on the number of candies.
Here each operation stands for, taking away 1 candy from someone and giving it to somebody else.
After applying the operations, he might not be able to distribute all the candies among all of your friends, and you might need to buy some more candies as well. Buying each candy will be counted as 1 operation as well. John is saving up for his birthday party in the evening and so he wants to spend the least amount of money on candies as possible.
Thus, he asks for your help. You have to find the minimum number of operations required to make the distributions equal.

-----Input:-----
- The first line consists of the number T representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of 2 lines.
- The first line contains of the number N representing the number of friends.
- The second line contains space separated numbers (A[1] to A[N]) representing the number of candies each friend currently has.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, you much print the minimum number of operations.

Every Friday Chef and his N - 1 friends go for a party. At these parties, they play board games. This Friday, they are playing a game named ""Boats! Boats! Boats!"". In this game players have to transport cookies between Venice and Constantinople. Each player has a personal storage. The players are numbered from 1 to N, Chef is numbered 1. Rules for determining a winner are very difficult, therefore Chef asks you to write a program, which will determine who is a winner. 

There are 6 types of cookies. For each cookie in the storage player gets 1 point. Also player gets additional points if he packs his cookies in some boxes as follows: 

- A box containing 4 different types of cookies fetches 1 additional point.
- A box containing 5 different types of cookies fetches 2 additional points.
- A box containing 6 different types of cookies fetches 4 additional points.

Obviously a cookie can be put into a single box.

For each player, you know the number of cookies in his storage (denoted by c[i]), also the types of cookies in the storage given denoted by type[i][j].

Your task is to determine the winner of this game. Output ""tie"" if there are two or more players with same maximum score, ""chef"" if only Chef has a maximum score, winner's index in all other cases.

-----Input-----

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. This will be followed by T test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of players.
The second line of each test case contains an integer c[i] denoting the number of cookies in the i-th storage, followed by c[i] space-separated integers type[i][j] which denote the type if j-th cookie in the storage i-th.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer as specified in the statement.

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
Chef has total 6 cookie, so he gets 6 points for that. Also, he can put all his cookies (as they are all distinct) in a bag of size 6. It will fetch him additional 4 points. So, Chef's total points will be 10.
The second player has 9 cookies, he gets 9 points for that. Other than this, he can't create a bag with either 4, 5 or 6 distinct cookies. So, his final score is 9.
10 > 9 - Chef wins.
Example case 2.
Chef has 5 + 2 (a bag with 5 different cookies) = 7.
The second player has 7 + 1(a bag with 4 different cookies) = 8.
7 < 8 - the second player wins.
Example case 3.
Every player has 4 cookies and can't create any bag of sweets. So, it's a tie.

-----Indian National Olympiad in Informatics 2014-----
Nikhil’s slogan has won the contest conducted by Drongo Airlines and he is entitled to a free ticket between any two destinations served by the airline. All cities served by Drongo Airlines can be reached from each other by some sequence of connecting flights. Nikhil is allowed to take as many connecting flights as needed, but he must take the cheapest route between his chosen destinations.
Each direct flight between two cities has a fixed price. All pairs of cities connected by direct flights have flights in both directions and the price is the same in either direction. The price for a sequence of connecting flights is the sum of the prices of the direct flights along the route.
Nikhil has information about the cost of each direct flight. He would like to maximize the value of his prize, so he would like to choose a pair of cities on the network for which the cost of the cheapest route is as high as possible.
For instance, suppose the network consists of four cities {1, 2, 3, 4}, connected as shown on the right.
In this case, Nikhil should choose to travel between 1 and 4, where the cheapest route has cost 19. You can check that for all other pairs of cities, the cheapest route has a smaller cost. For instance, notice that though the direct flight from 1 to 3 costs 24, there is a cheaper route of cost 12 from 1 to 2 to 3.

-----Input Format:-----
- Line 1 : Two space-separated integers, C and F . C is the number of cities on the network, numbered 1, 2, . . . , C. F is the number of pairs of cities connected by a direct flight
- Lines 2 to F + 1 : Each line describes one direct flight between a pair of cities and consists of three integers, x, y and p, where x and y are the two cities connected by this flight and p is the price of this
For all direct flights, $x \neq y$, and no pair of cities is connected by more than one direct flight. If there is a direct flight from x to y with price p, there is also a flight from y to x with price p and exactly one of these two will be listed.

-----Output Format-----
- The output consists of a single integer, the maximum cost among the cheapest routes between all pairs of cities across the airline’s network.

-----Test Data-----
The testdata is grouped into three subtasks. In all subtasks, 2 ≤ C ≤ 230 and 1 ≤ F ≤ 23665. In addition, each subtask has the following constraints on the inputs.
- Subtask 1 (20 marks) : F = C − 1 (that is, the airline network is a tree) and p = 1 for each direct flight.
- Subtask 2 (30 marks) : There is no constraint on the shape of the network, but for each direct flight, p = 1.
- Subtask 3 (50 marks) : There is no constraint on the shape of the network, but for each direct flight, 0 ≤ p ≤ $10^5$.

-----Sample Input-----
4 5
1 2 10
1 3 24
2 3 2

Chef received a new sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. He does not like arbitrarily ordered sequences, so he wants to permute the elements of $A$ in such a way that it would satisfy the following condition: there is an integer $p$ ($1 \le p \le N$) such that the first $p$ elements of the new (permuted) sequence are strictly increasing and the last $N-p+1$ elements are strictly decreasing.
Help Chef and find a permutation of the given sequence which satisfies this condition or determine that no such permutation exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case:
- If there is no permutation of $A$ that satisfies the given condition, print a single line containing the string ""NO"" (without quotes).
- Otherwise, print two lines.
- The first of these lines should contain the string ""YES"" (without quotes).
- The second line should contain $N$ space-separated integers ― the elements of your permuted sequence.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (50 points):
- $N \le 10^3$
- $A_i \le 2 \cdot 10^3$ for each valid $i$

Sereja has a string A consisting of n lower case English letters. 

Sereja calls two strings X and Y each of length n similar if they can be made equal by applying the following operation at most once in each of them.

- Chose any two position i, j in the string (i can be equal to j too). Swap the characters at position i with character at position j.

For example strings ""abcd"" and ""acbd"" are similar, strings ""ab"" and ""ab"" are similar, but strings ""abcde"" and ""bcdea"" are not similar. Note that strings  ""abc"" and ""cab"" are also similar, as you can swap 'a' and 'c' in the first string to get ""cba"" and 'a' and 'b' in the second string to get ""cba"". 

Now Sereja is interested in finding number of ordered pairs of non similar strings X and Y such that they can be constructed from a given string A by permutation of its characters. As answer could be large, please output your answer modulo  (109 + 7).

Note 

A string s (of size n) is said to be constructed from string t (also of size n) by permutation of its characters if there exists a permutation P (of length n), such that s[i] = t[P[i]] for each i from 1 to n.

-----Input-----
- First line contain integer T - number of test cases. 
- For each of the next T lines: 

- Each line contains a string A as defined in the problem.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output answer modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7) in separate line. 

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤  10 
- 1 ≤ n ≤  10^5

You are given an array $a$ of length $n$. A subsequence of this array is valid, if it satisfies these two conditions:
- There shouldn't be any two even numbers within a distance of $K$, both which have been chosen in the subsequence. i.e. there shouldn't be two indices $i, j$ such that $a_i$ and $a_j$ are even, $|i - j| \leq K$ and $a_i$ and $a_j$ are in the subsequence. 
- Similarly, there shouldn't be any two odd numbers within a distance of $K$, both which have been chosen in the subsequence
The sum of a subsequence is the sum of all the numbers in it. Your task is find the maximum sum possible in a valid subsequence of the given array. Print this maximum sum.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $n, k$.
- The second line of each test case contains $n$ space-separated integers denoting the array $a$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output an integer corresponding to the answer of the problem.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le n \leq 10^5$
- $1 \le k \leq  n$

Sultan, the freestyle wrestler, you all know him. He broke multiple records in the history of all wrestling leagues. Now 20 years have passed, Sultan has grown old. He has two sons, he wants them to be like him. Sultan being orthodox goes to his astrologer, where he is told that his sons shall be invincible like him. 
Sultan starts to train them. After training, his son Multan & Fultan, having strengths are M and F respectively, decide to fight. They can defeat if the strength of challengers Si is a positive integer multiple of their strength else they lose. Multan fights first, then Fultan. A challenger once knocked out cannot challenge them again. Sultan's sons are still not very good wrestlers. Sultan considers them wrestlers if they both combined are able to win at least 70% of the all the fights. Also, he wants to know who is a better wrestler of the two. Your task is to help Sultan in this venture. Print ""Yes"" (without quotes) if they are able to win, else print ""No"" (without quotes). If yes, also name whether, ""Multan"" or ""Fultan"" is a better wrestler, if both win equally print “Both”.

-----Input-----
- First line contains single integer T denoting test cases.
- Second Line contains single integer N for number of challengers.
- Third Line contains space separated two integer denoting strength M & F
- Next Line contains strength space separated N integer ith of which denoting Si of N challengers respectively.

- The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains N.
- The following line contains N space-separated integers A1..N.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output one line with N space-separated integers - the lengths of the longest alternating subarray starting at x, for each x from 1 to N.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
- -109 ≤ Ai ≤ 109

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4
1 2 3 4
4
1 -5 1 -5
6
-5 -1 -1 2 -2 -3

Output:
1 1 1 1
4 3 2 1
1 1 3 2 1 1

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. No two elements have different signs, so any alternating subarray may only consist of a single number.
Example case 2. Every subarray is alternating.
Example case 3. The only alternating subarray of length 3 is A3..5.

Zonal Computing Olympiad 2013, 10 Nov 2012

Little Red Riding Hood is carrying a basket with berries through the forest to her grandmother's house.  The forest is arranged in the form of a square N × N grid of cells.  The top left corner cell, where Little Red Riding Hood starts her journey, is numbered (1,1) and the bottom right corner cell, where her grandmother lives, is numbered (N,N).  In each step, she can move either one position right or one position down.

The forest is full of dangerous wolves and she is looking for a safe path to reach her destination.  Little Red Riding Hood's fairy godmother has placed some special anti-wolf magical charms in some of the cells in the grid.  Each charm has a strength.  If the charm in cell (i,j) has strength k then its zone of influence is all the cells within k steps of (i,j); that is, all cells (i',j') such that |i - i'| + |j - j'| ≤ k.  A cell within the zone of influence of a charm is safe from wolves.  A safe path from (1,1) to (N,N) is one in which every cell along the path is safe.

Little Red Riding Hood is carrying a basket with berries. In each cell, she drops some berries while pushing her way through the thick forest.  However, sometimes she is also able to pick up fresh berries.  Each cell is labelled with an integer that indicates the net change in the number of berries in her basket on passing through the cell; that is, the number of berries she picks up in that cell minus the number of berries she drops.  You can assume that there are enough berries in her basket to start with so that the basket never becomes empty.

Little Red Riding Hood knows the positions and strengths of all the magic charms and is looking for a safe path along which the number of berries she has in the basket when she reaches her grandmother's house is maximized.

As an example consider the following grid:

3  3  2  4  3 
2  1 -1 -2  2  
-1  2  4  3 -3  
-2  2  3  2  1  
3 -1  2 -1  2  

Suppose there are 3 magic charms, at position (1,2) with strength 2, at position (4,5) with strength 2 and one at position (4,2) with strength 1.  The positions within the zone of influence of these three charms are indicated in the three grids below using X's.  

X  X  X  X  .         .  .  .  .  .         .  .  .  .  .
X  X  X  .  .         .  .  .  .  X         .  .  .  .  .
.  X  .  .  .         .  .  .  X  X         .  X  .  .  .
.  .  .  .  .         .  .  X  X  X         X  X  X  .  .
.  .  .  .  .         .  .  .  X  X         .  X  .  .  .

Putting these together, the cells that are under the zone of influence of at least one charm are marked with X below.

X  X  X  X  .
X  X  X  .  X
.  X  .  X  X
X  X  X  X  X
.  X  .  X  X

Here are two examples of safe paths in this grid, marked using Y's.  

Y  Y  X  X  .          Y  X  X  X  .
X  Y  X  .  X          Y  Y  X  .  X
.  Y  .  X  X          .  Y  .  X  X
X  Y  Y  Y  Y          X  Y  Y  Y  X
.  X  .  X  Y          .  X  .  Y  Y

Along the first path, she accumulates 19 berries while on the second path she collects 16 berries.  You can verify that among all safe paths, the maximum number of berries she can collect is 19. 

Your task is to help Little Red Riding Hood find out if there is at least one safe path and, if so, compute the maximum number of berries she can collect among all safe paths (which may be a negative number, in which case it is the minimum number of berries she will lose among all safe paths).

-----Input format-----
Line 1: Two space separated integers N and M, giving the dimension of the grid and the number of magic charms, respectively

Lines 2 to N+1: These N lines desribe the grid.  Line i+1 contains N space separated integers, describing the net change in berries in the N cells along row i of the grid.

Lines N+2 to N+M+1: These M lines describe the magic charms.  Each of these lines has 3 integers: the first two integers describe the position of the charm in the grid and the third integer describes its strength.

-----Output format-----
The first line of output must either consist of the word YES, if there are safe paths, or the word NO, if there are no safe paths. If the output on the first line is YES then the second line should contain a single integer giving the maximum number of berries Little Red Riding Hood can collect among all safe paths.  

-----Sample Input-----

1 2 2
4 5 2
4 2 1

-----Sample Output-----
YES
19

-----Test data-----
In all subtasks, you may assume that 2 ≤ N ≤ 500.  Each value on the grid is guaranteed to have absolute value not more than 1000. 
Let K denote the maximum strength among all the magic charms.
- Subtask 1 (30 marks) : 1 ≤ M ≤ 10, 1 ≤ K ≤ 1,000.
- Subtask 2 (70 marks) : 1 ≤ M ≤ 10,000, 1 ≤ K ≤ 10.

In poker, you have 5 cards. There are 10 kinds of poker hands (from highest to lowest):

-  royal flush - ace, king, queen, jack and ten, all in the same suit

-  straight flush - five cards of the same suit in sequence, such
as 10,9,8,7,6 of clubs; ace can be counted both as the highest card or as the
lowest card - A,2,3,4,5 of hearts is a straight flush. But 4,3,2,A,K of hearts is not a straight flush - it's just a flush.

-  four of a kind - four cards of the same rank, such as four kings.

-  full house - three cards of one rank plus two cards of another rank

-  flush - five cards of the same suit (but not a straight flush)

-  straight - five cards in order - just like the straight flush, but mixed suits

-  three of a kind - three cards of one rank and two other cards

-  two pairs - two cards of one rank, two cards of another rank, and one more card

-  pair - two cards of the same rank

-  high card - none of the above

Write a program that will help you play poker by telling you what kind of hand you have.

-----Input-----

The first line of input contains the number of test cases (no more than 20). Each test case consists of one line - five space separated cards. Each card is represented by a two-letter (or digit) word. The first character is the rank (A,K,Q,J,T,9,8,7,6,5,4,3 or 2), the second character is the suit (S,H,D,C standing for spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs). The cards can be in any order (but they will not repeat).

-----Output-----

For each test case output one line describing the type of a hand, exactly like in the list above.

-----Example-----
Input:

John was learning mathematics and was very bored. Jane his best friend gave him a problem to solve. 
The description of the problem was as follows:- 
You are given a decimal number $N$(1<=$N$<=$10^9$) and three integers $A$, $B$, $C$. 
Steps to perform:
1) You have to create a $LIST$. 
2) You have to initialize the $LIST$ by adding N to the $LIST$ as its first element. 
3) Divide$N$ by $A$ and if the first digit of the fractional part is Non-Zero then add this digit to the  $LIST$ otherwise add the first digit of the integral part(Leftmost digit).
(The integer part or integral part of a decimal is the integer written to the left of the decimal separator.  The part from the decimal separator i.e to the right is the fractional part. )
4) Update $N$  by Last element of the $LIST$. 
N = Last element of $LIST$
5) You have to perform the same process from step 3 on $N$ for $B$ and $C$ respectively 
6) Repeat from step 3 
You have to answer$Q$(1 <= $Q$<= 100 ) queries
For each query you are given an integer $i$ (0 <= $i$ <= $10^9$ ). You have to print the element present at the ith position of the $LIST$. 
Help John solve this problem.

-----Input:-----
- The First Line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The First Line of each test case contains the  integer $N$.
- The second line of each test case contains three integers $A$, $B$, and $C$ separated by a space
- The third line of each test case contains an integer $Q$.
- Then the next $Q$ line follows.  
- An integer $i$ (0 <= $i$ <= 10^9 )

-----Output:-----
You have to answer the $Q$ queries in the next $Q$ lines. 

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^9$
- $2 \leq A \leq 10$
- $2 \leq B \leq 10$
- $2 \leq C \leq 10$
- $2 \leq Q \leq 100$
- $0 \leq i \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
56
3 5 7
4

-----Sample Output:-----
56

-----EXPLANATION:-----
This list is :
$N$ = 56 and $A$ = 3, $B$ = 5, $C$ = 7. 
Initially $LIST$ = $[ 56 ]$
$N$$/$$A$ =  56/3 = 18.666666666666668 
Add 6 to the $LIST$ 
$LIST$ = $[ 56, 6 ]$
$N$ = 6 
$N$$/$$B$ = 6/5 = 1.2 
Add 2 to the$LIST$ 
$LIST$ = $[ 56, 6, 2 ]$
N = 2 
$N$$/$$C$ = 2/7 =0. 2857142857142857
Add 2 to the $LIST$.  
$LIST$ = $[ 56, 6, 2, 2 ]$
$N$  = 2
We have to keep repeating this process. If any of the numbers got by $N$ dividing by either $A$, $B$, $C$ have 0 after the decimal point then we have to take the first digit of the number. 
for example: if we got 12.005 then here we take 1 and add it to the list and then assign N = 1 
Now the queries ask for the elements at index 0, 1, 2, 3 of the $LIST$ which is 56,6, 2, 2

Indian National Olympiad in Informatics 2013
Calvin wakes up early one morning and finds that all his friends in the hostel are asleep. To amuse himself, he decides to play the following game : he draws a sequence of N squares on the ground, numbered 1 to N, and writes an integer in each square. He starts at square k (1 ≤ k ≤ N). The game consists of one forward phase followed by one backward phase.
- In the forward phase, Calvin makes zero or more moves of the following type : if his current position is p, he can jump to p+1 or p+2 as long as he stays within the N squares.
- In the backward phase, Calvin makes zero or more moves of the following type : if his current position is p, he can jump to p−1 or p−2 as long as he stays within the N squares.
He plays such that he finally ends up at square 1, and then he stops. He starts with a score of 0, and each time he jumps from square i to square j, he adds the integer written in square j to his score. Find the maximum score Calvin can obtain by playing this game. Recall that Calvin must start at square k and end at square 1. The integer on the square where he starts is not included in his score.
For example, suppose N = 5 and the numbers in squares are 5, 3, −2, 1, 1. If k = 2, Calvin starts on the second square. He can make a forward move to square 4, another to square 5, a backward move to square 4, another to square 2, and another to square 1. His total score is 1+1+1+3+5 = 11. You can check that this is the maximum score possible.

-----Input format-----
• Line 1 : Two space-separated integers, N and k, with 1 ≤ k ≤ N.
• Line 2 : A space-separated sequence of N integers, the numbers in squares 1, 2 . . . , N .

-----Output format-----
A single line with a single integer, the maximum score Calvin can obtain by playing the game.

-----Test Data-----
The testdata is grouped into two subtasks with the following constraints on the inputs.
• Subtask 1 [30 points] : 1 ≤ N ≤ 3000.
• Subtask 2 [70 points] : 1 ≤ N ≤ 106.
In all subtasks, the number in each square is between −1000 and 1000 inclusive.

-----Example-----
Here is the sample input and output corresponding to the example above.

The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv is going to the Birthday Party of  the Big Hippo tomorrow. Now he wants to prepare a gift for the Big Hippo.

He has N balloons, numbered from 1 to N. The i-th balloon has the color Ci and it costs Pi dollars. The gift for the Big Hippo will be any subset (chosen randomly, possibly empty) of the balloons such that the number of different colors in that subset is at least M.

Help Little Elephant to find the expected cost of the gift.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a pair of integers N and M. The next N lines contain N pairs of integers Ci and Pi, one pair per line.

-----Output-----
In T lines print T real numbers - the answers for the corresponding test cases. Your answer will considered correct if it has at most 10^-6 absolute or relative error.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
- 1 ≤ N,  Ci≤ 40
- 1 ≤ Pi ≤ 1000000
- 0 ≤ M ≤ K, where K is the number of different colors in the test case.

Doubleville, a small town in Texas, was attacked by the aliens. They have abducted some of the residents and taken them to the a spaceship orbiting around earth. After some (quite unpleasant) human experiments, the aliens cloned the victims, and released multiple copies of them back in Doubleville. So now it might happen that there are 6 identical person named Hugh F. Bumblebee: the original person and its 5 copies. The Federal Bureau of Unauthorized Cloning (FBUC) charged you with the task of determining how many copies were made from each person. To help you in your task, FBUC have collected a DNA sample from each person. All copies of the same person have the same DNA sequence, and different people have different sequences (we know that there are no identical twins in the town, this is not an issue).

-----Input-----

The input contains several blocks of test cases. Each case begins with a line containing two integers: the number 1 <= n <= 20000 people, and the length 1 <= m <= 20 of the DNA sequences. The next n lines contain the DNA sequences: each line contains a sequence of m characters, where each character is either 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'.

The input is terminated by a block with n = m = 0 .

-----Output-----
For each test case, you have to output n lines, each line containing a single integer. The first line contains the number of different people that were not copied. The second line contains the number of people that were copied only once (i.e., there are two identical copies for each such person.) The third line contains the number of people that are present in three identical copies, and so on: the i -th line contains the number of persons that are present in i identical copies. For example, if there are 11 samples, one of them is from John Smith, and all the others are from copies of Joe Foobar, then you have to print '1' in the first and the tenth lines, and '0' in all the other lines.

Little Egor is a huge movie fan. He likes watching different kinds of movies: from drama movies to comedy movies, from teen movies to horror movies. He is planning to visit cinema this weekend, but he's not sure which movie he should watch.
There are n movies to watch during this weekend. Each movie can be characterized by two integers Li and Ri, denoting the length and the rating of the corresponding movie. Egor wants to watch exactly one movie with the maximal value of Li × Ri. If there are several such movies, he would pick a one with the maximal Ri among them. If there is still a tie, he would pick the one with the minimal index among them.
Your task is to help Egor to pick a movie to watch during this weekend.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of the test case description contains an integer n.
The second line of the test case description contains n integers L1, L2, ...,Ln. The following line contains n integers R1, R2, ..., Rn.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single integer i denoting the index of the movie that Egor should watch during this weekend. Note that we follow 1-based indexing.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 5
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ 100

-----Explanation-----
In the first example case, both films have the same value of L × R, but the first film has a better rating.
In the second example case, the second and the fourth movies are equally good, but the second movie has a smaller index.

Dhiraj loves Chocolates.He loves chocolates so much that he can eat up to $1000$ chocolates a day. But his mom is fed up by this habit of him and decides to take things in her hand.
Its diwali Season and Dhiraj has got a lot of boxes of chocolates and Dhiraj's mom is afraid that dhiraj might eat all boxes of chocolates.
So she told Dhiraj that he can eat only exactly $k$ number of chocolates and dhiraj has to finish all the chocolates in box selected by him and then move on to next box of chocolate.Now Dhiraj is confused that whether he will be able to eat $k$ number of chocolates or not. Since dhiraj is weak at maths,he asks for your help to tell him whether he can eat $k$ number of chocolates or not. 
So given number of chocolates  are $k$ which dhiraj has to eat and the boxes of chocolates each containing some number of chocolates, tell whether dhiraj will be able to eat $k$ number of chocolates or not.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- $k$, representing the number of chocolates dhiraj has to eat.
- the third line contains $N$ representing the no. of boxes of chocolates.
- fourth line contains list of $a[]$ size $N$ specifying the number of chocolates in each Box.

-----Output:-----
- For each testcase, output in a single line answer $0$ or $1$.
- $0$ if dhiraj cant eat $k$ chocolates from given combination and $1$ if he can eat $k$ chocolates from given combination.

	The following graph G is called a Petersen graph and its vertices have been numbered from 0 to 9. Some letters have also been assigned to vertices of G, as can be seen from the following picture:

	Let's consider a walk W in graph G, which consists of L vertices W1, W2, ..., WL, such that Wi is connected with Wi + 1 for 1 ≤ i < L. A string S of L letters 'A'-'E' is realized by walk W if the sequence of letters written along W is equal to S. Vertices can be visited multiple times while walking along W.

For example, S = 'ABBECCD' is realized by W = (0, 1, 6, 9, 7, 2, 3).
Your task is to determine whether there is a walk W which realizes a given string S in graph G, and if so, find the lexicographically least such walk.

-----Input-----

	The first line of the input contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases to process.

	The only line of each testcase contains one string S. It is guaranteed that S only consists of symbols 'A'-'E'.

-----Output-----

	The output should contain exactly T lines, one line per each testcase in the order of their appearance. For each testcase, if there is no walk W which realizes S, then output -1. Otherwise, you should output the least lexicographical walk W which realizes S. Since all of the vertices are numbered from 0 to 9, then it can be encoded as a string consisting of symbols '0'-'9' (see the ""Examples"" section for more details).

Vanja and Miksi really like games. After playing one game for a long time, they decided to invent another game!
In this game, they have a sequence $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$ and two numbers $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. The rules of the game are as follows:
- The players take turns alternately, starting with Vanja.
- There is an integer $S$; at the beginning, $S = 0$.
- In each turn, the current player must choose an arbitrary element of $A$ and either add that number to $S$ or subtract it from $S$. Each element can be selected multiple times.
- Afterwards, if $S = Z_1$ or $S = Z_2$, the current player (the player who made $S$ equal to $Z_1$ or $Z_2$) is the winner of the game.
- If the game lasts for $10^{10}$ turns, Vanja and Miksi decide to declare it a tie.
Can you help the boys determine the winner of the game? Please note that the game can end in a tie (if nobody can make $S = Z_1$ or $S = Z_2$ in the first $10^{10}$ moves).
Both players play optimally, i.e. if there is a move which guarantees the current player's victory regardless of the other player's moves, the current player will make such a move. If the current player cannot win and there is a move which guarantees that the game will end in a tie, the current player will make such a move.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$.

-----Output-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the final result of the game:
- $1$ if Vanja (the first player) has a winning strategy
- $2$ if Miksi (the second player) has a winning strategy
- $0$ if the game ends in a tie

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 50$
- $1 \le N \le 50$
- $|Z_1|, |Z_2| \le 10^9$
- $|A_i| \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$

Example case 2: It can be proven that neither player is able to reach $S = Z_1$ or $S = Z_2$. The result is a tie.

Rachel has some candies and she decided to distribute them among $N$ kids. The ith kid receives $A_i$ candies. The kids are happy iff the difference between the highest and lowest number of candies received is less than $X$.
Find out if the children are happy or not.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line contains $N$ and $X$. 
- The second line contains $N$ integers $A_1,A_2,...,A_N$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case print either ""YES""(without quotes) if the kids are happy else ""NO""(without quotes)

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N, X \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 10^5$

As we all know, Chef is cooking string for long days, his new discovery on string is the longest common pattern length. The longest common pattern length between two strings is the maximum number of characters that both strings have in common. Characters are case sensitive, that is, lower case and upper case characters are considered as different. Note that characters can repeat in a string and a character might have one or more occurrence in common between two strings. For example, if Chef has two strings A = ""Codechef"" and B = ""elfedcc"", then the longest common pattern length of A and B is 5 (common characters are c, d, e, e, f).
Chef wants to test you with the problem described above. He will give you two strings of Latin alphabets and digits, return him the longest common pattern length.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then the description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a string A. The next line contains another character string B.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer, the longest common pattern length between A and B.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ |A|, |B| ≤ 10000 (104), where |S| denotes the length of the string S
- Both of A and B can contain only alphabet characters (both lower and upper case) and digits

-----Example-----
Input:

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. There is no common character.
Example case 2. All the characters are same.
Example case 3. Three characters (a, a and c) are same.
Example case 4. This sample is mentioned by the statement.

Zonal Computing Olympiad 2012, 26 Nov 2011

It's dinner time in Castle Camelot, and the fearsome Knights of the Round Table are clamouring for dessert. You, the chef, are in a soup.  There are N knights, including King Arthur, each with a different preference for dessert, but you cannot afford to make desserts for all of them.

You are given the cost of manufacturing each Knight's preferred dessert–since it is a round table, the list starts with the cost of King Arthur's dessert, and goes counter-clockwise.

You decide to pick the cheapest desserts to make, such that for every pair of adjacent Knights, at least one gets his dessert. This will ensure that the Knights do not protest.<p>A strange feature of the Knights is that they will not complain about not getting dessert unless they get support from both their neighbours.  So, you decide to pick the cheapest desserts to make, such that for every pair of adjacent Knights, at least one gets his dessert.</p>

What is the minimum cost of tonight's dinner, given this condition?

For instance, suppose there are 5 Knights and their desserts cost 1, 2, 1, 2 and 2.  In this case, the minimum cost is 4, which you can achieve by feeding the first, third and fourth (or fifth) Knights.  

-----Input format-----
There are 2 lines of input.  The first line contains a single integer N, the number of seats at the table. The next line contains N space separated integers, each being the cost of the dessert of a Knight, listed in counterclockwise order around the table, starting with King Arthur.

-----Output format-----
The output should be a single line containing a single integer, the minimum possible cost for you, the chef.

-----Testdata-----
Each Knight's dessert costs strictly more than 0 and strictly less than 1000.  You may assume that 1 ≤ N ≤ 106.  In 30% of the test cases, 1 ≤ N ≤ 103.

Note : This question carries $150$ $points$
There is an outcry in Middle Earth, as the greatest war between Orgs of Dark Lord Sauron and Frodo Baggins is about to begin. To end the war, Frodo decides to destroy the ring in the volcano of Mordor. There are many ships that lead Frodo to Mordor, and he is confused about which one he should board.  Given two-ship numbers $M$ and $N$, Frodo has to solve a problem to find the ship which he should board.
Find the number of pairs (x, y), such that $1<=x<=M$ and $1<=y<=N$, for which $x*y + x+ y = string(x)+string(y)$ is true. 
Also, calculate the number of distinct x satisfying the given condition.  The number of pairs and the number of distinct x will help select Frodo the boat he should board. Help Frodo defeat Sauron. 

-----Input :-----
- First line contains $T$ as number of test cases 
- Each test case contains two integers $M$ and $N$ 

-----Output :-----
- For each test case, print two integers - the number of such pairs (x,y) and the number of distinct x

Chef wants to teach a lesson of sharing to the students.
There are $N$ students (numbered from $1$ to $N$ from left to right) who are asked to stand in a row. Initially Chef gave $A$$i$ candies to the $i$$th$ child. In one operation any child can give any number of candies to the child standing to his immediate left (i.e. $i$$th$ child can give any amount of candies to the $(i-1)$$th$ child. In particular 1st child cannot give his candies to anyone).  
He asked them to minimize the maximum value of candies a student can possess after performing any number of operations (possibly zero). 
Help the students finding such maximum value.

-----Input:-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- First line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of students.
- Second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A$$1$,$A$$2$,$.....$ $A$$N$ denoting the initial amount of candies chef gave to them.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― maximum value after sharing.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $0$ $\leq$ $A$$i$ $\leq$ $10^9$
- Sum of $N$ over all Test Cases does not exceed $10^5$

For First Test Case:
The $5$$th$ student will give $2$ candies to $4$$th$ student and $4$$th$ will give $3$ candies to $3$$rd$ and $3$$rd$ will give $3$ candies to $2$$nd$ and $2$$nd$ will give $2$ candies to $1$$st$. So finally the number of candies that they will have are 
$[3,3,3,3,3]$ and the value of maximum candies is $3$.
- 
For Second Test Case:
Sharing to the left student will not change the maximum value as $1$$st$ cannot share to anyone. So the maximum value will remain $5$.

Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum are playing a fierce match of binary Nim. This novel game is played with $N$ stacks, each of them containing only $1$-s and $0$-s.
Just like in normal Nim, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum alternate turns; in their turn, a player must choose one non-empty stack and remove a positive number of elements from the top of this stack. However, Tweedle-Dee may only choose a stack with $0$ at the top (and remove elements from it afterwards), and similarly, Tweedle-Dum may only choose a stack with $1$ at the top. the player that cannot make a move loses
Suzumo does not want to wait for the end of the game, so given the starting player he asks you to determine the winner. Remember that Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum are legendary grandmasters of combinatorial games, so both always play optimally.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer $N$, a string $S$ denoting the number of stacks, the player that starts the game, respectively.
- Each of the following $N$ lines contains a single binary string $B$ representing a stack; the first character of $B$ corresponds to the top element of the stack and the last character to the bottom element.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string ""Dee"" if Tweedle-Dee wins the match or ""Dum"" if Tweedle-Dum wins.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 500$
- $1 \le N \le 50$
- $1 \le |B| \le 50$
- each character in $B$ is either '1' or '0'

Chef loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Let F(X) equals to the number of lucky digits in decimal representation of X. Chef wants to know the number of such integers X, that L ≤ X ≤ R and F(X) is a lucky number. Help him and calculate that number modulo 109+7.

-----Input-----
First line contains one integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains two space separated positive integers L and R.

-----Output-----
For each of the T test cases print one integer, the number of such X, that L ≤ X ≤ R and F(X) is a lucky number, modulo 1000000007.

-----Notes-----
First test case: of course, any number of less than 4 digits can't contain lucky number of lucky digits, so the answer is 0.

Second test case: 16 required numbers are 4444 4447 4474 4477 4744 4747 4774 4777 7444 7447 7474 7477 7744 7747 7774 7777.

Third test case: there are 640 required lucky numbers. Some of them are 4474, 14747, 41474, 77277, 44407, 74749.

Fourth test case: the only two required numbers are 4444 and 4447.

You are given $N$ integers in an array: $A[1], A[2], \ldots, A[N]$. You also have another integer $L$.
Consider a sequence of indices ($i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k$). Note that a particular index can occur multiple times in the sequence, and there is no order in which these indices have to occur. ($i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k$) is a sequence of size $k$. It is said to be an $Interesting$ sequence, if $A[i_1] \ge A[i_2] \ge \ldots \ge A[i_k]$.
The $Cost$ of an Interesting sequence ($i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k$), is defined to be the minimum absolute difference between any two adjacent indices. In other words, the Cost is $min \{ |i_2 - i_1|, |i_3 - i_2|, \ldots, |i_k - i_{k-1}| \}$.
Your job is to consider the Costs of all the Interesting sequences of size $L$ associated with the given array, and output the maximum Cost. Note that you can show that there is always at least one Interesting sequence for the given constraints.

-----Input-----
- The first line contains a single integer, $T$, which is the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows.
- The first line of each testcase contains two space separated integers: $N$ and $L$.
- The second line of each testcase contains $N$ space separated integers: $A[1], A[2], \ldots, A[N]$.

-----Output-----
- For each testcase, output the answer in a new line.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 3$
- $1 \leq A[i] \leq 10^9$
- $2 \leq L \leq 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1: 7 points
- It is guaranteed that $A[1] > A[2] > \ldots > A[N]$
- Note that the above condition implies that all elements are distinct.
- $1 \leq N \leq 500$
- Subtask 2: 7 points
- It is guaranteed that $A[1] \ge A[2] \ge \ldots \ge A[N]$
- $1 \leq N \leq 500$
- Subtask 3: 14 points

-----Explanation-----
We are looking for Interesting sequences of length 3. Some of them are:
- (4, 2, 3): This is Interesting because $A[4] \ge A[2] \ge A[3]$. Its cost is $min \{ |2-4|, |3-2|\} = 1$.
- (5, 1, 1): Cost is 0.
- (2, 2, 2): Cost is 0.
- (6, 1, 3): Cost is 2.
- (6, 2, 5): Cost is 3.

Tired of the overpopulated world, Miu - The introverted cat visits a new continent in search for a new house.  
There are $N$ houses lying on the X-axis.

Their positions are given by $X$$i$ , where $i$ refers to the $i$th house. ( $1 <= i <= N$ )

Each of these positions are pairwise distinct 
Miu is supposed to choose one of these houses for herself.

Miu defines a term - The Distance of Peace,  as the minimum distance from her house to any other house.  
Miu wonders what is maximum Distance of Peace she can obtain. Can you help her?

Since due to COVID 19, India has undergone a complete 21 day lockdown. So Amol was attending an online lecture where his professor asked him to solve a question. Amol was unable to solve the question so he asked you to solve the question and give him the correct answer. 

The question was asked a such that his professor gave him a number M and a list of integers of length N (i.e. A1, A2,..... AN) and you have to find out all the subsets that add up to M and the total number of subsets will be the final answer. 

Input: 
• The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

• The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. 

• The second line of each test case contains a single integer M. 

• The third line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2,..... AN. 

Output: 
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the no. of subsets that adds upto M.

You might have heard about our new goodie distribution program aka the ""Laddu Accrual System"". This problem is designed to give you a glimpse of its rules. You can read the page once before attempting the problem if you wish, nonetheless we will be providing all the information needed here itself. 

Laddu Accrual System is our new goodie distribution program. In this program, we will be distributing Laddus in place of goodies for your winnings and various other activities (described below), that you perform on our system. Once you collect enough number of Laddus, you can then redeem them to get yourself anything from a wide range of CodeChef goodies.  

Let us know about various activities and amount of laddus you get corresponding to them.

- Contest Win (CodeChef’s Long, Cook-Off, LTIME, or any contest hosted with us) : 300 + Bonus (Bonus = 20 - contest rank). Note that if your rank is > 20, then you won't get any bonus.
- Top Contributor on Discuss : 300
- Bug Finder	: 50 - 1000 (depending on the bug severity). It may also fetch you a CodeChef internship! 
- Contest Hosting	 : 50 

You can do a checkout for redeeming laddus once a month. The minimum laddus redeemable at Check Out are 200 for Indians and 400 for the rest of the world.

You are given history of various activities of a user. The user has not redeemed any of the its laddus accrued.. Now the user just wants to redeem as less amount of laddus he/she can, so that the laddus can last for as long as possible. Find out for how many maximum number of months he can redeem the laddus.

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases
- For each test case:

- First line contains an integer followed by a string denoting activities, origin respectively, where activities denotes number of activities of the user, origin denotes whether the user is Indian or the rest of the world. origin can be ""INDIAN"" or ""NON_INDIAN"".
- For each of the next activities lines, each line contains an activity. 

			An activity can be of four types as defined above. 

- Contest Win : Input will be of form of CONTEST_WON rank, where rank denotes the rank of the user. 
- Top Contributor : Input will be of form of TOP_CONTRIBUTOR.
- Bug Finder : Input will be of form of BUG_FOUND severity, where severity denotes the severity of the bug. 
- Contest Hosting : Input will be of form of CONTEST_HOSTED.

-----Output-----
- For each test case, find out the maximum number of months for which the user can redeem the laddus accrued.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T, activities ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ rank ≤ 5000
- 50 ≤ severity ≤ 1000

-----Subtasks-----
There is only a single subtask with 100 points.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4 INDIAN
CONTEST_WON 1
TOP_CONTRIBUTOR
BUG_FOUND 100
CONTEST_HOSTED
4 NON_INDIAN
CONTEST_WON 1
TOP_CONTRIBUTOR
BUG_FOUND 100
CONTEST_HOSTED

Output:
3
1

-----Explanation-----
In the first example, 

- For winning contest with rank 1, user gets 300 + 20 - 1 = 319 laddus. 
- For top contributor, user gets 300 laddus. 
- For finding a bug with severity of 100, user gets 100 laddus. 
- For hosting a contest, user gets 50 laddus. 

So, overall user gets 319 + 300 + 100 + 50 = 769 laddus.
Now, the user is an Indian user, he can redeem only 200 laddus per month. So, for first three months, he will redeem 200 * 3 = 600 laddus. The remaining 169 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 200 laddues in a month to redeem. 

So, answer is 3.

In the second example, user is a non-Indian user, he can redeem 400 laddues per month. So, in the first month, he will redeem 400 laddus. The remaining 369 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 400 laddues in a month to redeem. 

So, answer is 1.

Mr. Pr and Ms. Ad are at $a$ and $b$ respectively on an infinite number line. Mr. Pr wants to meet Ms. Ad.
Mr. Pr can choose to move  $c$ or $d$ units in 1 second. If Mr. Pr moves $c$ units then Ms. Ad will move $d$ units and vice versa. (Both of them always moved in positive x-direction)
You have to determine if Mr. Pr can meet with Ms. Ad after some integral amount of time, given that Mr. Pr chooses optimally. Note that meeting after a fractional amount of time does not count.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains four space separated integers, $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, output a single line containing ""YES"" if Mr. Pr meets with Ms. Ad, otherwise ""NO"".

Back in 2015, Usain Bolt announced that he'll be retiring after the 2017 World Championship. Though his final season did not end gloriously, we all know that he is a true legend and we witnessed his peak during 2008 - 2013. 
Post retirement, Usain Bolt is still leading an adventurous life. He's exploring the unexplored parts of the globe. But sometimes he gets bored, and reads questions asked about him on Quora. One such question he read was, ""Who would win a race between Usain Bolt and a tiger if the race is on a straight line track and the tiger is $distancetoBolt$ meters behind Bolt? The finishing point is $finish$ meters away from Bolt's starting position. The tiger starts with an initial speed of $0$ $meter/second$, and will accelerate itself with $tigerAccelaration$ $m/s^2$. Bolt can run with a constant speed of $boltSpeed$ $m/s$ from start to finish. Given these values, find out who will win the race - Bolt or the tiger? ""
Note that Bolt will win the race if and only if he touches the finishing line before the tiger touches it. If both of them finish together, the tiger is announced as the winner since Bolt was given an initial advantage. See the figure below for more clarity.

Since Bolt was busy practicing in the tracks during his Physics school classes, he is asking for your help to solve the question. Can you please help him?
He just remembers two formulae from the class, and thinks that they will be useful to you:
$Displacement (S) $ = $ut$ +$ (1/2)at^2$ where $u$ is the initial velocity , #$ $is the acceleration and $t$ is the time taken.
$Velocity$ = $Displacement /Time$

-----Input:-----
- The first line will contain $T$, the number of testcases. Then the description of each test case follow. 
- Each test case contains 4 integers $finish, distancetoBolt, tigerAccelaration, boltSpeed$. 

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line, the word ""Bolt"" or ""Tiger"" without quotes, depending on whether Bolt wins or the tiger wins.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100000$
- $1 \leq finish\leq 10^5$

Chef recently started working at ABC corporation. Let's number weekdays (Monday through Friday) by integers $1$ through $5$. For each valid $i$, the number of hours Chef spent working at the office on weekday $i$ was $A_i$.
Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Chef started working from home and his productivity decreased by a considerable amount. As per Chef's analysis, $1$ hour of work done at the office is equivalent to $P$ hours of work done at home.
Now, in order to complete his work properly, Chef has to spend more hours working from home, possibly at the cost of other things like sleep. However, he does not have to do the same work on each day as he would have in the office ― for each weekday, he can start the work for this day on an earlier day and/or complete it on a later day. The only requirement is that his work does not pile up indefinitely, i.e. he can complete his work for each week during the same week. One day has $24$ hours.
If Chef is unable to complete his work for a week during those five weekdays, then he has to work during the weekend too. Chef wishes to know whether he has to work on weekends or if he can complete his work by working only on weekdays. Help him answer that question. (It is possible that Chef would be unable to finish his work even if he worked all the time, but he does not want to know about that.)

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, $A_4$, $A_5$ and $P$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string ""Yes"" if Chef has to work on weekends or ""No"" otherwise (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $0 \le A_i \le 24$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le P \le 24$

-----Subtasks-----

-----Example Input-----

14 10 12 6 18 2
10 10 10 10 10 3

-----Example Output-----
No
Yes

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: Here, $P=2$, so the number of hours Chef has to work from home to handle his workload for days $1$ through $5$ is $[28,20,24,12,36]$. If he works for full $24$ hours on each of the five weekdays, he finishes all the work, so he does not have to work on weekends.

Chef bought a huge (effectively infinite) planar island and built $N$ restaurants (numbered $1$ through $N$) on it. For each valid $i$, the Cartesian coordinates of restaurant $i$ are $(X_i, Y_i)$.
Now, Chef wants to build $N-1$ straight narrow roads (line segments) on the island. The roads may have arbitrary lengths; restaurants do not have to lie on the roads. The slope of each road must be $1$ or $-1$, i.e. for any two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ on the same road, $|x_1-x_2| = |y_1-y_2|$ must hold.
Let's denote the minimum distance Chef has to walk from restaurant $i$ to reach a road by $D_i$. Then, let's denote $a = \mathrm{max}\,(D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_N)$; Chef wants this distance to be minimum possible.
Chef is a busy person, so he decided to give you the job of building the roads. You should find a way to build them that minimises $a$ and compute $a \cdot \sqrt{2}$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $X_i$ and $Y_i$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one real number — the minimum distance $a$ multiplied by $\sqrt{2}$. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-6}$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $2 \le N \le 10^4$
- $|X_i|, |Y_i| \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$

and Bengali as well.
There are N$N$ cats (numbered 1$1$ through N$N$) and M$M$ rats (numbered 1$1$ through M$M$) on a line. Each cat and each rat wants to move from some point to some (possibly the same) point on this line. Naturally, the cats also want to eat the rats when they get a chance. Both the cats and the rats can only move with constant speed 1$1$.
For each valid i$i$, the i$i$-th cat is initially sleeping at a point a_i$a_i$. At a time s_i$s_i$, this cat wakes up and starts moving to a final point b_i$b_i$ with constant velocity and without any detours (so it arrives at this point at the time e_i = s_i + |a_i-b_i|$e_i = s_i + |a_i-b_i|$). After it arrives at the point b_i$b_i$, it falls asleep again.
For each valid i$i$, the i$i$-th rat is initially hiding at a point c_i$c_i$. At a time r_i$r_i$, this rat stops hiding and starts moving to a final point d_i$d_i$ in the same way as the cats ― with constant velocity and without any detours, arriving at the time q_i = r_i + |c_i-d_i|$q_i = r_i + |c_i-d_i|$ (if it does not get eaten). After it arrives at the point d_i$d_i$, it hides again.
If a cat and a rat meet each other (they are located at the same point at the same time), the cat eats the rat, the rat disappears and cannot be eaten by any other cat. A sleeping cat cannot eat a rat and a hidden rat cannot be eaten ― formally, cat i$i$ can eat rat j$j$ only if they meet at a time t$t$ satisfying s_i \le t \le e_i$s_i \le t \le e_i$ and r_j \le t \le q_j$r_j \le t \le q_j$.
Your task is to find out which rats get eaten by which cats. It is guaranteed that no two cats will meet a rat at the same time.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N$N$ and M$M$.
- N$N$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1 \le i \le N$1 \le i \le N$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers a_i$a_i$, b_i$b_i$ and s_i$s_i$.
- M$M$ more lines follow. For each i$i$ (1 \le i \le M$1 \le i \le M$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers c_i$c_i$, d_i$d_i$ and r_i$r_i$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print M$M$ lines. For each valid i$i$, the i$i$-th of these lines should contain a single integer ― the number of the cat that will eat the i$i$-th rat, or -1$-1$ if no cat will eat this rat.

Let's define the niceness of a sequence of positive integers X1,X2,…,XN$X_1, X_2, \dots, X_N$ as the sum of greatest common divisors of all pairs of its elements, i.e.
N∑i=1N∑j=i+1gcd(Xi,Xj).∑i=1N∑j=i+1Ngcd(Xi,Xj).\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=i+1}^N \mathrm{gcd}(X_i, X_j)\;.
For example, the niceness of the sequence [1,2,2]$[1, 2, 2]$ is gcd(1,2)+gcd(1,2)+gcd(2,2)=4$gcd(1, 2) + gcd(1, 2) + gcd(2, 2) = 4$.
You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,AN$A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$; each of its elements is either a positive integer or missing.
Consider all possible ways to replace each missing element of A$A$ by a positive integer (not necessarily the same for each element) such that the sum of all elements is equal to S$S$. Your task is to find the total niceness of all resulting sequences, i.e. compute the niceness of each possible resulting sequence and sum up all these values. Since the answer may be very large, compute it modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N$N$ and S$S$. 
- The second line contains N$N$ space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN$A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$. Missing elements in this sequence are denoted by −1$-1$.

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the total niceness modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$.

The faculty of application management and consulting services (FAMCS) of the Berland State University (BSU) has always been popular among Berland's enrollees. This year, N students attended the entrance exams, but no more than K will enter the university. In order to decide who are these students, there are series of entrance exams. All the students with score strictly greater than at least (N-K) students' total score gets enrolled.
In total there are E entrance exams, in each of them one can score between 0 and M points, inclusively. The first E-1 exams had already been conducted, and now it's time for the last tribulation.
Sergey is the student who wants very hard to enter the university, so he had collected the information about the first E-1 from all N-1 enrollees (i.e., everyone except him). Of course, he knows his own scores as well.
In order to estimate his chances to enter the University after the last exam, Sergey went to a fortune teller. From the visit, he learnt about scores that everyone except him will get at the last exam. Now he wants to calculate the minimum score he needs to score in order to enter to the university. But now he's still very busy with minimizing the amount of change he gets in the shops, so he asks you to help him.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four space separated integers N, K, E, M denoting the number of students, the maximal number of students who'll get enrolled, the total number of entrance exams and maximal number of points for a single exam, respectively.
The following N-1 lines will contain E integers each, where the first E-1 integers correspond to the scores of the exams conducted. The last integer corresponds to the score at the last exam, that was predicted by the fortune-teller.
The last line contains E-1 integers denoting Sergey's score for the first E-1 exams.

-----Output-----

For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum score Sergey should get in the last exam in order to be enrolled. If Sergey doesn't have a chance to be enrolled, output ""Impossible"" (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 5
- 1 ≤ K < N ≤ 104
- 1 ≤ M ≤ 109
- 1 ≤ E ≤ 4

-----Example-----
Input:1
4 2 3 10
7 7 7
4 6 10
7 10 9
9 9

Output:4

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. If Sergey gets 4 points at the last exam, his score will be equal to 9+9+4=22. This will be the second score among all the enrollees - the first one will get 21, the second one will get 20 and the third will have the total of 26. Thus, Sergey will enter the university.

Zonal Computing Olympiad 2012, 26 Nov 2011

The year is 2102 and today is the day of ZCO. This year there are N contests and the starting and ending times of each contest is known to you. You have to participate in exactly one of these contests. Different contests may overlap. The duration of different contests might be different. 

There is only one examination centre. There is a wormhole V that transports you from your house to the examination centre and another wormhole W that transports you from the examination centre back to your house. Obviously, transportation through a wormhole does not take any time; it is instantaneous. But the wormholes can be used at only certain fixed times, and these are known to you.

So, you use a V wormhole to reach the exam centre, possibly wait for some time before the next contest begins, take part in the contest, possibly wait for some more time and then use a W wormhole to return back home. If you leave through a V wormhole at time t1 and come back through a W wormhole at time t2, then the total time you have spent is (t2 - t1 + 1). Your aim is to spend as little time as possible overall while ensuring
that you take part in one of the contests.

You can reach the centre exactly at the starting time of the contest, if possible. And you can leave the examination centre the very second the contest ends, if possible. You can assume that you will always be able to attend at least one contest–that is, there will always be a contest such that there is a V wormhole before it and a W wormhole after it.

For instance, suppose there are 3 contests with (start,end) times (15,21), (5,10), and (7,25), respectively.  Suppose the V wormhole is available at times 4, 14, 25, 2 and the W wormhole is available at times 13 and 21.  In this case, you can leave by the V wormhole at time 14, take part in the contest from time 15 to 21, and then use the W wormhole at time 21 to get back home.  Therefore the time you have spent is (21 - 14 + 1) = 8. You can check that you cannot do better than this.

-----Input format-----
The first line contains 3 space separated integers N, X, and Y, where N is the number of contests, X is the number of time instances when wormhole V can be used and Y is the number of time instances when wormhole W can be used.  The next N lines describe each contest.  Each of these N lines contains two space separated integers S and E, where S is the starting time of the particular contest and E is the ending time of that contest, with S < E.  The next line contains X space separated integers which are the time instances when the wormhole V can be used.  The next line contains Y space separated integers which are the time instances when the wormhole W can be used.

-----Output format-----
Print a single line that contains a single integer, the minimum time needed to be spent to take part in a contest.

-----Testdata-----
All the starting and ending times of contests are distinct and no contest starts at the same time as another contest ends. The time instances when wormholes are available are all distinct, but may coincide with starting and ending times of contests. All the time instances (the contest timings and the wormhole timings) will be integers between 1 and 1000000 (inclusive).

- Subtask 1 (30 marks)
- Subtask 2 (70 marks)

You may assume that 
1 ≤ N ≤ 105,
1 ≤ X ≤ 105, and
1 ≤ Y ≤ 105.

In 30% of the cases, 
1 ≤ N ≤ 103,
1 ≤ X ≤ 103, and
1 ≤ Y ≤ 103.

A long way back I have taken $5000 from Golu when I used to live in Jodhpur. Now, time has passed and I am out of Jodhpur. While Golu still in Jodhpur, one day called me and asked about his money.
I thought of giving Golu a chance. I told him that he can still take his money back if he reaches my home anyhow just in 2 days but not after that. 
In excitement he made his way toward my hometown i.e. Gorakhpur. To cover up the petrol cost he started giving paid lift to whoever needs it throughout the way in order to earn some money. Help him to get the maximum profit.

His car has a capacity of k + 1 person, so in a certain moment he can transport k persons (and himself). 
From Jodhpur to Gorakhpur, there are l localities (cities, towns, villages), Jodhpur being the first and Gorakhpur being the lth.
There are n groups of lift takers along the road. The ith
group consists of pi persons, wants to travel from locality si  to locality di and will pay an amount of mi money.
A group must be taken into the car as a whole. Assume that lift takers are found only in localities.

Restrictions
• 1 ≤ k ≤ 7
• 1 ≤ l ≤ 1000000
• 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
• 1 ≤ pi ≤ k
• 1 ≤ si ≤ l – 1
• 2 ≤ di ≤ l
• si < di
• 1 ≤ mi ≤ 1000000

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains the numbers n, l and k separated by a single space.
n lines follow, the ith line containing pi, si, di and mi separated by a single space.

-----Output-----
For each test case output a single line containing the maximum amount of money Golu can earn.

There were $N$ students (numbered $1$ through $N$) participating in the Indian Programming Camp (IPC) and they watched a total of $K$ lectures (numbered $1$ through $K$). For each student $i$ and each lecture $j$, the $i$-th student watched the $j$-th lecture for $T_{i, j}$ minutes.
Additionally, for each student $i$, we know that this student asked the question, ""What is the criteria for getting a certificate?"" $Q_i$ times.
The criteria for getting a certificate is that a student must have watched at least $M$ minutes of lectures in total and they must have asked the question no more than $10$ times.
Find out how many participants are eligible for a certificate.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers $N$, $M$ and $K$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains $K+1$ space-separated integers $T_{i, 1}, T_{i, 2}, \ldots, T_{i, K}, Q_i$.

-----Output-----
Print a single line containing one integer — the number of participants eligible for a certificate. 

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le N, K \le 1,000$
- $1 \le M \le 10^6$
- $1 \le Q_i \le 10^6$ for each valid $i$

-----Explanation-----
- Participant $1$ watched $1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6$ minutes of lectures and asked the question $5$ times. Since $6 < M$, this participant does not receive a certificate.
- Participant $2$ watched $3 + 5 + 1 + 3 = 12$ minutes of lectures and asked the question $4$ times. Since $12 \ge M$ and $4 \le 10$, this participant receives a certificate.
- Participant $3$ watched $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12$ minutes of lectures and asked the question $11$ times. Since $12 \ge M$ but $11 > 10$, this participant does not receive a certificate.
- Participant $4$ watched $1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6$ minutes of lectures and asked the question $12$ times. Since $6 < M$ and $12 > 10$, this participant does not receive a certificate.

Chef is stuck on the minute hand of a giant clock. To escape from this clock he needs to get onto the hour hand which has an exit door. 
Since the minute hand and and hour hand are not connected at any point, chef will surely need to make a jump. Since he wants minimum risks, he chooses to jump on the hour hand so that the angle he has to cover is minimum possible.
You will be given a clock time in $UTC$ format denoting time of chef's jump and you have to compute the minimum angle that chef needs to cover while completing the jump.
For some reason chef times his jump only when the number of minutes is a multiple of 5.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of  $T$ test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a string denoting time in UTC format (e.g. 10:20 i.e. 10 hours and 20 minutes)

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line denoting the smallest angle of jump.

- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $0 \leq hours \leq 23$
- $0 \leq minutes \leq 59$

-----Example Input-----
3
14:20
02:10
09:30

-----Example Output-----
50 degree 
5 degree  
105 degree

-----Explanation-----
- In the second case, once the hour hand reaches 2 it starts moving towards 3 with the passing of every minute, hence when the minute hand points 10 minutes, the hour hand has already covered some angle towards 3. 
In this scenario the two angles made by hour and minute hand are 355 and 5 degrees. Since chef will jump on the side with minimum angle, he chooses the one with 5-degree angle.

Lumpy is a bus driver. Today, the conductor is absent so Lumpy has to do the conductor's job as well. There are N creatures in the bus. Sometimes the creatures don't carry change and can't pay the exact amount of the fare. Each creature in the bus today has paid an amount
greater than his/her fare. You are given information about the extra amount paid by each creature, by an array A of size N, where Ai denotes the extra amount paid by the i-th creature, in rupees.
After the end of the trip, Lumpy noticed that he had P one rupee coins and Q two rupee coins. He wants to pay back the creatures using this money. Being a kind hearted moose, Lumpy wants to pay back as many creatures as he can. Note that Lumpy will 
not pay back the i-th creature if he can't pay the exact amount that the i-th creature requires with the coins that he possesses. 
Lumpy is busy driving the bus and doesn't want to calculate the maximum number of creatures he can satisfy - He will surely cause an accident if he tries to do so. Can you help him out with this task? 

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- For each test case, first line consists of three space separated integers N, P and Q.
- Second line consists of N space separated integers A containing N space integers, where i-th integer denotes Ai.

-----Output-----
- For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to maximum number of creatures that Lumpy can pay back.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 106
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
- 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
- 0 ≤ P, Q ≤ 1014
- Sum of N over all the cases does not exceed 106

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. Lumpy has just 3 one rupee coins. 

He can pay creatures numbered {1, 2} or creatures numbered {1, 3} with these coins. Thus, answer is 2. 
Example 2. Lumpy has 2 one rupee coins and 1 two rupee coin. 

In the optimal solution, Lumpy can give the two rupee coin to creature 2 and the one rupee coins to creatures 1 and 3. Thus, answer is 3.

Shivam is working on electric circuits. He requires some connecting wires. He needs to make a total of N connections and he has mentioned his wire length requirements for each connection in an integer sequence A. For buying wires, he need to decide the length of each wire piece, and he’ll get as many wire pieces of the chosen length each at unit cost (cost 1 per piece) but he can't get wires of different lengths. Also, he can't cut wire pieces to make new pieces of different (smaller) length(s).
But he can connect any number of wires together to form a new single wire piece whose length is the sum of lengths of the wires connected. So, Shivam needs to choose an integer length for buying wires. Shivam hates to waste anything, and he hates it even more if that thing is money.
Shivam is weak in mathematics and is asking you to help him in this situation. Help him decide the length of wires and total number of wires so as to minimize the total expenditure.
Note: You cannot make a connection which requires a wire piece of length X with a wire piece of length Y if X≠Y.

Output:
For each test case print a single line containing two space separated integers, length of each wire and the corresponding minimum cost.
Constraints:
·       1 <= T <= 10

Daenerys Targaryen has been suggested by her counselors to leave the Meereen and start conquering other parts of the world. But she knows giving up on the people of Meereen means victory of slavery. Her plan is to start conquering rest of the world while she remains in Meereen. She can only trust her bravest and most beloved Daario Naharis to undertake this risk. She asks him to conquer a few nations and promises him a help from her dragons. She also promises to marry him if he successfully conquers all the nations and not if he is defeated.
Daario has to conquer 'N' number of nations each nation with army size A[i]. He attacks the nations serially. As promised, he gets help from Daenerys's Dragons. His first 'M' attacks are made with the help of Dragons.

For first 'M' attacks, he gains A[i] soldiers.

For the rest, he looses ceiling of A[i]/2 soldiers.

He is defeated if he is left with no army before he conquers all the 'N' nations. He has no army initially and only has Dragons.

-----Input-----
First line has 'T' which is the number of test cases.
For each test cases there are two space separated integers 'N' and 'M' denoting the number of nations and the number of nations he has Dragon's help for respectively.
Follows N space separated integers denoting the size of army of each nation.

-----Output-----
Print 'VICTORY' if Daario conquers all nations and 'DEFEAT' if he doesn't.

Example case 1.

First 3 attacks add 1,2,3 to his army making it 6. (1+2+3 = 6)

Then he looses 2 and 3 making it 1. (6-2-3 = 1)

He conquers all so VICTORY.

Example case 2.

First 2 attacks add 4,4 to his army making it 8. (4+4 = 8)

Then he looses 2,2,2,2 making it 0. (8-2-2-2-2 = 0)

He conquers all so VICTORY.

Example case 3.

First 4 attacks add 10,10,10,10 to his army making it 40. (10+10+10+10 = 40)

Then he looses 25 and then all 15 out of possible 30 making it 0. (40-25-15 = 0)

He is defeated on 6th attack so DEFEAT.

Chef's friend Alex runs a movie theatre. Due to the increasing number of platforms for watching movies online, his business is not running well. As a friend, Alex asked Chef to help him maximise his profits. Since Chef is a busy person, he needs your help to support his friend Alex.  
Alex's theatre has four showtimes: 12 PM, 3 PM, 6 PM and 9 PM. He has four movies which he would like to play ― let's call them A, B, C and D. Each of these movies must be played exactly once and all four must be played at different showtimes. For each showtime, the price of a ticket must be one of the following: Rs 25, Rs 50, Rs 75 or Rs 100. The prices of tickets for different showtimes must also be different.
Through his app, Alex receives various requests from his customers. Each request has the form ""I want to watch this movie at this showtime"". Let's assume that the number of people who come to watch a movie at a given showtime is the same as the number of requests for that movie at that showtime.
It is not necessary to accommodate everyone's requests ― Alex just wants to earn the maximum amount of money. There is no restriction on the capacity of the theatre. However, for each movie that is not watched by anyone, Alex would suffer a loss of Rs 100 (deducted from the profit).
You are given $N$ requests Alex received during one day. Find the maximum amount of money he can earn on that day by choosing when to play which movies and with which prices. 

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- $N$ lines follow. Each of these lines contains a character $m$, followed by a space and an integer $t$, describing a request to see the movie $m$ at the showtime $t$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum profit Alex can earn (possibly negative).
Finally, print a line containing one integer ― the total profit over all test cases, i.e. over $T$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 150$
- $0 \le N \le 100$
- $m$ is 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D'
- $t$ is $12$, $3$, $6$ or $9$

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The following table shows the number of people that want to watch the movies at the given showtimes:  12  3  6  9   A   0  1  0 1  B   3  0  0  2   C   1  0  2  0   D   0  2  0  0 
The maximum number of requests was sent for movie B at 12 PM. Therefore, we play this movie at this time and the tickets cost Rs 100. Next, we play movie D at 3 PM with ticket price Rs 75 and movie C at 6 PM with ticket price Rs 50. Finally, we have a slot for 9 PM and the only movie we can play at that time now is movie A, with ticket price Rs 25. The total profit is $3 \cdot 100 + 2 \cdot 75 + 2 \cdot 50 + 1 \cdot 25 = 300 + 150 + 100 + 25 = 575$. Since each movie was watched by at least one person, there is no additional loss.
Example case 2: Just like above, we show the requests in a table:  12  3  6  9   A   0  0  0 3  B   0  0  2  0   C   0  1  0  0   D   1  0  0  0 
The optimal solution is to play movie A at 9 PM, movie B at 6 PM, movie C at 3 PM and movie D at 12 PM, with decreasing ticket prices in this order. The profit is $3 \cdot 100 + 2 \cdot 75 + 1 \cdot 50 + 1 \cdot 25 = 300+150+50+25 = 525$.
Example case 3: Again, we show the requests in a table:  12  3  6  9   A   0  0  0 1  B   0  0  1  0   C   0  0  0  0   D   0  0  0  0 
The optimal solution is to play movie A at 9 PM with ticket price Rs 100, movie B at 6 PM with ticket price Rs 75 and the remaining two movies in any order at 12 PM and 3 PM ― either way, there will be nobody watching them. We earn $1 \cdot 100 + 1 \cdot 75 = 175$, but we have to deduct Rs 200, so the resulting profit is $175 - 200 = -25$.
Example case 4: The optimal solution is to play movie D at 12 PM; the other three movies go unattended. We have to deduct Rs 300, so the profit is $1 \cdot 100 - 300 = -200$.
Example case 5: Since there are no requests for any movie at any time, all movies go unattended and Alex just suffers a loss of Rs 400.
The total profit for all 5 days is $575+525-25-200-400 = 475$.

Do you know Professor Saeed? He is the algorithms professor at Damascus University. Yesterday, he gave his students hard homework (he is known for being so evil) - for a given binary string $S$, they should compute the sum of $F(S, L, R)$ over all pairs of integers $(L, R)$ ($1 \le L \le R \le |S|$), where the function $F(S, L, R)$ is defined as follows:
- Create a string $U$: first, set $U = S$, and for each $i$ ($L \le i \le R$), flip the $i$-th character of $U$ (change '1' to '0' or '0' to '1').
- Then, $F(S, L, R)$ is the number of valid pairs $(i, i + 1)$ such that $U_i = U_{i+1}$.
As usual, Professor Saeed will give more points to efficient solutions. Please help the students solve this homework.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer $\sum_{1 \le L \le R \le |S|} F(S, L, R)$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le |S| \le 3 \cdot 10^6$
- the sum of $|S|$ over all test cases does not exceed $6 \cdot 10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (50 points):
- $1 \le |S| \le 300$
- the sum of $|S|$ over all test cases does not exceed $600$
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
1
001

-----Example Output-----
6

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1:
- $L = 1, R = 1$: $U$ is ""101"", $F = 0$
- $L = 2, R = 2$: $U$ is ""011"", $F = 1$
- $L = 3, R = 3$: $U$ is ""000"", $F = 2$
- $L = 1, R = 2$: $U$ is ""111"", $F = 2$
- $L = 2, R = 3$: $U$ is ""010"", $F = 0$
- $L = 1, R = 3$: $U$ is ""110"", $F = 1$

-----Problem Statement-----
One of the things JEC is known for is its GR (Group Recreation) where juniors and seniors do friendly interaction ;P
As for the new session of 2020 seniors decided to have their first GR and give them some treat. Juniors were excited about it they came to college canteen aligned in a line and counted themselves one by one from left to right so that every junior gets his/her treat. But seniors played a game and they will treat only the ones who passes in this game. Game is simple all they need to do is to alternate their language (between Hindi and English) while telling their positions that is if the junior just before you told 2 in English you need to say 3 in Hindi . You do not want to be the one left without a treat. 
You are the junior standing at position $X$ from left and the counting could start from left or right you have to predict which number you have to speak and in which language when your turn comes.

-----Input:-----
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
Each testcase contains 2 lines first consist 2 space separated integers, $N$ (total count) , $X$ (your position from left), next line consist of 2 space separated characters  L or R (Direction from which counting starts L-left, R-Right) and H or E (the language to start counting).

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single line consisting space seperated Integer P and Character L
where P is the number you will speak and L is the language (H or E).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 120$
- $1 \leq X \leq N$

-----Sample Input:-----
2
15 5
L H
20 14
R E

*try to trim extra white spaces like new line during input in case of wrong answer

-----Sample Output:-----
5 H
7 E

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- When counting starts from left with H it alternates like H E H E H….. on the fifth position H comes
- When Count starts from right with E it alternates like E H E H E H E….. with E on the position of 14th student from right.

It is well-known that the elephants are afraid of mouses. The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv is not an exception.

The Little Elephant is on a board A of n rows and m columns (0-based numeration). At the beginning he is in cell with coordinates (0; 0) and he wants to go to cell with coordinates (n-1; m-1). From cell (x; y) Little Elephant can go either to (x+1; y) or (x; y+1).

Each cell of the board contains either 1 or 0. If A[i][j] = 1, then there is a single mouse in cell (i; j). Mouse at cell (i; j) scared Little Elephants if and only if during the path there was at least one such cell (x; y) (which belongs to that path) and |i-x| + |j-y| <= 1.

Little Elephant wants to find some correct path from (0; 0) to (n-1; m-1) such that the number of mouses that have scared the Little Elephant is minimal possible. Print that number.

-----Input-----
First line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. First line of each test case contain pair of integers n and m - the size of the board. Next n lines contain n strings, each of size m and consisted of digits 0 and 1.

-----Output-----
In T lines print T integer - the answers for the corresponding test.

-----Constraints-----
1 <= T <= 50
2 <= n, m <= 100

AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.

-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.

-----Example-----

Walter White and Jesse Pinkman (a drug addict) both love to play with chemicals. One day they were playing with some chemicals to make an energy drink. Unknowingly they made a highly powerful drink. To test the drink on others also they called some of their friends and gave a drop of it to everyone. Now they all were feeling highly energetic and thought of an unique game to play with each other.
After pondering for a while, Jesse came up with an extraordinary idea of competing in a race around a circular globe with N checkpoints each of one unit. Walter and all their other friends agreed with it.They divided themselves in $2$ teams with $N$ teammates in each team.This race has two commencing points $A$ and $B$ strictly facing each other. Walter and his team commences from $A$ point and other team starts from $B$. Both the teams start running at the same time clockwise around the globe. Speed of every player is constant throughout the race. If a player has a speed $X$ then it means that he covers a distance of $X$ units in one second.The race ends when some member of one team overtakes all members of opposite team at any point of time. Now you have to tell if any team will win the race or not.They all are stubborn and can run forever just to win the race. Help them to know if it is possible in anyway that the race will come to an end. 
For Clarity, you can visualize the path as a circular paths where $A$ and $B$ are opposite ends of diameter. It can be proven that the actual circumference of circle do not affect the answer.
It is also possible that someone don't run at all.Keep in mind that the fastest one wins the race so does the code.

-----Input:------
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. 
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ number of teammates in both team.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2 \ldots A_N$ denoting speed of A's Team
- The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers  $B_1, B_2 \ldots B_N$ denoting speed of B's Team

-----Output:------
For each test case, print a single line denoting YES if the race ends at any point of time else NO

- $1 \leq T \leq 10$

Chef likes to travel very much. He plans some travel routes and wants to know their lengths. He hired you to make these calculations. But be careful, some of the routes are incorrect. There may be some misspelling in city names or there will be no road between some two consecutive cities in the route. Also note that Chef hates to visit the same city twice during his travel. Even the last city should differ from the first. Two consecutive cities in the route should also be different. So you need to check these conditions for the given routes too.

You will be given the list of all cities and all roads between them with their lengths. All roads are one-way. Also you will be given the list of all travel routes that Chef plans. For each route you should check whether it is correct and find its length in this case.

-----Input-----

The first line contains positive integer N, the number of cities. The second line contains space separated list of N strings, city names. All city names are distinct.

The third line contains non-negative integer M, the number of available roads. Each of the next M lines describes one road and contains names C1 and C2 of two cities followed by the positive integer D, the length of the one-way road that connects C1 with C2. It is guaranteed that C1 and C2 will be correct names of two different cities from the list of N cities given in the second line of the input file. For each pair of different cities there is at most one road in each direction and each road will be described exactly once in the input file.

Next line contains positive integer T, the number of travel routes planned by the Chef. Each of the next T lines contains positive integer K followed by K strings, names of cities of the current route. Cities are given in order in which Chef will visit them during his travel.

All strings in the input file composed only of lowercase, uppercase letters of the English alphabet and hyphens. Each string is non-empty and has length at most 20. If some line of the input file contains more then one element than consecutive elements of this line are separated by exactly one space. Each line of the input file has no leading or trailing spaces.

-----Output-----
For each travel route from the input file output a single line containing word ERROR if the route is incorrect and its length otherwise.

-----Constraints-----

1 <= N <= 50

0 <= M <= N * (N - 1)

1 <= D <= 20000

1 <= T <= 50

1 <= K <= 50

1 <= length of each string <= 20

-----Explanation-----
The 2nd route is incorrect since there is no road from New-York to Kiev. Note however that inverse road from Kiev to New-York exists. 

The 3rd route is incorrect since the first city coincides with the last one. 

The 4th route is incorrect since there is no city with name Kyiv (Probably Chef means Kiev but he misspells this word). 

The 8th route is incorrect since there is no road from Miami to Kiev. 

The 9th route is incorrect since there is no road from Donetsk to  Hollywood. 

The 10th route is correct. Note that a route composed of exactly one city is always correct provided that city name is written correctly. 

The 11th route is incorrect since there is no cities with names Mumbai and Deli. (Probably Chef is not so good in geography :)) 

The 12th route is incorrect since city New-York is visited twice. 

Finally the 13th route is incorrect since we have equal consecutive cities.

Once again, we have a lot of requests from coders for a challenging problem on geometry. Geometry expert Nitin is thinking about a problem with parabolas, icosahedrons, crescents and trapezoids, but for now, to encourage beginners, he chooses to work with circles and rectangles.
You are given two sequences $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ and $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_N$. You should choose a permutation $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N$ of the integers $1$ through $N$ and construct $N$ rectangles with dimensions $A_1 \times B_{P_1}, A_2 \times B_{P_2}, \ldots, A_N \times B_{P_N}$. Then, for each of these rectangles, you should construct an inscribed circle, i.e. a circle with the maximum possible area that is completely contained in that rectangle.
Let $S$ be the sum of diameters of these $N$ circles. Your task is to find the maximum value of $S$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. 
- The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_N$. 

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum value of $S$. It is guaranteed that this value is always an integer.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 50$
- $1 \le N \le 10^4$
- $1 \le A_i, B_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----

- $A_1 = A_2 = \ldots = A_N$
- $B_1 = B_2 = \ldots = B_N$

Get excited, folks, because it is time for the final match of Codechef Premier League (CPL)!
Mike and Tracy also want to watch the grand finale, but unfortunately, they could not get tickets to the match. However, Mike is not someone who gives up so easily — he has a plan to watch the match.
The field where the match is played is surrounded by a wall with height $K$. Outside, there are $N$ boxes (numbered $1$ through $N$). For each valid $i$, the $i$-th box has a height $H_i$.
Mike wants to take some boxes and stack them on top of each other to build two towers. The height of each tower is the sum of heights of all the boxes that form it. Of course, no box may be in both towers. The height of each tower should be at least $K$. Then Mike can climb on top of one tower and Tracy on top of the other, and they can watch the match uninterrupted!
While Mike is busy stacking the boxes, Tracy would like to know the smallest number of boxes required to build two towers such that each of them has height at least $K$, or at least that it is impossible to build such towers. Can you help Tracy?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the smallest number of boxes required to build two towers, or $-1$ if it is impossible.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 5$
- $1 \leq N, K \leq 4,000$
- $1 \leq H_i \leq 10^5$ for each valid $i$

Example case 1: The first tower can be built with boxes $8 + 10 + 20 = 38$ and the second tower with boxes $7 + 7 + 8 + 19 = 41$. In this case, the box with height $7$ is left unused.
Example case 2: We only need the box with height $10$ for one tower and the box with height $9$ for the other tower.

Chef hates unoptimized codes and people who write such codes. One fine day he decided to look through the kitchen's codebase and found a function whose pseudo-code is given here:

input: integer N, list X[1, 2, ..., N], list Y[1, 2, ..., N]

output: integer res

function:

set res = 0;
for i := 1 to N do
for j := 1 to N do
for k := 1 to N do
if (X[i] = X[j]) OR (X[j] = X[k]) OR (X[k] = X[i])
continue
else
set res = max(res, Y[i] + Y[j] + Y[k])
return res

Luckily enough this code gets triggered only if the Head Chef makes a submission. But still there is a possibility that this can crash the judge. So help Chef by writing a new function which does the same thing but is faster.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in the two lists.
- The i-th of the next N lines contains a pair of space-separated integers denoting the values of X[i] and Y[i] respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output an integer corresponding to the return value of the function.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
- 1 ≤ X[i], Y[i] ≤ 108

11

-----Explanation-----
Testcase 2: The maximum is attained when i = 1, j = 2 and k = 5. This leads to res being 3 + 4 + 4 = 11. This value is attained in other iterations as well, but it never exceeds this, and hence this is the answer.

Chef Shifu wanted to celebrate the success of his new restaurant with all his employees. He was willing to host a party and he had decided the location of the party as well. However, Chef Shifu was a shy person and wanted to communicate with the least possible employees to inform them about the party, and that these employees could inform their friends.

Note that an employee could only inform his/her immediate friends about the party, not his/her friends’ friends.

Chef Shifu has a list of all the friendships among his employees. Help him find the minimum number of employees he should inform, so that every employee knows about the celebration party.

-----Input-----
First line contains a single integer T - the total number of testcases.

T testcases follow. For each testcase:

The first line contains 2 space-separated integers N and M - the total number of employees working under Chef Shifu and the number of friendship relations.

M lines follow - each line contains 2 space-separated integers u and v, indicating that employee u is a friend of employee v and vice-versa.

The employees are numbered from 1 to N, and each employee is assigned a distinct integer.

-----Output-----
For each testcase, print the minimum number of employees to be informed on a new line.

Explanation

In testcase 1, since every employee is a friend of every other employee, we just need to select 1 employee.
In testcase 2, selecting employees 2 and 4 would ensure that all 4 employees are represented.

Similarly, selecting employees 1 and 3 would also ensure that all 4 employees are selected.

In both cases, we must select 2 employees in the best case.

Did you hear about the Nibiru collision ? It is a supposed disastrous encounter between the earth and a large planetary object. Astronomers reject this idea. But why listen to other people's beliefs and opinions. We are coders above all, so what better way than to verify it by a small code. The earth and N asteroids are in the 2D plane. Each of them is initially located at some integer coordinates at time = 0 and is moving parallel to one of the X or Y axis with constant velocity of 1 unit per second. 

Direction of movement is given as 'U' ( Up = towards positive Y ), 'D' ( Down = towards negative Y ), 'R' ( Right = towards positive X ), 'L' ( Left = towards negative X ). Given the initial position and the direction of movement of the earth and each of the N asteroids, find the earliest time at which the earth collides with one of the asteroids. If there can not be any collisions with the earth, print ""SAFE"" ( without quotes ). You can ignore the collisions between asteroids ( i.e., they continue to move in same direction even after collisions between them ).

-----Input-----

First line contains T, number of test cases. T cases follow. In each test case, first line contains XE YE DIRE, where (XE,YE) is the initial position of the Earth, DIRE is the direction in which it moves. Second line contains N, the number of
asteroids. N lines follow, each containing XA YA DIRA, the initial position and the direction of movement of each asteroid. No asteroid is initially located at (XE,YE)

-----Output-----

For each test case, output the earliest time at which the earth can collide with an asteroid (rounded to 1 position after decimal). If there can not be any collisions with the earth, print ""SAFE"" (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

1 ≤ N ≤ 2012

-100 ≤ XE, YE, XA, YA ≤ 100

(XE,YE) != any of (XA,YA)

DIRE, DIRA is one of 'U', 'R', 'D', 'L'

Output:

Explanation:

Case 1 : 

Time 0 - Earth (0,0) Asteroids { (1,-2), (2,2) }

Time 1 - Earth (1,0) Asteroids { (1,-1), (2,1) }

Time 2 - Earth (2,0) Asteroids { (1,0 ), (2,0) }

Case 2 : 

The only asteroid is just one unit away below the earth and following us always, but it will never collide :)

Case 3 : 

Time 0 - Earth (0,0) Asteroid (3,0)

Time 1 - Earth (1,0) Asteroid (2,0)

Time 1.5 - Earth (1.5,0) Asteroid (1.5,0)

Note : There are multiple test sets, and the judge shows the sum of the time taken over all test sets of your submission, if Accepted.

RANJANA QUIZ
-----

Prof. Ranjana decided to conduct a quiz in her class. She divided all the students of her
class into groups of three. Consider that no student was left out after the division. She gave
different sets of questions to every group. A set is said to be unique if there is no other team that
received the same number of maths, science and english questions. In every set, maximum
questions for each group were related to maths, then science, and the least number of
questions were related to English. Total number of questions given to each team can be
different. 

After the test, the CR of the class asked every team to report the number of questions
they got on each subject. The CR wants to know the number of unique sets of questions that
were given to the teams, the problem is that all the students have just submitted the number of
questions of each subject but in no particular order. Help the CR to find the number of unique
sets

-----Input Format-----

Line 1 contains the number of teams ‘n’. In the next n lines, each line contains three space separated integers,i.e, the number of questions of each subject(in no particular order).

-----Output-----

Print the number of unique sets

You are given a weighted undirected graph consisting of n$n$ nodes and m$m$ edges. The nodes are numbered from 1$1$ to n$n$. The graph does not contain any multiple edges or self loops.
A walk W$W$ on the graph is a sequence of vertices (with repetitions of vertices and edges allowed) such that every adjacent pair of vertices in the sequence is an edge of the graph. We define the cost of a walk W$W$, Cost(W)$Cost(W)$, as the maximum over the weights of the edges along the walk. 
You will be given q$q$ queries. In each query, you will be given an integer X$X$.

You have to count the number of different walks W$W$ of length 4$4$ such that Cost(W)$Cost(W)$ = X$X$.

Two walks are considered different if they do not represent the same edge sequence.

-----Input:-----
- First line contains 2 integers : the number of nodes n$n$ and number of edges m$m$.
- Next m$m$ lines each describe u$u$, v$v$ and w$w$, describing an edge between u$u$ and v$v$ with weight w$w$.
- Next line contains q$q$, the number of queries.
- Next q$q$ lines each describe an integer X$X$ - the cost of the walk in the query.

-----Output:-----
For each query, output in a single line the number of different possible walks.

-----Constraints-----

A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family …) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

There are $N$ cars (numbered $1$ through $N$) on a circular track with length $N$. For each $i$ ($2 \le i \le N$), the $i$-th of them is at a distance $i-1$ clockwise from car $1$, i.e. car $1$ needs to travel a distance $i-1$ clockwise to reach car $i$. Also, for each valid $i$, the $i$-th car has $f_i$ litres of gasoline in it initially.
You are driving car $1$ in the clockwise direction. To move one unit of distance in this direction, you need to spend $1$ litre of gasoline. When you pass another car (even if you'd run out of gasoline exactly at that point), you steal all its gasoline. Once you do not have any gasoline left, you stop.
What is the total clockwise distance travelled by your car? 

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the total clockwise distance travelled.

Sometimes Sergey visits fast food restaurants. Today he is going to visit the one called PizzaKing.
Sergey wants to buy N meals, which he had enumerated by integers from 1 to N. He knows that the meal i costs Ci rubles. He also knows that there are M meal sets in the restaurant.
The meal set is basically a set of meals, where you pay Pj burles and get Qj meals - Aj, 1, Aj, 2, ..., Aj, Qj.
Sergey has noticed that sometimes he can save money by buying the meals in the meal sets instead of buying each one separately. And now he is curious about what is the smallest amount of rubles he needs to spend to have at least one portion of each of the meals.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a pair of integer numbers N and M denoting the number of meals and the number of the meal sets.
The second line contains N space-separated integers C1, C2, ..., CN denoting the costs of the meals, bought separately.
Each of the following M lines starts with a pair of integer numbers Pi and Qi, denoting the cost of the meal set and the number of meals in it, followed with the integer numbers Ai, 1 Ai, 2, ..., Ai, Qi denoting the meal numbers.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the minimal total amount of money Sergey needs to spend in order to have at least one portion of each meal.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ Pi, Ci ≤ 106
- 1 ≤ M ≤ min{2N, 2 × 100000}
- No meal appears in the set twice or more times.
- Subtask 1 (16 points): 1 ≤ T ≤ 103, 1 ≤ N ≤ 8
- Subtask 2 (23 points): For each test file, either 1 ≤ T ≤ 10, 1 ≤ N ≤ 12 or the constraints for Subtask 1 are held.
- Subtask 3 (61 points): For each test file, either T = 1, 1 ≤ N ≤ 18 or the constraints for Subtask 1 or 2 are held.

-----Example-----
Input:1
3 3
3 5 6
11 3 1 2 3
5 2 1 2
5 2 1 3

Output:10

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. If Sergey buys all the meals separately, it would cost him 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 rubles. He can buy all of them at once by buying the first meal set, which costs for 11 rubles, but the optimal strategy would be either to buy the second and the third meal set, thus, paying 5 + 5 = 10 rubles, or to buy the third meal set and the second meal separately by paying the same amount of 10 rubles.

There are a lot of problems related to the shortest paths. Nevertheless, there are not much problems, related to the shortest paths in average.
Consider a directed graph G, consisting of N nodes and M edges. Consider a walk from the node A to the node B in this graph. The average length of this walk will be total sum of weight of its' edges divided by number of edges. Every edge counts as many times as it appears in this path.
Now, your problem is quite simple. For the given graph and two given nodes, find out the shortest average length of the walk between these nodes. Please note, that the length of the walk need not to be finite, but average walk length will be.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a pair of space-separated integers N and M denoting the number of nodes and the number of edges in the graph.
Each of the following M lines contains a triple of space-separated integers Xi Yi Zi, denoting the arc, connecting the node Xi to the node Yi (but not vice-versa!) having the weight of Zi.
The next line contains a pair of space separated integers A and B, denoting the first and the last node of the path.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the length of the shortest path in average.
If there is no path at all, output just -1 on the corresponding line of the output.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 500
- 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000
- A is not equal to B
- 1 ≤ A, B, Xi, Yi ≤ N
- 1 ≤ Zi ≤ 100
- There are no self-loops and multiple edges in the graph.
- 1 ≤ sum of N over all test cases ≤ 10000
- 1 ≤ sum of M over all test cases ≤ 20000

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask #1 (45 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 10, 1 ≤ M ≤ 20; Your answer will be considered correct in case it has an absolute or relative error of no more than 10-2.
- Subtask #2 (55 points): no additional constraints; Your answer will be considered correct in case it has an absolute or relative error of no more than 10-6.

Chef owns an icecream shop in Chefland named scoORZ. There are only three types of coins in Chefland: Rs. 5, Rs. 10 and Rs. 15. An icecream costs Rs. 5.
There are $N$ people (numbered $1$ through $N$) standing in a queue to buy icecream from scoORZ. Each person wants to buy exactly one icecream. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th person has one coin with value $a_i$. It is only possible for someone to buy an icecream when Chef can give them back their change exactly ― for example, if someone pays with a Rs. 10 coin, Chef needs to have a Rs. 5 coin that he gives to this person as change.
Initially, Chef has no money. He wants to know if he can sell icecream to everyone in the queue, in the given order. Since he is busy eating his own icecream, can you tell him if he can serve all these people?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string ""YES"" if all people can be served or ""NO"" otherwise (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 10^3$
- $a_i \in \{5, 10, 15\}$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----

-----Example Output-----
YES
NO
NO

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The first person pays with a Rs. 5 coin. The second person pays with a Rs. 10 coin and Chef gives them back the Rs. 5 coin (which he got from the first person) as change.
Example case 2: The first person already cannot buy an icecream because Chef cannot give them back Rs. 5.
Example case 3: The first person pays with a Rs. 5 coin. The second person cannot buy the icecream because Chef has only one Rs. 5 coin, but he needs to give a total of Rs. 10 back as change.

Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

Our chef has recently opened a new restaurant with a unique style. The restaurant is divided into K compartments (numbered from 1 to K) and each compartment can be occupied by at most one customer. 
Each customer that visits the restaurant has a strongly preferred compartment p (1 ≤ p ≤ K), and if that compartment is already occupied, then the customer simply leaves. Now obviously, the chef wants to maximize the total number of customers that dine at his restaurant and so he allows (or disallows) certain customers so as to achieve this task. You are to help him with this. 
Given a list of N customers with their arrival time, departure time and the preferred compartment, you need to calculate the maximum number of customers that can dine at the restaurant. 

-----Input-----
The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two integers N and  K , the number of customers that plan to visit the chef's restaurant and the number of compartments the restaurant is divided into respectively. Each of the next N lines contains three integers si, fi and pi , the arrival time, departure time and the strongly preferred compartment of the ith customer respectively.  

Note that the ith customer wants to occupy the pith compartment from [si, fi)  i.e the ith customer leaves just before   fi  so that another customer can occupy that compartment from   fi  onwards.

-----Output-----
For every test case, print in a single line the maximum number of customers that dine at the restaurant.

-----Constraints-----
-  1 ≤  T ≤   30 
-  0  ≤ N  ≤  105 
-  1  ≤  K  ≤  109 
-  0  ≤  si < fi ≤   109 
-  1  ≤  pi  ≤  K

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.

All three customers want different compartments and hence all 3 can be accommodated.

Example case 2.

If we serve the 1st, 2nd and 4th customers, then we can get a maximum of 3.

Chef has a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. For a positive integer $M$, sequence $B$ is defined as $B = A*M$ that is, appending $A$ exactly $M$ times. For example, If $A = [1, 2]$ and $M = 3$, then $B = A*M = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]$
You have to help him to find out the minimum value of $M$ such that the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence is maximum possible.

-----Input:-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum value of $M$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 500$
- $1 \le N \le 2*10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$
- It's guaranteed that the total length of the sequence $A$ in one test file doesn't exceed $2*10^6$

-----Explanation:-----
In the first test case, Choosing $M = 2$ gives $B = [2, 1, 2, 1]$ which has a longest strictly increasing sequence of length $2$ which is the maximum possible.
In the second test case, Choosing $M = 1$ gives $B  = [1, 2]$ which has a longest strictly increasing sequence of length $2$ which is the maximum possible.

Raj loves to listen to songs in his free time. It’s his birthday tomorrow and his friend Neelansh wants his gift to be the most unique. Being great at making music, he decides to produce a song for him. However, Raj likes songs according to their beauty. He determines the beauty of the song as the number of times all the octave musical tones are completed in ascending order.

He begins with a jumbled tone of length N and numbers each octave tone as 1,2,3….8.

Neelansh wants to maximize the beauty of the song but since he uses the trial version of the software,
- He cannot change the size of N.
- He cannot introduce any new tone, but can choose any two tones and swap their positions

However, Neelansh just received a mail that he needs to submit all his pending assignments by tomorrow. He has tons of assignments left to do, but he doesn’t want to spoil the idea of his gift. Can you help him? 

-----INPUT-----
- The first line contains a single integer T- the number of test cases  
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N- the length of the song  
- The second line contains N- space separated integers ai,  ai+1,.....aN

Chef is operating a slush machine. The machine produces slush drinks with $M$ flavors (numbered $1$ through $M$); for each valid $i$, the maximum number of drinks with flavour $i$ the machine can produce is $C_i$.
Chef expects $N$ customers to come buy slush drinks today. The customers are numbered $1$ through $N$ in the order in which they buy the drinks. For each valid $i$, the favorite flavour of the $i$-th customer is $D_i$ and this customer is willing to pay $F_i$ units of money for a drink with this flavour, or $B_i$ units of money for a drink with any other flavuor. Whenever a customer wants to buy a drink:
- if it is possible to sell this customer a drink with their favourite flavour, Chef must sell them a drink with this flavour
- otherwise, Chef must sell this customer a drink, but he may choose its flavour
Chef wants to make the maximum possible profit. He is asking you to help him decide the flavours of the drinks he should sell to the customers in order to maximise the profit.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- The second line contains $M$ space-separated integers $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_M$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers $D_i$, $F_i$ and $B_i$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print two lines:
- The first of these lines should contain a single integer — the maximum profit.
- The second line should contain $N$ space-separated integers denoting the flavours of the drinks Chef should sell, in this order.
If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $2 \le N, M \le 10^5$
- $1 \le D_i \le M$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le C_i \le N$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le B_i < F_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
- $C_1+C_2+\ldots+C_M \ge N$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

Example Case 1. All three boys like the first girl, so there are (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1), (2, 3, 1) collisions with her. Boys 1 and 3 both like the second girl so this is one more collision. Only one boy likes the third girl, so there are no collisions with her and thus we have 4 collisions total.
Example Case 2. For each girl there is only one boy who likes her, so there are no collisions at all.

There are N islands in the sea, enumerated from 1 to N. Each of them is so small that we can consider them as points on a plane. You are given the Cartesian coordinates of all islands. X-axis is directed towards East and Y-axis is directed towards North.
You need to illuminate all the islands. To do this, you can place lighthouses on some of the islands. You can't place more than one lighthouse on any single island. Each lighthouse can light only one of the 4 quadrants: North-Western, North-Eastern, South-Western or South-Eastern. If some island is located on the border of an illuminated quadrant, it is considered to be illuminated as well. Note that this means that a lighthouse always illuminates it's own island as well.
Find the smallest possible number of lighthouses required to illuminate all the islands (say L). Describe their configurations — positions and quadrants illuminated — as well.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of islands.
The ith of the following N lines contains two integers Xi and Yi denoting the coordinates of the ith island.

-----Output-----
For each test case, first line of output must contain minimum number of lighthouses required to illuminate all islands, L.
Following L lines must describe configuration of the lighthouses, one configuration per line. Description of a lighthouse configuration consists of the number of the island where the lighthouse is placed, and the direction of the quadrant (NW for North-Western, NE for North-Eastern, SW for South-Western, SE for South-Eastern) illuminated by it, separated by a single space.
If there are many possible placements, output any one of them.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
- The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 5*105
- Absolute value of each coordinate doesn't exceed 109
- No two given islands coincide.

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask 1: (15 points)
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 8
- Absolute value of each coordinate doesn't exceed 50

Chef has recently been playing a lot of chess in preparation for the ICCT (International Chef Chess Tournament).
Since putting in long hours is not an easy task, Chef's mind wanders elsewhere. He starts counting the number of squares with odd side length on his chessboard..
However, Chef is not satisfied. He wants to know the number of squares of odd side length on a generic $N*N$ chessboard.

-----Input:-----
- The first line will contain a single integer $T$, the number of test cases.
- The next $T$ lines will have a single integer $N$, the size of the chess board.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a integer denoting the number of squares with odd length.

Alice and Johnny are playing a simple guessing game. Johnny picks an arbitrary positive integer n (1<=n<=109) and gives Alice exactly k hints about the value of n. It is Alice's task to guess n, based on the received hints. 

Alice often has a serious problem guessing the value of n, and she's beginning to suspect that Johnny occasionally cheats, that is, gives her incorrect hints. 
After the last game, they had the following little conversation:

- [Alice] Johnny, you keep cheating!

- [Johnny] Indeed? You cannot prove it.

- [Alice] Oh yes I can. In fact, I can tell you with the utmost certainty that in the last game you lied to me at least *** times.

So, how many times at least did Johnny lie to Alice? Try to determine this, knowing only the hints Johnny gave to Alice.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains t, the number of test cases (about 20). Exactly t test cases follow. 

Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer k, denoting the number of hints given by Johnny (1<=k<=100000). Each of the next k lines contains exactly one hint. The i-th hint is of the form:
operator li logical_value
where operator denotes one of the symbols < , > , or =; li is an integer (1<=li<=109), while logical_value is one of the words: Yes or No. The hint is considered correct if logical_value is the correct reply to the question: ""Does the relation: n operator li hold?"", and is considered to be false (a lie) otherwise.

-----Output-----
For each test case output a line containing a single integer, equal to the minimal possible number of Johnny's lies during the game.

-----Example-----
Input:
3
2
< 100 No
> 100 No
3
< 2 Yes
> 4 Yes
= 3 No
6
< 2 Yes
> 1 Yes
= 1 Yes
= 1 Yes
> 1 Yes
= 1 Yes

Output:
0
1
2

Explanation: for the respective test cases, the number picked by Johnny could have been e.g. n=100, n=5, and n=1.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 50
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 50

Let's define a periodic infinite sequence S$S$ (0$0$-indexed) with period K$K$ using the formula Si=(i%K)+1$S_i = (i \% K) + 1$.
Chef has found a sequence of positive integers A$A$ with length N$N$ buried underground. He suspects that it is a contiguous subsequence of some periodic sequence. Unfortunately, some elements of A$A$ are unreadable. Can you tell Chef the longest possible period K$K$ of an infinite periodic sequence which contains A$A$ (after suitably filling in the unreadable elements) as a contiguous subsequence?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N$N$. 
- The second line contains N$N$ space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN$A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$. Unreadable elements are denoted by −1$-1$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line.
- If the period can be arbitrarily large, this line should contain a single string ""inf"".
- Otherwise, if A$A$ cannot be a contiguous subsequence of a periodic sequence, it should contain a single string ""impossible"".
- Otherwise, it should contain a single integer — the maximum possible period.

Young Sheldon is given the task to teach Chemistry to his brother Georgie. After teaching him how to find total atomic weight, Sheldon gives him some formulas which consist of $x$, $y$ and $z$ atoms as an assignment. 
You already know that Georgie doesn't like Chemistry, so he want you to help him solve this assignment.
Let the chemical formula be given by the string $S$. It consists of any combination of x, y and z with some value associated with it as well as parenthesis to encapsulate any combination. Moreover, the atomic weight of x, y and z are 2, 4 and 10 respectively.
You are supposed to find the total atomic weight of the element represented by the given formula.
For example, for the formula $(x_2y_2)_3z$, given string $S$ will be: $(x2y2)3z$. Hence, substituting values of x, y and z, total atomic weight will be 
$(2*2+4*2)*3 + 10 = 46$.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input $S$. 

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line, the total atomic weight.

-----Constraints-----

Devu is a class teacher of a class of n students. One day, in the morning prayer of the school, all the students of his class were standing in a line. You are given information of their arrangement by a string s. The string s consists of only letters 'B' and 'G', where 'B' represents a boy and 'G' represents a girl.
Devu wants inter-gender interaction among his class should to be maximum. So he does not like seeing two or more boys/girls standing nearby (i.e. continuous) in the line. e.g. he does not like the arrangements BBG and GBB, but he likes BG, GBG etc.
Now by seeing the initial arrangement s of students, Devu may get furious and now he wants to change this arrangement into a likable arrangement. For achieving that, he can swap positions of any two students (not necessary continuous). Let the cost of swapping people from position i with position j (i ≠ j) be c(i, j). You are provided an integer variable type, then the cost of the the swap will be defined by c(i, j) = |j − i|type.

Please help Devu in finding minimum cost of swaps needed to convert the current arrangement into a likable one.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases are follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer type, denoting the type of the cost function. Then the next line contains string s of length n, denoting the initial arrangement s of students.
Note that the integer n is not given explicitly in input.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the answer of the test case, that is, the minimum cost to convert the current arrangement into a likable one. If it is not possible to convert the current arrangement into a likable one, then print -1 instead of the minimum cost.

-----Explanation-----
Note type of the first 3 test cases is 0. So c(i, j) = 1. Hence we just have to count minimum number of swaps needed.
Example case 1. There is no way to make sure that both the boys does not stand nearby. So answer is -1.
Example case 2. Arrangement is already valid. No swap is needed. So answer is 0.
Example case 3. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 2. After swap the arrangement will be BGBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is 1.
Now type of the next 3 test cases is 1. So c(i, j) = |j − i|, that is, the absolute value of the difference between i and j.
Example case 4. Swap boy at position 0 with girl at position 1. After swap the arrangement will be GBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |1 - 0| = 1.
Example case 5. Swap boy at position 0 with girl at position 1. After swap the arrangement will be GBGB which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |1 - 0| = 1.
Example case 6. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 4. After swap the arrangement will be BGBGB which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |4 - 1| = 3.
Then type of the last 2 test cases is 2. So c(i, j) = (j − i)2
Example case 7. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 2. After swap the arrangement will be BGBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is (2 - 1)2 = 1.
Example case 8. Arrangement is already valid. No swap is needed. So answer is 0.

Tuzik and Vanya are playing the following game.
They have an N × M board and a chip to indicate the current game position. The chip can be placed on any one cell of the game board, each of which is uniquely identified by an ordered pair of positive integers (r, c), where 1 ≤ r ≤ N is the row number and 1 ≤ c ≤ M is the column number.
Initially, the chip is placed at the cell identified as (1, 1). For his move, a player can move it either 1, 2 or 3 cells up, or 1 or 2 cells to the right. The player who can not move the chip loses. In other words, a player suffers defeat if the chip is placed in the cell (N, M) at the start of his turn.
Tuzik starts the game. You have to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

-----Input-----
The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of tests. Each of the following T lines contain two integers N and M.

-----Output-----
For each test output ""Tuzik"" or ""Vanya"" on a separate line, indicating who will win the game.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 106

-----Example-----
Input:

-----Explanation-----Test case 1: On his first turn Tuzik moves chip 3 cells up to the cell (4, 1). On his turn Vanya can move chip only right to the cell (4, 2) or to the cell (4, 3) and after that Tuzik moves it to (4, 4) and finishes the game.

Test case 2: On his first Turn Tuzik can move chip to the cell (2, 1) or (1, 2), but on his next turn Vanya moves it to (2, 2) and wins the game.

Zonal Computing Olympiad 2014, 30 Nov 2013

In IPL 2025, the amount that each player is paid varies from match to match.  The match fee depends on the quality of opposition, the venue etc.

The match fees for each match in the new season have been announced in advance.  Each team has to enforce a mandatory rotation policy so that no player ever plays three matches in a row during the season.

Nikhil is the captain and chooses the team for each match. He wants to allocate a playing schedule for himself to maximize his earnings through match fees during the season.  

-----Input format-----
Line 1: A single integer N, the number of games in the IPL season.
Line 2: N non-negative integers, where the integer in
position i represents the fee for match i.

-----Output format-----
The output consists of a single non-negative integer, the
maximum amount of money that Nikhil can earn during this IPL
season.

You are given $N$ gears numbered $1$ through $N$. For each valid $i$, gear $i$ has $A_i$ teeth. In the beginning, no gear is connected to any other. Your task is to process $M$ queries and simulate the gears' mechanism. There are three types of queries:
- Type 1: Change the number of teeth of gear $X$ to $C$.
- Type 2: Connect two gears $X$ and $Y$.
- Type 3: Find the speed of rotation of gear $Y$ if gear $X$ rotates with speed $V$.
It is known that if gear $i$ is directly connected to gear $j$ and gear $i$ rotates with speed $V$, then gear $j$ will rotate with speed $-V A_i / A_j$, where the sign of rotation speed denotes the direction of rotation (so minus here denotes rotation in the opposite direction). You may also notice that gears can be blocked in some cases. This happens when some gear would have to rotate in different directions. If a gear is connected to any blocked gear, it is also blocked. For example, if three gears are connected to each other, this configuration can not rotate at all, and if we connect a fourth gear to these three, it will also be blocked and not rotate.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$.
- The following $M$ lines describe queries. Each of these lines begins with an integer $T$ denoting the type of the current query.
- If $T = 1$, it is followed by a space and two space-separated integers $X$ and $C$.
- If $T = 2$, it is followed by a space and two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$.
- If $T = 3$, it is followed by a space and three space-separated integers $X$, $Y$ and $V$.

-----Output-----
For each query of type 3, print a single line containing two integers separated by a slash '/' — the numerator and denominator of the rotation speed of the given gear expressed as an irreducible fraction (even if this speed is an integer), or $0$ if the gear does not rotate at all.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le M \le 2\cdot 10^5$
- $6 \le A_i \le 10^6$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le X, Y \le N$
- $1 \le C, V \le 10^6$

-----Example Output-----

-9/4
7/1

0

-----Explanation-----
For the first query of type 3, there are no connections between gears, so the answer is $0$.
For the second query of type 3, we can calculate the rotation speed using the formula $-3\cdot\frac{6}{8} = \frac{-9}{4}$.
For the third query of type 3, we can use the formula twice, so the speed of the second gear is $-10\cdot\frac{7}{8} = -\frac{35}{4}$, and the speed of the third gear is $-(-\frac{35}{4})\frac{8}{10} = \frac{7}{1}$.
For the last query of type 3, all gears are blocked.

There are some websites that are accessible through several different addresses. For example, for a long time Codeforces was accessible with two hostnames codeforces.com and codeforces.ru.

You are given a list of page addresses being queried. For simplicity we consider all addresses to have the form http://<hostname>[/<path>], where:

  <hostname> — server name (consists of words and maybe some dots separating them),  /<path> — optional part, where <path> consists of words separated by slashes. 

We consider two <hostname> to correspond to one website if for each query to the first <hostname> there will be exactly the same query to the second one and vice versa — for each query to the second <hostname> there will be the same query to the first one. Take a look at the samples for further clarifications.

Your goal is to determine the groups of server names that correspond to one website. Ignore groups consisting of the only server name.

Please note, that according to the above definition queries http://<hostname> and http://<hostname>/ are different.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of page queries. Then follow n lines each containing exactly one address. Each address is of the form http://<hostname>[/<path>], where:

  <hostname> consists of lowercase English letters and dots, there are no two consecutive dots, <hostname> doesn't start or finish with a dot. The length of <hostname> is positive and doesn't exceed 20.  <path> consists of lowercase English letters, dots and slashes. There are no two consecutive slashes, <path> doesn't start with a slash and its length doesn't exceed 20. 

Addresses are not guaranteed to be distinct.

-----Output-----

First print k — the number of groups of server names that correspond to one website. You should count only groups of size greater than one.

Next k lines should contain the description of groups, one group per line. For each group print all server names separated by a single space. You are allowed to print both groups and names inside any group in arbitrary order.

You are at the top left cell $(1, 1)$ of an $n \times m$ labyrinth. Your goal is to get to the bottom right cell $(n, m)$. You can only move right or down, one cell per step. Moving right from a cell $(x, y)$ takes you to the cell $(x, y + 1)$, while moving down takes you to the cell $(x + 1, y)$.

Some cells of the labyrinth contain rocks. When you move to a cell with rock, the rock is pushed to the next cell in the direction you're moving. If the next cell contains a rock, it gets pushed further, and so on.

The labyrinth is surrounded by impenetrable walls, thus any move that would put you or any rock outside of the labyrinth is illegal.

Count the number of different legal paths you can take from the start to the goal modulo $10^9 + 7$. Two paths are considered different if there is at least one cell that is visited in one path, but not visited in the other.

-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n, m$ — dimensions of the labyrinth ($1 \leq n, m \leq 2000$).

Next $n$ lines describe the labyrinth. Each of these lines contains $m$ characters. The $j$-th character of the $i$-th of these lines is equal to ""R"" if the cell $(i, j)$ contains a rock, or ""."" if the cell $(i, j)$ is empty.

It is guaranteed that the starting cell $(1, 1)$ is empty.

-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of different legal paths from $(1, 1)$ to $(n, m)$ modulo $10^9 + 7$.

-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
1

Input
2 3
...
..R

Output
0

Input
4 4
...R
.RR.
.RR.
R...

Output
4

-----Note-----

In the first sample case we can't (and don't have to) move, hence the only path consists of a single cell $(1, 1)$.

In the second sample case the goal is blocked and is unreachable.

Illustrations for the third sample case can be found here: https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1225/index.html

Write a function called `sumIntervals`/`sum_intervals()` that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.

### Intervals

Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array. The first value of the interval will always be less than the second value. Interval example: `[1, 5]` is an interval from 1 to 5. The length of this interval is 4.

### Overlapping Intervals

List containing overlapping intervals:

```
[
   [1,4],
   [7, 10],
   [3, 5]
]
```

The sum of the lengths of these intervals is 7. Since [1, 4] and [3, 5] overlap, we can treat the interval as [1, 5], which has a length of 4.

### Examples:

```C#
// empty intervals
Intervals.SumIntervals(new (int, int)[]{ });  // => 0
Intervals.SumIntervals(new (int, int)[]{ (2, 2), (5, 5)});  // => 0

// disjoined intervals
Intervals.SumIntervals(new (int, int)[]{
  (1, 2), (3, 5)
});  // => (2-1) + (5-3) = 3

// overlapping intervals
Intervals.SumIntervals(new (int, int)[]{
  (1, 4), (3, 6), (2, 8)
});  // (1,8) => 7
```

# 'Magic' recursion call depth number

This Kata was designed as a Fork to the one from donaldsebleung Roboscript series with a reference to:

https://www.codewars.com/collections/roboscript

It is not more than an extension of Roboscript infinite ""single-"" mutual recursion handling to a ""multiple-"" case.

One can suppose that you have a machine that works through a specific language. It uses the script, which consists of 3 major commands:

 - `F` - Move forward by 1 step in the direction that it is currently pointing.

 - `L` - Turn ""left"" (i.e. rotate 90 degrees anticlockwise).

 - `R` - Turn ""right"" (i.e. rotate 90 degrees clockwise).

The number n afterwards enforces the command to execute n times.

To improve its efficiency machine language is enriched by patterns that are containers to pack and unpack the script.

The basic syntax for defining a pattern is as follows:

`pnq`

Where:

 - `p` is a ""keyword"" that declares the beginning of a pattern definition 

 - `n` is a non-negative integer, which acts as a unique identifier for the pattern (pay attention, it may contain several digits).

 - `` is a valid RoboScript code (without the angled brackets)

 - `q` is a ""keyword"" that marks the end of a pattern definition 

For example, if you want to define `F2LF2` as a pattern and reuse it later:

```
p333F2LF2q
```

To invoke a pattern, a capital `P` followed by the pattern identifier `(n)` is used:

```
P333
```

It doesn't matter whether the invocation of the pattern or the pattern definition comes first. Pattern definitions should always be parsed first.

```
P333p333P11F2LF2qP333p11FR5Lq
```

# ___Infinite recursion___

As we don't want a robot to be damaged or damaging someone else by becoming uncontrolable when stuck in an infinite loop, it's good to considere this possibility in the programs and to build a compiler that can detect such potential troubles before they actually happen.

* ### Single pattern recursion infinite loop

This is the simplest case, that occurs when the pattern is invoked inside its definition:

    p333P333qP333 => depth = 1: P333 -> (P333)

* ### Single mutual recursion infinite loop

Occurs when a pattern calls to unpack the mutual one, which contains a callback to the first:

    p1P2qp2P1qP2  => depth = 2: P2 -> P1 -> (P2)

* ### Multiple mutual recursion infinite loop

Occurs within the combo set of mutual callbacks without termination: 

    p1P2qp2P3qp3P1qP3 => depth = 3: P3 -> P1 -> P2 -> (P3)

* ### No infinite recursion: terminating branch

This happens when the program can finish without encountering an infinite loop. Meaning the depth will be considered 0. Some examples below:

    P4p4FLRq      => depth = 0
    p1P2qp2R5qP1  => depth = 0
    p1P2qp2P1q    => depth = 0 (no call)

# Task

Your interpreter should be able to analyse infinite recursion profiles in the input program, including multi-mutual cases.

Though, rather than to analyse only the first encountered infinite loop and get stuck in it like the robot would be, your code will have continue deeper in the calls to find the depth of any infinite recursion or terminating call. Then it should return the minimal and the maximal depths encountered, as an array `[min, max]`.

### About the exploration of the different possible branches of the program:

* Consider only patterns that are to be executed:

```
p1P1q                 => should return [0, 0], there is no execution
p1P2P3qp2P1qp3P1q     => similarly [0, 0]
p1P1qP1               => returns [1, 1]
```

* All patterns need to be executed, strictly left to right. Meaning that you may encounter several branches:

```
p1P2P3qp2P1qp3P1qP3   => should return [2, 3]

P3 -> P1 -> P2 -> (P1)    depth = 3 (max)
        \-> (P3)          depth = 2 (min)
```

# Input

* A valid RoboScript program, as string.
* Nested definitions of patterns, such as `p1...p2***q...q` will not be tested, even if that could be of interest as a Roboscript improvement.
* All patterns will have a unique identifier.
* Since the program is valid, you won't encounter calls to undefined pattern either.

# Output

* An array `[min, max]`, giving what are the minimal and the maximal recursion depths encountered.

### Examples
```
p1F2RF2LqP1         =>  should return [0, 0], no infinite recursion detected

p1F2RP1F2LqP1       =>  should return [1, 1], infinite recursion detection case

P2p1P2qp2P1q        =>  should return [2, 2], single mutual infinite recursion case

p1P2qP3p2P3qp3P1q   =>  should return [3, 3], twice mutual infinite recursion case

p1P2P1qp2P3qp3P1qP1 =>  should return [1, 3], mixed infinite recursion case

Your function will receive 2 arguments: a polynomial as a string, and a point to evaluate the equation as an integer.

## Assumptions:

* There will be a coefficient near each `x`, unless the coefficient equals `1` or `-1`.
* There will be an exponent near each `x`, unless the exponent equals `0` or `1`.
* All exponents will be greater or equal to zero

## Story

Before we dive into the exercise, I would like to show you why these numbers are so important in computer programming today.

It all goes back to the time of 19th century. Where computers we know today were non-existing. The first ever **computer program** was for the Analytical Engine to compute **Bernoulli numbers**. A woman named Ada Lovelace wrote the very first program. The sad part is the engine was never fully build so her code was never tested. She also predicted the start of **AI** (artificial intelligence).

Computers will be able to compose music by themselves, solve problems (not only numbers) ... So in her honor reproduce what was done back in 1842. The Bernoulli numbers are a sequence of rational numbers with deep connections to number theory. The Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli and the Japanese mathematician Seki Kowa discovered the numbers around the same time at the start of the 18th Century. If you want to read more about her or Bernoulli numbers follow these links:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BernoulliNumber.html

## Exercise

Your job is to write a function `bernoulli_number(n)` which outputs the n-th Bernoulli number. The input will always be a non-negative integer so you do not need to worry about exceptions. How you will solve the problem is none of my business but here are some guidelines.  
You can make pascal triangle and then with the basic formula generate all Bernoulli numbers. Look example below.

For the sake of floating numbers, just use `Fractions` so there will be no problems with rounding.

0 = 1 + 2b1 ............................................................... 
  b1 = - 1/2

0 = 1 + 3b1 + 3b2 ...................................................    b2        = 1/6

0 = 1 + 4b1 + 6b2 + 4b3 .......................................  b3 = 0

0 = 1 + 5b1 + 10b2 + 10b3 + 5b4 ...................... b4 = - 1/30

... and so on.

```
bernoulli_number(0) # return 1
bernoulli_number(1) # return Fraction(-1,2) or Rational(-1,2) or ""1/2""
bernoulli_number(6) # return Fraction(1,42) or ...
bernoulli_number(42) # return Fraction(1520097643918070802691,1806) or ...
bernoulli_number(22) # return Fraction(854513,138) or ... ""854513/138""
```

## Note

See ""Sample Tests"" to see the return type for each language.

Good luck and happy coding! 

PS: be careful some numbers might exceed `1000`.
If this kata is too hard for you try to solve pascal triangle and something similar to this and then come back :).

# Task
 Sorting is one of the most basic computational devices used in Computer Science. 

 Given a sequence (length ≤ 1000) of 3 different key values (7, 8, 9), your task is to find the minimum number of exchange operations necessary to make the sequence sorted. 

 One operation is the switching of 2 key values in the sequence.

# Example

 For `sequence = [7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]`, the result should be `0`.

 It's already a sorted sequence.

 For `sequence = [9, 7, 8, 8, 9, 7]`, the result should be `1`.

 We can switching `sequence[0]` and `sequence[5]`.

 For `sequence = [8, 8, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7]`, the result should be `4`.

 We can:
```
 [8, 8, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7] 
 switching sequence[0] and sequence[3]
 --> [9, 8, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7]
 switching sequence[0] and sequence[8]
 --> [7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9]
 switching sequence[1] and sequence[2]
 --> [7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9]
 switching sequence[5] and sequence[7]
 --> [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9] 
```
So `4` is the minimum number of operations for the sequence to become sorted.

 - `[input]` integer array `sequence`

  The Sequence.

 - `[output]` an integer

  the minimum number of operations.

Automatons, or Finite State Machines (FSM), are extremely useful to programmers when it comes to software design. You will be given a simplistic version of an FSM to code for a basic TCP session.

The outcome of this exercise will be to return the correct state of the TCP FSM based on the array of events given.

---------------------------------

The input array of events will consist of one or more of the following strings:

```
APP_PASSIVE_OPEN, APP_ACTIVE_OPEN, APP_SEND, APP_CLOSE, APP_TIMEOUT, RCV_SYN, RCV_ACK, RCV_SYN_ACK, RCV_FIN, RCV_FIN_ACK
```

---------------------------------

The states are as follows and should be returned in all capital letters as shown:

```
CLOSED, LISTEN, SYN_SENT, SYN_RCVD, ESTABLISHED, CLOSE_WAIT, LAST_ACK, FIN_WAIT_1, FIN_WAIT_2, CLOSING, TIME_WAIT
```

---------------------------------

The input will be an array of events. Your job is to traverse the FSM as determined by the events, and return the proper state as a string, all caps, as shown above.

If an event is not applicable to the current state, your code will return `""ERROR""`.

### Action of each event upon each state:
(the format is `INITIAL_STATE: EVENT -> NEW_STATE`)

```
CLOSED: APP_PASSIVE_OPEN -> LISTEN
CLOSED: APP_ACTIVE_OPEN  -> SYN_SENT
LISTEN: RCV_SYN          -> SYN_RCVD
LISTEN: APP_SEND         -> SYN_SENT
LISTEN: APP_CLOSE        -> CLOSED
SYN_RCVD: APP_CLOSE      -> FIN_WAIT_1
SYN_RCVD: RCV_ACK        -> ESTABLISHED
SYN_SENT: RCV_SYN        -> SYN_RCVD
SYN_SENT: RCV_SYN_ACK    -> ESTABLISHED
SYN_SENT: APP_CLOSE      -> CLOSED
ESTABLISHED: APP_CLOSE   -> FIN_WAIT_1
ESTABLISHED: RCV_FIN     -> CLOSE_WAIT
FIN_WAIT_1: RCV_FIN      -> CLOSING
FIN_WAIT_1: RCV_FIN_ACK  -> TIME_WAIT
FIN_WAIT_1: RCV_ACK      -> FIN_WAIT_2
CLOSING: RCV_ACK         -> TIME_WAIT
FIN_WAIT_2: RCV_FIN      -> TIME_WAIT
TIME_WAIT: APP_TIMEOUT   -> CLOSED
CLOSE_WAIT: APP_CLOSE    -> LAST_ACK
LAST_ACK: RCV_ACK        -> CLOSED
```

___Note for Java users:___ Due to type checking in Java, inputs and outputs are formated quite differently in this language. See the footnotes of the description.

```

You have the following lattice points with their corresponding coordinates and each one with an specific colour.

 ```
Point   [x ,  y]     Colour
----------------------------
  A     [ 3,  4]     Blue
  B     [-7, -1]     Red
  C     [ 7, -6]     Yellow
  D     [ 2,  5]     Yellow
  E     [ 1, -5]     Red
  F     [-1,  4]     Red
  G     [ 1,  7]     Red
  H     [-3,  5]     Red
  I     [-3, -5]     Blue
  J     [ 4,  1]     Blue
```
We want to count the triangles that have the three vertices with the same colour. The following picture shows the distribution of the points in the plane with the required triangles.

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/sP0l1i1.png)

The input that we will have for the field of lattice points described above is:

```
[[[3, -4], ""blue""],  [[-7, -1], ""red""], [[7, -6], ""yellow""], [[2, 5], ""yellow""],
 [[1, -5], ""red""],   [[-1, 4], ""red""],  [[1, 7], ""red""],     [[-3, 5], ""red""], 
 [[-3, -5], ""blue""], [[4, 1], ""blue""] ]
```
We see the following result from it:

```
Colour   Amount of Triangles       Triangles
Yellow         0                    -------
Blue           1                      AIJ
Red            10                   BEF,BEG,BEH,BFG,BFH,BGH,EFG,EFH,EHG,FGH
```
As we have 5 different points in red and each combination of 3 points that are not aligned.

We need a code that may give us the following information in order:

```
1) Total given points
2) Total number of colours
3) Total number of possible triangles
4) and 5) The colour (or colours, sorted alphabetically) with the highest amount of triangles
```

In Python our function will work like:

```
[10, 3, 11, [""red"",10]]) == count_col_triang([[[3, -4], ""blue""],  [[-7, -1], ""red""], [[7, -6], ""yellow""], [[2, 5], ""yellow""], 
                                              [[1, -5], ""red""],   [[-1, 4], ""red""],  [[1, 7], ""red""],     [[-3, 5], ""red""],
                                              [[-3, -5], ""blue""], [[4, 1], ""blue""] ])
```
In the following case we have some points that are aligned and we have less triangles that can be formed:

```
[10, 3, 7, [""red"", 6]] == count_col_triang([[[3, -4], ""blue""],  [[-7, -1], ""red""], [[7, -6], ""yellow""], [[2, 5], ""yellow""],
                                            [[1, -5], ""red""],   [[1, 1], ""red""],   [[1, 7], ""red""],     [[1, 4], ""red""], 
                                            [[-3, -5], ""blue""], [[4, 1], ""blue""] ])
```
Just to see the change with the previous case we have this:

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/cCgO7ql.png)

In the special case that the list of points does not generate an even single triangle, the output will be like this case:

```
[9, 3, 0, []] == count_col_triang([[[1, -2], ""red""], [[7, -6], ""yellow""], [[2, 5], ""yellow""], [[1, -5], ""red""],
                                  [[1, 1], ""red""],   [[1, 7], ""red""],     [[1, 4], ""red""],    [[-3, -5], ""blue""], 
                                  [[4, 1], ""blue""] ])
```
It will be this case:

![source: imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/VB7t7Ij.png)

If in the result we have two or more colours with the same maximum amount of triangles, the last list should be like (e.g)

```
[35, 6, 35, [""blue"", ""red"", ""yellow"", 23]]     # having the names of the colours sorted alphabetically
```
For the condition of three algined points A, B, C, you should know that the the following determinant should be 0.

```
 | xA    yA    1|
 | xB    yB    1|    = 0
 | xC    yC    1|

```
Assumptions:

- In the list you have unique points, so a point can have only one colour.

- All the inputs are valid

Enjoy it!

You are given a binary tree:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, L, R, n):
        self.left = L
        self.right = R
        self.value = n
```

Your task is to return the list with elements from tree sorted by levels, which means the root element goes first, then root children (from left to right) are second and third, and so on.
```if:ruby
Return empty array if root is `nil`.
```
```if:haskell

```
```if:python

```if:csharp
Return empty list if root is 'null'.
```
```if:java
Return empty list is root is 'null'.

Complete the function/method (depending on the language) to return `true`/`True` when its argument is an array that has the same nesting structures and same corresponding length of nested arrays as the first array.

For example:

```python
# should return True

same_structure_as([ 1, [ 1, 1 ] ], [ 2, [ 2, 2 ] ] )

# should return False 
same_structure_as([ 1, [ 1, 1 ] ], [ [ 2, 2 ], 2 ] )
same_structure_as([ 1, [ 1, 1 ] ], [ [ 2 ], 2 ] )

# should return True
same_structure_as([ [ [ ], [ ] ] ], [ [ [ ], [ ] ] ] )

# should return False
same_structure_as([ [ [ ], [ ] ] ], [ [ 1, 1 ] ] )

## Description

Given an array X of positive integers, its elements are to be transformed by running the following operation on them as many times as required:

```if X[i] > X[j] then X[i] = X[i] - X[j]```

When no more transformations are possible, return its sum (""smallest possible sum"").

For instance, the successive transformation of the elements of input X = [6, 9, 21] is detailed below:
```
X_1 = [6, 9, 12] # -> X_1[2] = X[2] - X[1] = 21 - 9
X_2 = [6, 9, 6]  # -> X_2[2] = X_1[2] - X_1[0] = 12 - 6
X_3 = [6, 3, 6]  # -> X_3[1] = X_2[1] - X_2[0] = 9 - 6
X_4 = [6, 3, 3]  # -> X_4[2] = X_3[2] - X_3[1] = 6 - 3
X_5 = [3, 3, 3]  # -> X_5[1] = X_4[0] - X_4[1] = 6 - 3
```
The returning output is the sum of the final transformation (here 9).

There are performance tests consisted of very big numbers and arrays of size at least 30000. Please write an efficient algorithm to prevent timeout.

Alex and Lee continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 
Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Initially, M = 1.
On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.  Then, we set M = max(M, X).
The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alex can get.

Example 1:
Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]
Output: 10
Explanation:  If Alex takes one pile at the beginning, Lee takes two piles, then Alex takes 2 piles again. Alex can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alex takes two piles at the beginning, then Lee can take all three piles left. In this case, Alex get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger.

1 <= piles.length <= 100
1 <= piles[i] <= 10 ^ 4

You are given a set of points in the 2D plane. You start at the point with the least X and greatest Y value, and end at the point with the greatest X and least Y value. The rule for movement is that you can not move to a point with a lesser X value as compared to the X value of the point you are on. Also for points having the same X value, you need to visit the point with the greatest Y value before visiting the next point with the same X value. So, if there are 2 points: (0,4 and 4,0) we would start with (0,4) - i.e. least X takes precedence over greatest Y. You need to visit every point in the plane.

-----Input-----
You will be given an integer t(1<=t<=20) representing the number of test cases. A new line follows; after which the t test cases are given. Each test case starts with a blank line followed by an integer n(2<=n<=100000), which represents the number of points to follow. This is followed by a new line. Then follow the n points, each being a pair of integers separated by a single space; followed by a new line. The X and Y coordinates of each point will be between 0 and 10000 both inclusive.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print the total distance traveled by you from start to finish; keeping in mind the rules mentioned above, correct to 2 decimal places. The result for each test case must be on a new line.

-----Example-----
Input:
3

Uttu got to know about an interesting two-player mobile game recently and invites his friend Gangwar to try it out with him. Gangwar, however, has been playing this game since it was out 5 years ago and is a Legendary Grandmaster at it. Uttu immediately thought of somehow cheating in this game to beat Gangwar.
But the most he could do was choose if he wanted to go ""First"" or if he wanted to go ""Second"" in this alternative turn based game. Help Uttu choose so that he will always win regardless of Gangwar's moves.Description of the game
You are playing on a continent name Tamriel. This continent have $N$ towns numbered from $1$ to $N$ where town $1$ is the capital. These towns are connected to each other by $N-1$ roads. Any two towns are connected by some series of roads, i.e., You can go from any town to any other town using these roads.
Each town $i$ some initial amout of soldiers $S_i$ in it. At every move, a player can choose a town other than the capital $i$ and move some non-zero amount of its current soldiers to a town which is one step closer towards the capital. After the first move, the moves are alternated between the players. The player who cannot make a move loses.Input
- The first line contains a single integer $N$
- The second line contains a $N$ space seperated integers denoting $S_1,S_2,\dots,S_n$
- The $N-1$ subsequent lines contain two space seperated integers $u$ and $v$, denoting that the town $u$ and town $v$ are connected by a road.Output
- Print ""First"" or ""Second"" based on what Uttu should choose to win.Constraints
- $ 2 \leq N \leq {2}\times{10}^{5}$
- $ 1 \leq S_i \leq {10}^{9}$ for each valid $i$
- $ 1 \leq u,v \leq N$Sample Input 1

Heidi is a statistician to the core, and she likes to study the evolution of marmot populations in each of V (1 ≤ V ≤ 100) villages! So it comes that every spring, when Heidi sees the first snowdrops sprout in the meadows around her barn, she impatiently dons her snowshoes and sets out to the Alps, to welcome her friends the marmots to a new season of thrilling adventures.

Arriving in a village, Heidi asks each and every marmot she comes across for the number of inhabitants of that village. This year, the marmots decide to play an April Fools' joke on Heidi. Instead of consistently providing the exact number of inhabitants P (10 ≤ P ≤ 1000) of the village, they respond with a random non-negative integer k, drawn from one of two types of probability distributions:

  Poisson (d'avril) distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is $\frac{p^{k} e^{-P}}{k !}$ for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...,  Uniform distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is $\frac{1}{2 P + 1}$ for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 2P. 

Heidi collects exactly 250 answers per village. Every village follows either the Poisson or the uniform distribution. Heidi cannot tell marmots apart, so she may query some marmots several times, and each time the marmot will answer with a new number drawn from the village's distribution.

Can you help Heidi to find out whether a village follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution?

-----Input-----

The first line of input will contain the number of villages V (1 ≤ V ≤ 100). The following V lines each describe one village. The description of each village consists of 250 space-separated integers k, drawn from one of the above distributions.

-----Output-----

Output one line per village, in the same order as provided in the input. The village's line shall state poisson if the village's distribution is of the Poisson type, and uniform if the answer came from a uniform distribution.

-----Example-----

The Dynamic Connectivity Problem

Given a set of of N objects, is there a path connecting the two objects?

Implement an class that implements the following API:

  *  Takes n as input, initializing a data-structure with N objects (0...N-1)
  *  Implements a Union command that adds a connection between point p and point q
  *  Implements a Connected command that returns a boolean and asks is there a connection between point p and point q

As a simple example: 
Imagine you initialize an data structure filled with integers from 0 to 9 (N = 10)
```python
  results1 = DynamicConnectivity(10)
```
You will receive a series of union commands linking various points
```python
  results1.union(4,3)
  results1.union(3,8)
  results1.union(6,5)
  results1.union(9,4)
  results1.union(2,1)
```
This should result in 5 groups of connections:

  * 3,4,8,9
  * 5,6
  * 2,1
  * 0
  * 7

All members of a groups (set) are conected to every other member
If you asked is 0 connected to 7, it should return False
If you asked is 8 connected to 9 you should return True even if 8,9 wern't directly joined.
(8 is connected to 3 which is connected to 4 which is connected to 9)
```python
  results1.connected(0,7) == False
  results1.connected(8,9) == True
```

For the purposes of this problem, you do not have to mainatin the order of the connections, you just have to know that the connection is there.

Hint:
  There is a naive implenetation that takes time proportional to O(n^2) (Quadratic Funtion)
  **This will time out the problem**
  (Because every time you double the input like from 50 nodes to 100 nodes, the function takes **4** times as long)
  Test will check that you are able to outrun this naive implementation. If you can't that means that your code is too slow

  There is a solution that takes linearitmic time or faster O(n * lg n)

Hint Two: (Take it or leave it)
  If you find yourself nesting a loop inside a loop, you are creating a quadratic function

Implementation must be able to handle initializing 1 million nodes, and creating connections between those nodes.

Full Tests before submission generate random connections to make sure you can't hard code the connections into your class.

The Stack Arithmetic Machine
---------------------------

This time we're going to be writing a stack arithmetic machine, and we're going to call it Sam. Essentially, Sam is a very small virtual machine, with a simple intruction set, four general registers, and a stack. We've already given a CPU class, which gives you read and write access to registers and the stack, through `readReg()` and `writeReg()`, and `popStack()` and `writeStack()` respectively. All instructions on Sam are 32-bit (Java int), and either interact with the stack, or one of the 4 registers; `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`.

The CPU API
-----------

The CPU instructions available through the CPU class, with a bit more detail:

```python
read_reg(self, name): Returns the value of the named register.
write_reg(self, name, value): Stores the value into the given register.

pop_stack(self): Pops the top element of the stack, returning the value.
write_stack(self, value): Pushes an element onto the stack.
```

Note that the registers have a default value of `0` and  that the sStack is printable (if needed).

The Instruction Set
-------------------

Instructions for same are done in assembly style, and are passed one by one into the `Exec|exec|execute` function (depending on your language). Each instruction begins with the name of the operation, and is optionally followed by either one or two operands. The operands are marked in the table below by either `[reg]`, which accepts a register name, or `[reg|int]` which accepts either a register, or an immediate integer value.

### Stack Operations

```
push [reg|int]: Pushes a register [reg] or an immediate value [int] to the stack.

pop: Pops a value of the stack, discarding the value.

pop [reg]: Pops a value of the stack, into the given register [reg].

pushr: Pushes the general registers onto the stack, in order. (a, b, c, d)

pushrr: Pushes the general registers onto the stack, in reverse order. (d, c, b, a)

popr: Pops values off the stack, and loads them into the general registers, in order so that the two executions `pushr()`  and `popr()` would leave the registers unchanged.

poprr: Pops values off the stack, and loads them into the general registers, in order so that the two executions `pushr()`  and `poprr()` would invert the values of the registers from left to right.
```

### Misc Operations

```
mov [reg|int], [reg2]: Stores the value from [reg|int] into the register [reg2].
```

### Arithmetic Operations

```
add [reg|int]: Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, storing the sum in register a.

sub [reg|int]: Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, storing the difference in register a.

mul [reg|int]: Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, storing the product in register a.

div [reg|int]: Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, storing the quotient in register a.

and [reg|int]: Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, performing a bit-and operation, and storing the result in register a.

or [reg|int] : Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, performing a bit-or operation, and storing the result in register a.

xor [reg|int]: Pops [reg|int] arguments off the stack, performing a bit-xor operation, and storing the result in register a.
```

All arithmetic operations have 4 variants; they may be suffixed with the character `'a'` (`adda`, `xora`), and they may take an additional register parameter, which is the destination register. Thus, using add as an example:
```
add 5: Adds the top 5 values of the stack, storing the result in register a.

add 5, b: Adds the top 5 values of the stack, storing the result in register b instead.

adda 5: Pushes the value of register A onto the stack, then adds the top 5 values of the stack, and stores the result in register a.

adda 5, b: Pushes the value of register A onto the stack, adds the top 5 values of the stack, and stores the result in register b.
```

All arithmetic instructions may also take a register as their first argument, to perform a variable number of operation, as follows:
```
mov 3, a: Stores the number 3 in register a.
add a: Adds the top a values of the stack (in this case 3), storing the result in register a.
```

A famous casino is suddenly faced with a sharp decline of their revenues. They decide to offer Texas hold'em also online. Can you help them by writing an algorithm that can rank poker hands? 

## Task

Create a poker hand that has a method to compare itself to another poker hand:

```python
compare_with(self, other_hand)
```

A poker hand has a constructor that accepts a string containing 5 cards:
```python
PokerHand(""KS 2H 5C JD TD"")
```

The characteristics of the string of cards are:
* Each card consists of two characters, where
 * The first character is the value of the card: `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T(en), J(ack), Q(ueen), K(ing), A(ce)`
 * The second character represents the suit: `S(pades), H(earts), D(iamonds), C(lubs)`
* A space is used as card separator between cards

The result of your poker hand compare can be one of these 3 options:

```python
[ ""Win"", ""Tie"", ""Loss"" ]
```

## Notes
* Apply the [Texas Hold'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) rules for ranking the cards.
* Low aces are **NOT** valid in this kata.
* There is no ranking for the suits.

Spider-Man (""Spidey"") needs to get across town for a date with Mary Jane and his web-shooter is low on web fluid. He travels by slinging his web rope to latch onto a building rooftop, allowing him to swing to the opposite end of the latch point.
Write a function that, when given a list of buildings, returns a list of optimal rooftop latch points for minimal web expenditure.
Input
Your function will receive an array whose elements are subarrays in the form [h,w] where h and w represent the height and width, respectively, of each building in sequence
Output
An array of latch points (integers) to get from 0 to the end of the last building in the input list
Technical Details

An optimal latch point is one that yields the greatest horizontal distance gain relative to length of web rope used. Specifically, the highest horizontal distance yield per length unit of web rope used. Give this value rounded down to the nearest integer as a distance from Spidey's origin point (0)
At the start of each swing, Spidey selects a latch point based on his current position.
At the end of each swing, Spidey ends up on the opposite side of the latch point equal to his distance from the latch point before swing.
Spidey's initial altitude is 50, and will always be the same at the start and end of each swing. His initial horizontal position is 0.
To avoid collision with people/traffic below, Spidey must maintain a minimum altitude of 20 at all times.
Building height (h) range limits: 125 <= h < 250
Building width (w) range limits: 50 <= w <= 100
Inputs will always be valid.

Test Example

- Spidey's initial position is at `0`. His first latch point is marked at `76` (horizontal position) on `buildings[0]`.
- At the end of the swing, Spidey's position is at the point marked `B` with a horizontal position of `152`. The green arc represents Spidey's path during swing.
- The marker on the 3rd building and the arc going from point `B` to point `C` represent the latch point (`258`) and arc path for the next swing.

One of the services provided by an operating system is memory management. The OS typically provides an API for allocating and releasing memory in a process's address space. A process should only read and write memory at addresses which have been allocated by the operating system. In this kata you will implement a simulation of a simple memory manager.

The language you will be using has no low level memory API, so for our simulation we will simply use an array as the process address space. The memory manager constructor will accept an array (further referred to as `memory`) where blocks of indices will be allocated later.

___

# Memory Manager Contract

## allocate(size)

`allocate` reserves a sequential block (sub-array) of `size` received as an argument in `memory`. It should return the index of the first element in the allocated block, or throw an exception if there is no block big enough to satisfy the requirements.

## release(pointer)

`release` accepts an integer representing the start of the block allocated ealier, and frees that block. If the released block is adjacent to a free block, they should be merged into a larger free block. Releasing an unallocated block should cause an exception.

## write(pointer, value)

To support testing this simulation our memory manager needs to support read/write functionality. Only elements within allocated blocks may be written to. The `write` method accepts an index in `memory` and a `value`. The `value` should be stored in `memory` at that index if it lies within an allocated block, or throw an exception otherwise.

## read(pointer)

This method is the counterpart to `write`. Only indices within allocated blocks may be read. The `read` method accepts an index. If the `index` is within an allocated block, the value stored in `memory` at that index should be returned, or an exception should be thrown otherwise.

Create a class called `Warrior` which calculates and keeps track of their level and skills, and ranks them as the warrior they've proven to be.

Business Rules:

- A warrior starts at level 1 and can progress all the way to 100.
- A warrior starts at rank `""Pushover""` and can progress all the way to `""Greatest""`.
- The only acceptable range of rank values is `""Pushover"", ""Novice"", ""Fighter"", ""Warrior"", ""Veteran"", ""Sage"", ""Elite"", ""Conqueror"", ""Champion"", ""Master"", ""Greatest""`.
- Warriors will compete in battles. Battles will always accept an enemy level to match against your own.
- With each battle successfully finished, your warrior's experience is updated based on the enemy's level.
- The experience earned from the battle is relative to what the warrior's current level is compared to the level of the enemy.
- A warrior's experience starts from 100. Each time the warrior's experience increases by another 100, the warrior's level rises to the next level.
- A warrior's experience is cumulative, and does not reset with each rise of level. The only exception is when the warrior reaches level 100, with which the experience stops at 10000
- At every 10 levels, your warrior will reach a new rank tier. (ex. levels 1-9 falls within `""Pushover""` tier, levels 80-89 fall within `""Champion""` tier, etc.)
- A warrior cannot progress beyond level 100 and rank `""Greatest""`.

Battle Progress Rules & Calculations:

- If an enemy level does not fall in the range of 1 to 100, the battle cannot happen and should return `""Invalid level""`.
- Completing a battle against an enemy with the same level as your warrior will be worth 10 experience points.
- Completing a battle against an enemy who is one level lower than your warrior will be worth 5 experience points.
- Completing a battle against an enemy who is two levels lower or more than your warrior will give 0 experience points.
- Completing a battle against an enemy who is one level higher or more than your warrior will accelarate your experience gaining. The greater the difference between levels, the more experinece your warrior will gain. The formula is `20 * diff * diff` where `diff` equals the difference in levels between the enemy and your warrior.
- However, if your warrior is at least one rank lower than your enemy, and at least 5 levels lower, your warrior cannot fight against an enemy that strong and must instead return `""You've been defeated""`.
- Every successful battle will also return one of three responses: `""Easy fight"", ""A good fight"", ""An intense fight""`. Return `""Easy fight""` if your warrior is 2 or more levels higher than your enemy's level. Return `""A good fight""` if your warrior is either 1 level higher or equal to your enemy's level. Return `""An intense fight""` if your warrior's level is lower than the enemy's level.

Logic Examples:

- If a warrior level 1 fights an enemy level 1, they will receive 10 experience points.
- If a warrior level 1 fights an enemy level 3, they will receive 80 experience points.
- If a warrior level 5 fights an enemy level 4, they will receive 5 experience points.
- If a warrior level 3 fights an enemy level 9, they will receive 720 experience points, resulting in the warrior rising up by at least 7 levels.
- If a warrior level 8 fights an enemy level 13, they will receive 0 experience points and return `""You've been defeated""`. (Remember, difference in rank & enemy level being 5 levels higher or more must be established for this.)
- If a warrior level 6 fights an enemy level 2, they will receive 0 experience points.

 Training Rules & Calculations:
- In addition to earning experience point from battles, warriors can also gain experience points from training.
- Training will accept an array of three elements (except in java where you'll get 3 separated arguments): the description, the experience points your warrior earns, and the minimum level requirement.
- If the warrior's level meets the minimum level requirement, the warrior will receive the experience points from it and store the description of the training. It should end up returning that description as well.
- If the warrior's level does not meet the minimum level requirement, the warrior doesn not receive the experience points and description and instead returns `""Not strong enough""`, without any archiving of the result.

 Code Examples:
```python
bruce_lee = Warrior()
bruce_lee.level         # => 1
bruce_lee.experience    # => 100
bruce_lee.rank          # => ""Pushover""

bruce_lee.rank          # => ""Master""

### Context and Definitions

You are in charge of developing a new cool JavaScript library that provides functionality similar to that of [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/).

You have started by adding a new  **list data type** to your library. You came up with a design of a data structure that represents an [algebraic data type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) as a pair of elements:

```python
class Cons:
  def __init__(self, head, tail):
    self.head = head
    self.tail = tail
```

You are pretty smart, because using this new data type, we can easily build a list of elements. For instance, a list of numbers:

```python
numbers = Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Cons(4, Cons(5, None)))))
```

In a code review with your boss, you explained him how every *cons cell* contains a ""value"" in its head, and in its tail it contains either another cons cell or null. We know we have reached the end of the data structure when the tail is null.

So, your boss is pretty excited about this new data structure and wants to know if you will be able to build some more  functionality around it. In a demo you did this week for the rest of your team, in order to illustrate how this works, you showed them a method to transform a list of items of your list data type into a JavaScript array:

```python
  # added to the class implementation:
  def to_array(self):
    tail = self.tail
    new_tail = (tail.to_array() if tail is not None else [])
    return [self.head] + new_tail
```

And they were amazed when you simply did this:

```python
print(numbers.to_array())  # yields [1,2,3,4,5]
```

### The New Requirements

Now, the team is convinced that this is the way to go and they would like to build the library around this cool new data type, but they want you to provide a few more features for them so that they can start using this type in solving some real world problems.

You have been reading about a technique called  [applicative programming](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/s/spobooks/bbv9810.0001.001/1:15?rgn=div1;view=fulltext) which basically consists in applying a function to every element in a list.  So, you gave it some thought and you have decided to start adding features  like **filter**, **map** and **reduce**. Basically you want to provide equivalent functionality to that of JavaScript arrays and in the future even more.

So, you will now add:

 - [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FArray%2Ffilter): create a new algebraic list containing only the elements that satisfy a predicate function. 
 - [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FArray%2Ffilter) : create a new list in which every element is the result of applying a function provided as argument.
 - fromArray:  a convenient complementary method  that creates a list out of a JavaScript array.

For this Kata, the definition of `Cons` and the prototypal/class method `toArray`/`to_array`/`into_vec` are already loaded in your environment.

### Examples of Usage

```python
numbers = Cons.from_array([1,2,3,4,5])
numbers.filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0).to_array()  # yields [2,4]
numbers.map(lambda x: x * x).to_array()  # yields [1,4,9,16,25]

digits = Cons.from_array([""1"",""2"",""3"",""4"",""5""])
integers = digits.map(int) \
                 .filter(lambda n: n > 3) \
                 .to_array()  # yields [4,5]
```

In other words:

 - The static method `Cons.fromArray` (or `from_array`, `from_iter`) produces `Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Cons 4, Cons 5, null)))))`.
  - Above filter creates a new list: `Cons(2, Cons(4, null))`.
 -  So does above map:  `Cons(1, Cos(4, Cons(9, Cons(16, Cons(25, null)))))`.

# Overview

The goal here is to solve a puzzle (the ""pieces of paper"" kind of puzzle). You will receive different pieces of that puzzle as input, and you will have to find in what order you have to rearrange them so that the ""picture"" of the puzzle is complete.

## Puzzle pieces

All the pieces of the puzzle will be represented in the following way:

* 4 numbers, grouped in 2 tuples, which are representing the ""picture"" on the piece. Every piece has a 2x2 size.
* 1 id number. All id numbers are unique in a puzzle, but their value may be random.
* Note that all numbers will be non-negative integers (except for outer border ""picture"" numbers in C#)

For example, 

    ((1, 2), (3, 4), 1) 
     Puzzle piece id ^  

is equivalent the the following square piece of puzzle, having the id number `1`:

    +---+
    |1 2|
    |3 4|
    +---+

If the piece is on a border or is a corner, some numbers will be replaced with `None` (`-1` in C#):
```python
((None, None), (1, 2), 10)       -->   upper border
((9, None), (None, None), 11)   -->   bottom right corner
```

Note that you cannot flip or rotate the pieces (_would you like to change the picture!?_)

## Solving the puzzle

* You'll get an array of pieces as well as the size of the puzzle (width and height).  
* Two pieces can be assembled if they share the same pattern on the border where they are in contact (see example below).
* Puzzle pieces being unique, you'll never encounter two different pieces that could be assembled with the same third one. So to say: borders are unique.
* Once you found the proper arrangment for all the pieces, return the solved puzzle as a list of tuples (height * width) of the id number of the piece at its correct position. (For C#, return the solved puzzle as a 2-dimensional array of integers.)

## Example:

Inputs:

```python
width, height = 3,3
pieces = [ ((None, 5), (None, None), 3), 
           ((17, None), (None, None), 9),
           ((None, 4), (None, 5), 8),
           ((4, 11), (5, 17), 5),
           ((11, None), (17, None), 2),   
           ((None, None), (None, 4), 7),
           ((5, 17), (None, None), 1), 
           ((None, None), (11, None), 4),
           ((None, None), (4, 11), 6) ]`
```

In this case, the expected output would be:

```python
expected = [(7, 6, 4), (8, 5, 2), (3, 1, 9)]
```

... the solved puzzle looking like this:

```python
         Puzzle Solved:                     Related id numbers:
 -----------------------------                  7    6    4
|None None|None None|None None|                 
|None   4 | 4    11 | 11  None|                 8    5    2
|-----------------------------|
|None   4 | 4    11 | 11  None|                 3    1    9
|None   5 | 5    17 | 17  None|
|-----------------------------| 
|None   5 | 5    17 | 17  None| 
|None None|None None|None None|
 -----------------------------
```

### Notes:

* Be careful about performances, you'll have to handle rather big puzzles.
* Width and height will be between 2 and 100 (inclusive)
* The puzzle may be rectangular too

Your task in this kata is to implement the function `create_number_class` which will take a string parameter `alphabet` and return a class representing a number composed of this alphabet.

The class number will implement the four classical arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `//`), a method to convert itself to string, and a `convert_to` method which will take another class number as parameter and will return the value of the actual class number converted to the equivalent value with tha alphabet of the parameter class (return a new instance of this one).

Example:

```python
BinClass = create_number_class('01')
HexClass = create_number_class('0123456789ABCDEF')

x = BinClass('1010')
y = BinClass('10')

print(x+y)                   => '1100'
isinstance(x+y, BinClass)    => True
print(x.convert_to(HexClass) => 'A'
```

___Notes:___

* Only positives integers will be used (either as parameters or results of calculations).
* You'll never encounter invalid calculations (divisions by zero or things like that).
* Alphabets will contain at least 2 characters.

# The learning game - Machine Learning #1
Growing up you would have learnt a lot of things like not to stand in fire, to drink food and eat water and not to jump off very tall things But Machines have it difficult they cannot learn for themselves we have to tell them what to do, why don't we give them a chance to learn it for themselves?

### Task
Your task is to finish the Machine object. What the machine object must do is learn from its mistakes! The Machine will be given a command and a number you will return a random action. After the command has returned you will be given a response (true/false) if the response is true then you have done good, if the response is false then the action was a bad one. You must program the machine to learn to apply an action to a given command using the reponse given. Note: It must take no more than 20 times to teach an action to a command also different commands can have the same action.

### Info
- In the preloaded section there is a constant called ```ACTIONS``` it is a function that returns the 5 possible actions.
- In Java, this a constant ```Actions.FUNCTIONS``` of type ```List>```. 
- In C++, the actions can be accessed by ```get_action(i)(unsigned int num)``` where i chooses the function (and therefore can range from 0 to 4) and num is its argument.
- In python ```ACTIONS()``` returns a list of lambdas.
- In Golang ```Actions()``` retruns a function slice ```[]func(int) int```

Task

Create a top-down movement system that would feel highly responsive to the player. In your Update method you have to check for the keys that are currently being pressed, the keys correspond to the enum Direction shown below, based on which key is pressed or released your method should behave this way:

1) When a key is first pressed, the player has to change his direction to that of the current key, without moving

2) If the key is still being pressed during the next Update, the player will move towards his current direction using these vectors: (Up = { 0, +1 } , Down = { 0, -1 }, Left = { -1, 0 }, Right = { +1, 0 })

3) If a new key is pressed, it will gain precedence over the previous key and the player will act as per 1)

4-A) If the current key (A) is released, then the precedence will go back to the previous key (B) (or the one before it, if (B) is not pressed anymore, and so on), then the player will behave as per 1).

4-B) If the current key is released, and no other keys are being pressed, the player will stand still

5) If all keys are released at once, the player will not move nor change direction

6) If multiple keys are pressed at once, the order of precedence will be the following { Up, Down, Left, Right } 

Examples

    (n = pressed key, [n] = current key, p() = press, r() = release, (8,2,4,6 = up, down, left, right)):

    [] , p(8) -> [8] , p(4,6) -> 86[4] , r(6) -> 8[4] , r(4) -> [8] , r(8) -> []

    [] , p(2486) -> 642[8] , r(2,8) -> 6[4] , r(4,6) -> []

This is what you'll need to use in your code (NB: the tile coordinates cannot be changed, you'll need to assign a new Tile each time the player moves):

```python
class Tile:

    @property
    def x(self):
        return self._x

    @property
    def y(self):
        return self._y

Write a class called User that is used to calculate the amount that a user will progress through a ranking system similar to the one Codewars uses.  

##### Business Rules:

* A user starts at rank -8 and can progress all the way to 8.
* There is no 0 (zero) rank. The next rank after -1 is 1.
* Users will complete activities. These activities also have ranks.
* Each time the user completes a ranked activity the users rank progress is updated based off of the activity's rank
* The progress earned from the completed activity is relative to what the user's current rank is compared to the rank of the activity
* A user's rank progress starts off at zero, each time the progress reaches 100 the user's rank is upgraded to the next level
* Any remaining progress earned while in the previous rank will be applied towards the next rank's progress (we don't throw any progress away). The exception is if there is no other rank left to progress towards (Once you reach rank 8 there is no more progression). 
* A user cannot progress beyond rank 8. 
* The only acceptable range of rank values is -8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Any other value should raise an error. 

The progress is scored like so:

* Completing an activity that is ranked the same as that of the user's will be worth 3 points
* Completing an activity that is ranked one ranking lower than the user's will be worth 1 point
* Any activities completed that are ranking 2 levels or more lower than the user's ranking will be ignored
* Completing an activity ranked higher than the current user's rank will accelerate the rank progression. The greater the difference between rankings the more the progression will be increased. The formula is `10 * d * d` where `d` equals the difference in ranking between the activity and the user.  

##### Logic Examples:
* If a user ranked -8 completes an activity ranked -7 they will receive 10 progress
* If a user ranked -8 completes an activity ranked -6 they will receive 40 progress
* If a user ranked -8 completes an activity ranked -5 they will receive 90 progress
* If a user ranked -8 completes an activity ranked -4 they will receive 160 progress, resulting in the user being upgraded to rank -7 and having earned 60 progress towards their next rank
* If a user ranked -1 completes an activity ranked 1 they will receive 10 progress (remember, zero rank is ignored)

##### Code Usage Examples:
```python
user = User()
user.rank # => -8
user.progress # => 0
user.inc_progress(-7)
user.progress # => 10
user.inc_progress(-5) # will add 90 progress
user.progress # => 0 # progress is now zero
user.rank # => -7 # rank was upgraded to -7
```

**Note**: Codewars no longer uses this algorithm for its own ranking system. It uses a pure Math based solution that gives consistent results no matter what order a set of ranked activities are completed at.

For a new 3D game that will be released, a team of programmers needs an easy function. (Then it will be processed as a method in a Class, forget this concept for Ruby)

We have an sphere with center O, having in the space the coordinates `[α, β, γ]` and radius `r`  and a list of points, `points_list`, each one with coordinates `[x, y, z]`. Select the biggest triangle (or triangles) that has (have) all its (their) 3 vertice(s) as interior points of the sphere (not even in the sphere contour). You should consider that a point P is interior if its distance to center O, d, is such that:

d < r

and 

(d - r) / r| > 10^(-10)

Let's see the situation with the following points in the image posted below:
```python
A = [1,2,-4]; B = [-3, 2, 4]; C = [7, 8, -4]; D = [2, 3, 5]; E = [-2, -1, 1]
```

The sphere has the following features:
```
O = [1, 2, -2] (Center of the sphere)
radius = 8
```

As C is the only exterior point of the sphere, the possible triangles that have their vertices interior to the sphere are: 

```
ABD, ABE, ADE, BDE
```

Let's see which is the biggest one:

```python
Triangle    Triangle with its points         Area
ABD        [[1,2,-4],[-3,2,4],[2,3,5]]    22.44994432064
ABE        [[1,2,-4],[-3,2,4],[-2,-1,1]]  13.56465996625
ADE        [[1,2,-4],[2,3,5],[-2,-1,1]]   22.62741699796 <---- biggest triangle
BDE        [[-3,2,4],[2,3,5],[-2,-1,1]]   11.31370849898
```

Our function ```biggest_triang_int()``` (javascript: ```biggestTriangInt()```should output for this case:

```python
points_list = [[1,2,-4], [-3, 2, 4], [7, 8, -4], [2, 3, 5], [-2, -1, 1]]
sphere_center = [1, 2, -2]
radius = 8
biggest_triang_int(points_list, sphere_center, radius) == [4, 22.62741699796,  [[1,2,-4],[2,3,5],[-2,-1,1]]]
```

That means that with the given points list we may generate 4 triangles with all their vertices as interior points of the sphere, the biggest triangle has an area of 22.62741699796 (the units does not matter and the values for the area should not be rounded) and finally, there is only one triangle with this maximum value.
Every triangle should be output having the same order of its vertices than in the given list of points. B = [-3,2,4], comes before than D =[2,3,5] and the last one E = [-2,-1,1]
If in the result we have only one triangle, the function should output a list of three points.

Let'see the next case:

```python
points_list = [[1,2,-4], [-3, 2, 4], [7, 8, -4], [2, 3, 5], [-2, -1, 1],
              [3, 2, 6], [1, 4, 0], [-4, -5, -6], [4, 5, 6], [-2, -3, -5],
              [-1, -2, 4], [-3, -2, -6], [-1, -4, 0], [2, 1, -1]]
sphere_center = [0, 0, 0]
radius = 8
biggest_triang_int(points_list, sphere_center, radius) == [165, 33.645207682521445, [[[1, 2, -4], [3, 2, 6], [-1, -4, 0]], [[1, 4, 0], [-1, -2, 4], [-3, -2, -6]]]]
```

Now there are a total of 165 triangles with their vertices in the sphere, the biggest triangle has an area of 33.645207682521445 but we have two triangles with this area value. The vertices of each triangle respect the order of the points list as we expressed before but the additional detail is that the triangles are sorted by the values of the coordinates of their points. Let's compare the coordinates of the first point

```
First point   x  y  z
Triangle1     1  2 -4  <--- this triangle is first in the result
Triangle2     1  4  0
              |  |
              |  y1 < y2 (2, 4)
              |
              x1 = x2     (1 = 1)
```

In the case that all the given points are exterior to the sphere the function should output the empty list.

The points in the list are all valid and each one occurs once.

Remember that if three points are collinear do not form a triangle. For practical purposes you may consider that if the area of a triangle is lower than 10^(-8), the points are aligned.

Enjoy it!

# Deducing information

When things can be implied from given information, it should be done.

For instance, a parent's gender can be determined as soon as the other parent's gender becomes known:

```python
fam = Family()
fam.set_parent_of(""Vera"", ""George"")
fam.set_parent_of(""Vera"", ""Vanessa"")
fam.female(""Vanessa"")
fam.female(""George"");  # False, because:
fam.is_male(""George""); # ...this is True.
```

~~~if:javascript,java,php
Also `setParentOf` can return `false`. For example, if the relationship would infer that one becomes their own ancestor:
~~~
~~~if:python
Also `set_parent_of` can return `False`. For example, if the relationship would infer that one becomes their own ancestor:
~~~

```python
fam = Family()
fam.set_parent_of(""Vera"", ""George"")
fam.set_parent_of(""George"", ""Vera"") # False
```

# Details, rules, assumptions

Although the task relates to genealogy, the rules of this kata are not claimed to be realistic. Several simplifications and rules apply, which may not hold in real life: 

- Strings are case sensitive, but there are no tests playing around with ""Peter"", ""PETER"" and ""PeTeR"".
- People are uniquely identified by their name. For instance, there are no two different people called ""Jim"" in the same family.
- Once a person has an assigned gender, it cannot be changed.
- No gender conclusions should be made from personal names: ""Bob"" could well be a woman and ""Susan"" a man.
- People cannot have more than one mother and one father.
- The terms ""parents"" and ""children"" refer to the relatives in the immediate previous/next generations only, not to more remote ancestors or descendants.
- Incest may occur, so, for example, one's parent may at the same time be their grandparent.
- One cannot be their own ancestor.
- Age is not accounted for. Even if some incestuous relationships would infer that one's parent is more than 5 generations older, it should be allowed.
- In case a name's first occurrence is in a call of one of the two gender querying methods, the return value will always be false, as that new person does not have a known gender.
- In case a name's first occurrence is in a call of one of the two relation querying methods, the return value will always be an empty array/list, as there are no relationships known yet in which that new person participates.
- For the reasons in the preceding two bullet points it should not matter whether you actually store that name in these cases in your data structure, or not. In the latter case you would only store it at the next occasion when that name is mentioned in a call of one of the three other methods, that actually *add* information. The described interface has no way to query the difference between these two possible implementations, so you can choose freely.

# Example

Consider the following family graph:

# Let's play some games!

A new RPG called **_Demon Wars_** just came out! Imagine the surprise when you buy it after work, go home, start you _GameStation X_ and it happens to be too difficult for you. Fortunately, you consider yourself a computer connoisseur, so you want to build an AI that tells you every step you have to make to **defeat the evil Demon Lord** and win the game. For now, let's program a simulator.

This game features procedurally generated stages like this one:

  Health: ♥️ ♥️ ♥️   Atk: 1   Def: 1   Bag: []  
K   E     |    X#        C      E   S#  D  
    E     #######               ###### E E 
##### #####                          ###-##
     M                                 EEE 
                     ###   ###             
                     #       ##E##E##      
     ^               #          C  K#      
               C      #   H   ##E##E##       

As you can see in the upper status bar, your player starts with **three Health Points**, **1 Attack**, **1 Defense** and an empty **Bag**. These are the only stats that you have to care about for the game. As for the map, we can see many different things, so let's explain every tile one by one:
* `^` or `v` or `<` or `>` => **Player** (you). It can face any of four directions.
* `#` => **Wall**. You cannot pass through here.
* `C` => **Coin _[object]_**.
* `M` => **Merchant**. They will go away if you give them **three coins**.
* `K` => **Key _[object]_**. They can open a door, after which they break _(yes, like in horror games)_.
* `-` and `|` => **Doors** _(there are two doors in the map above)_.
* `H` => **Health Potion _[object]_**. It refuels your life to three hearts.
* `S` => **Shield**. It gives **+1 defense** permanently.
* `X` => **Dual Swords**. It gives **+1 attack** permanently.
* `E` => **Enemy**. Has **1 Health Point** and **2 Attack**.
* `D` => **Demon Lord**. Has **10 Health Points** and **3 Attack**. You win the game if you kill him.

Now, _Demon Wars_ is a turn based game with tank controls. Each turn you can either:
* Move forward.
* Change direction.
* Use an item.
* Attack the enemy you have in front of you.

Will you be able to defeat your foe and save us all?

---------------------

# Attack mechanics and enemies

When you use the attack command, you will attack the enemy right in front of you and deal **the same amount of damage as your attack stat**:

 E                         E
>E    === [Attack] ==>    > 
 E                         E

**However**, an enemy can attack you (whatever your orientation is), as long as you are on an adjacent cell to the enemy (vertically or horizontally, not diagonally) and if one of those conditions is fullfilled:

* If you turn your character during the turn.
* If you move away from them (_D&D's opportunity attack_ :D).
* If you use a potion. You will still recover your life points, but then you will be attacked.

The damage formula is `max(0, (Enemy's attack stat) - (Your defense stat))`. Just remember that you attack and use objects **before** the enemies besides you attack. Here is an example where two enemies would attack you:

EEE                        EEE
 >E    === [Attack] ==>     > 
EEE                        EEE

But enemies are more than obstacles, each time you defeat three of them (demon lord not included), you level up! This level increase will give you **+1 attack** permanently.

# Object usage mechanics

There are only three cases where it is acceptable to use objects:
* When you use a key in front of a closed door.

 #                          #
>|    === [Use Key] ==>    > 
 #                          #

* When you use a coin in front of a merchant (repeat three times for them to go away).

>M  === [Use Coin] ==>  >M  === [Use Coin] ==>  >M  === [Use Coin] ==> > 

* When you refuel your life using a potion (you must have suffered some damage).

Any other object usage is considered **invalid**. Also, this is more or less standard, but you have to walk over an object to pick it up automatically.

---------------------

# Your task

Write a function `rpg(field: List[List[str]], actions: List[str]) -> Tuple[List[List[str]], int, int, int, List[str]]` that takes the initial state of the game map and a list of actions and returns the new state of the map and the player after executing them in order. All these actions must be valid (no using objects in invalid spots, attacking thin air, going out of bounds, etc), so if any of them turns out not to be valid, return `None`. **Dying counts as an invalid state**.

The order of the elements of the output tuple is: (`new map state`, `health`, `attack`, `defense`, `sorted bag`)

The syntax of the actions is as follows:
* `F` to move forward.
* `^`, `>`, `v` and `<`to rotate the player.
* `A` to attack the enemy you have in front of you.
* `C`, `K` and `H` to use a coin, a key and a health potion, respectively.

**Technical notes:** 
* You **can** mutate the input (and probably should), but it is not necessary.
* There will only be one Demon Lord per map, but every other tile may be repeated two or even more times.
* Only the tiles marked as **[object]** will be stored in your bag (i.e. keys, coins and potions).
* Only valid inputs will be given.

----------------

As always, I hope you have fun with this kata :)

This kata is inspired by Tower Defense (TD), a subgenre of strategy video games where the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing enemy attackers, usually by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack.

Objective
It's the future, and hostile aliens are attacking our planet. We've set up a defense system in the planet's outer perimeter. You're tasked with calculating the severity of a breach.
Input
Your function will receive three arguments:

Battle Area Map: An array/list of strings representing an n x n battle area.
        Each string will consist of any of the following characters:

0: entrance point (starting position on alien path)
1: alien path
"" ""(space character): not alien path
A - Z: turret positions

Turret Stats: An object/dict where keys are upper-case characters from the English alphabet (A - Z) and the values are subarrays in the following format:
[n,m] - where n is the attack range of a turret, and m is its shot frequency per move
Alien Wave Stats: An array of integers representing each individual alien in sequence. Each value is an integer representing the health points of each alien; health points are the number of turret shots required to take down a given alien. Integer zero (0) counts as a gap in sequence.

Output
Return the integer sum of total health points of all aliens that successfully penetrate our defense.

The image above shows the game state for the test example (below) at the 11th move.
The green square in the north-west quadrant represents the starting position of the alien wave, and the red square in the south-east quadrant represents the last position before breaching the defensive perimeter.
The blue circles represent the turret positions and are labeled A,B,C, and D.
The red alien is the first alien in the sequence.
Technical Details

There is only one path and it maintains a width of 1.
Aliens move one square per turn
Turrets only fire toward enemies in range.
        In the image above, the turret labeled A has the value [3,2], meaning it can fire at aliens that occupy any position within 3 squares' length in Euclidean distance (the pink squares). Turret A will fire 2 times per move.
        The turret labeled D with the value [1,3] can fire at targets that enter the square above it and the square to the right of it (the blue shaded squares) at a rate of 3 times per move.
Turret target priority is toward the enemy within shooting range that is furthest along on the path.
        In the image above, turret A will target the red alien because it is the alien furthest along the path that is also within shooting range. This reduces the alien's health from 8 to 6.
        The next alien will die from damage taken from turret B, which reduced its health from 4 to 0.

Turret shooting timing: All turrets with a target will fire their first shot in alphabetical order. The remaining turrets that still have more shots available will fire their next shot in alphabetical order once again. This repeats until there are no more shots to fire. This marks the end of the move.
Matrix size: n x n where 20 >= n >= 7
Alien list max length: 80
Full Test Suite: 10 Fixed Tests, 100 Random Tests
Input will always be valid.

Test Example

```python
battlefield = [
        '0111111',
        '  A  B1',
        ' 111111',
        ' 1     ',
        ' 1C1111',
        ' 111 D1',
        '      1'
]
turrets = {'A':[3,2],'B':[1,4],'C':[2,2],'D':[1,3]}
wave = [30,14,27,21,13,0,15,17,0,18,26]
tower_defense(battlefield,turrets,wave); #10
'''
The aliens that survive are the alien at wave[7] with an ending health of 2
and the alien at wave[8] with an ending health of 8.'''

You are in the capital of Far, Far Away Land, and you have heard about this museum where the royal family's crown jewels are on display. Before you visit the museum, a friend tells you to bring some extra money that you'll need to bribe the guards. You see, he says, the crown jewels are in one of 10 rooms numbered from 1 to 10. The doors to these room are kept closed, and each is guarded by a very intimidating guard.

For security purposes, the jewels are moved every night to a different room. To find out which room they are in, you'll have to ask one of the guards. But first you have to pay him a bribe. After paying him:

  1. If the jewels are behind the door he's guarding, he'll let you in.
  2. Otherwise, he'll point you in the direction of the correct room by telling you if the room has a higher or lower room number than the room he's guarding.

The guards have a special rank system, and, depending on rank, the size of the bribe that you'll need to pay to each guard may vary. For example, you may have to pay $1 to the guard at room 1, $2 to the guard at room 2, and so on, up to $10 to the guard at room 10. The bribe amounts are specified by an array/list sorted by room number in ascending order. Hence, in this example, the bribes are given by `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

The problem you need to solve is to determine the minimum amount you may need _in the worst case_ to get into the room with the crown jewels. As a seasoned programmer, you might try doing a binary search. Let's assume that the bribes are as specified in the example above. You first go to the guard standing in front of room 5, and pay him $5. In the worst case the crown jewels are in room 10 and you'll end up paying: $5 + $8 + $9 + $10 = $32. It turns out that a regular binary search is not optimal in this case. You are better off if you first go to room 7. In the worst case the guard will direct you to the right(i.e., higher numbered rooms) and then you go to room 9. Again, in the worst case the guard will direct you to the right, and you go to room 10. In all, you'll have to pay $7 + $9 + $10 = $26. You can easily verify that if the first guard (at room 7) had directed you to the left, you would have ended up paying less than $26. So for this problem, the maximum you will need to pay is $26. There are no other solutions where you would need less in the worst case, so 26 is the solution to this problem instance. 

You are asked to define function `least_bribes(bribes)` that takes as argument an array that contains the bribes that each guard will accept in ascending room number and returns the minumum amount you'll need to spend on bribes _in the worst case_. The problem is not limited to 10 rooms only, so the array `bribes` can be of any length greater or equal to 1. Your code will have to handle arrays up to 100 in length and bribes between $1 and $1000.

A group of N golfers wants to play in groups of G players for D days in such a way that no golfer plays more than once with any other golfer. For example, for N=20, G=4, D=5, the solution at Wolfram MathWorld is

```
 Mon:   ABCD    EFGH    IJKL    MNOP    QRST
 Tue:   AEIM    BJOQ    CHNT    DGLS    FKPR
 Wed:   AGKO    BIPT    CFMS    DHJR    ELNQ
 Thu:   AHLP    BKNS    CEOR    DFIQ    GJMT
 Fri:   AFJN    BLMR    CGPQ    DEKT    HIOS
```

Write a function that validates a proposed solution, a list of list of strings, as being a solution to the social golfer problem. Each character represents a golfer, and each string is a group of players. Rows represent days. The solution above would be encoded as:

```
 [
  ['ABCD', 'EFGH', 'IJKL', 'MNOP', 'QRST'],
  ['AEIM', 'BJOQ', 'CHNT', 'DGLS', 'FKPR'],
  ['AGKO', 'BIPT', 'CFMS', 'DHJR', 'ELNQ'],
  ['AHLP', 'BKNS', 'CEOR', 'DFIQ', 'GJMT'],
  ['AFJN', 'BLMR', 'CGPQ', 'DEKT', 'HIOS']
 ]
```

You need to make sure (1) that each golfer plays exactly once every day, (2) that the number and size of the groups is the same every day, and (3) that each player plays with every other player *at most* once.

So although each player must play every day, there can be particular pairs of players that never play together.

It is not necessary to consider the case where the number of golfers is zero; no tests will check for that. If you do wish to consider that case, note that you should accept as valid all possible solutions for zero golfers, who (vacuously) can indeed play in an unlimited number of groups of zero.

We all know how to handle exceptions in Python. Just use:

    try:
        num = float(input())
    except ValueError:
        print(""That's not a number!"")
    else:
        print(num)

Code such as this

    def factorial(x, n = 1):
        if x == 0:
          raise ValueError(n)
        factorial(x - 1, n * x)

relies on ridiculous exception misuse, but you can't change it because that would require a complete refactor. Code such as this

    try:
        return int(input(""Input a number: "")
    except ValueError:
        return 4 # random number

relies on reasonable exception use - almost all of the Python documentation examples are written in this way.

What if you are using a faulty implementation of Embedded Python that doesn't implement the `try` statement? Where `sys.excepthook` is a hard-coded, unoverrideable value? Where even `__file__` is not defined? How do you use basic functions like `list.index`?

Your task is to write a function that can handle exceptions raised in a program or function _without_ using `try` or `except`. Somehow.

The first argument of your function `handle` will be a `lambda` requiring no parameters. You will call this function and handle any exceptions raised. The second argument will be a callable `success`:

    def success(func, val):
        pass

The third argument will be a callable `failure`:

    def failure(func, exc):
        pass

Subsequent arguments will be exceptions. If instances of these exceptions are raised, you must call the handler and no error message must be printed to `stderr`. If the exception raised is not provided as an argument, it should appear as though the exception was never caught.

Pass the return value of `func` to `success` unless it raises an exception. If it raises an exception that `isinstance` of an exception class passed to `handle`, call `failure` with an instance of the raised exception.

Don't worry about the little things like dealing with the extra arguments to exceptions or maintaining the call stack. Whoever writes code like _that_ deserves the extra work.

## What does ""catching an exception"" mean?
It means:

  * The exception will not be printed to `stderr`.
  * Code can continue to be executed.
  * The `failure` callable knows what the exception was.

## A Knight's Tour

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour

Traditional chess boards are 8x8 grids, but for this kata we are interested in generating tours for any square board sizes.

You will be asked to find a knight's path for any NxN board from any start position.

I have provided a tool to visualize the output of your code at the following link: http://jsfiddle.net/7sbyya59/2/

EDIT: The expected output is a 2D array `(n x 2)` comprised of the `[x,y]` coordinates of the Knight's path taken in sequential order. (e.g. `[[2,3],[4,4],...,[x,y]]`)

All test cases will have a passing solution.

_yet another easy kata!_

_Bored of usual python katas? me too;_

## Overview

     As you have guessed from the title of the kata you are going to implement a class that supports ***function overloading***. You might be thinking python doesn't support that thing... Of course python doesn't support that! So you have to implement that missing functionality.

     To achieve that You have to implement the `Meta` class which will be the metaclass of `Overload` class (see sample tests) and class that use `Meta` should work as usual at other things.

## The Goal

```python

class Overload(metaclass=Meta):

    CLS_VAR = 42

    def __init__(self):
        self.a = 1
        self.no = 'This is ""No parameter"" function.'
        self.single = 'This is ""Single parameter"" function'
        self.two = 'This is ""Two parameter"" function'
        self.three = 'This is ""Three parameter"" function'

    def foo(self):
        return self.no

    def foo(self, x):
        return self.single + ':' + str(x)

    def foo(self, x, y):
        return self.two + ':' + str(x) + ',' + str(y)

    def foo(self, x, y, z):
        return self.three + ':' + str(x) + ',' + str(y) + ',' + str(z)

    def extra(self):
        return 'This is extra method.'

  obj = Overload()

  Overload.foo=lambda self,a,b,c,d: 'from outside!'

  obj.foo()            # 'This is ""No parameter"" function.'
  obj.foo(1, 2)        # 'This is ""Two parameter"" function:1,2'
  obj.foo(1, 2, 3)     # 'This is ""Three parameter"" function:1,2,3'
  obj.foo(1, 2, 3, 4)  # 'from outside!'
```

## Specifications

   * The Overload base class will always be the same as above. It will be regenerated different times in the tests, for testing purpose.
   * All the other methods will be added and tested **after instanciation** the class like shown in the example above (***Focus on this point; you will need this***).
   * Only instance methods will be tested, no static or class level methods.
   * There is no testing for either `*varargs` or `**kwargs`.
   * Aside from overloading, the class should behave just like usual. Talking here about variable assginment or reassignment, at class or instance level, reassigning a method to a var or the opposite, ...
   * If there is neither a method (overloaded or not) which satisfies the expected number of arguments nor a property or class level property that cn be found when calling for an attribute, raise an exception of type `AttributeError` (""just like usual"", as said above...)
   * Last but not least, different classes must not share overloaded method. Hence:

```python
Cls1 = generate_Overload()
obj = Cls1()
Cls1.foo=lambda self,a,b,c,d: 'from Cls1'

Cls2 = generate_Overload()
obj2 = Cls2()
Cls2.foo=lambda self,a,b,c,d: 'from Cls2'

obj.foo(1,2,3,4)    # -> 'from Cls1'
obj2.foo(1,2,3,4)   # -> 'from Cls2'

Cls2.foo=lambda self: 'updated'

obj.foo()           # -> 'This is ""No parameter"" function.'
obj2.foo()          # -> 'updated'
```

## Notes

   * If there are any flaw in testing then report me.
   * If you need some hints then ping me in discourse.

_Enjoy!_

_Thanks to B4B for his contribution._

_I can assure you that this can be done without using any library/modules._

# Task

You are given a `chessBoard`, a 2d integer array that contains only `0` or `1`. `0` represents a chess piece and `1` represents a empty grid. It's always square shape.

Your task is to count the number of squares made of empty grids.

The smallest size of the square is `2 x 2`. The biggest size of the square is `n x n`, where `n` is the size of chess board. 

A square can overlap the part of other squares. For example:

If

```
chessBoard=[
  [1,1,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [1,1,1]
]
```

...there are four 2 x 2 squares in the chess board:

```
[1,1, ]  [ ,1,1]  [ , , ]  [ , , ]
[1,1, ]  [ ,1,1]  [1,1, ]  [ ,1,1]
[ , , ]  [ , , ]  [1,1, ]  [ ,1,1]
```

And one 3 x 3 square:
```
[1,1,1]
[1,1,1]
[1,1,1]
```

Your output should be an object/dict. Each item in it should be: `size:number`, where size is the square's size, and number is the number of squares. 

For example, if there are four `2 x 2` squares and one `3 x 3` square in the chess board, the output should be: `{2:4,3:1}` (or any equivalent hash structure in your language). The order of items is not important, `{3:1,2:4}` is also a valid output.

If there is no square in the chess board, just return `{}`.

# Note

```if:javascript
- `2 <= chessBoard.length <= 400`
```
```if:python
- `2 <= chessBoard.length <= 120`
```
```if:ruby
- `2 <= chessBoard.length <= 130`
```
```if:java
- `2 <= chessBoard.length <= 250`
```
```if:haskell
- `2 <= chessBoard.length <= 120`
```
```if:csharp
- `2 <= chessBoard.Length <= 220`
```

- `5` fixed testcases

- `100` random testcases, testing for correctness of solution

- `100` random testcases, testing for performance of code

- All inputs are valid.

- Pay attention to code performance.

- If my reference solution gives the wrong result in the random tests, please let me know(post an issue). 

# Example

For 
```
chessBoard = [
  [1,1],
  [1,1]
]
```

the output should be `{2:1}`.

For 
```
chessBoard = [
  [0,1],
  [1,1]
]
```

the output should be `{}`.

For 
```
chessBoard = [
  [1,1,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [1,1,1]
]
```

the output should be `{2:4,3:1}`.

For 
```
chessBoard = [
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,1]
]
```

the output should be `{}`.

# On a business trip, again...

I love traveling, just like everyone else. If only they were not business trips... They force me to go to places I don't want to go and listen to people that I don't care about. But, by far, the thing I hate the most is **packing my bag**.

The thing is, I can only carry one bag in the plane and I **NEED** to bring some important items. Every item is numbered and has a specific shape. Here is an example of a well-sorted bag:

11112233
14444233
14442223

Will I be able to fit all the items I need in the bag?

# Your task

Write a funtion `fit_bag(height: int, width: int, items: List[List[List[int]]]) -> List[List[int]]` that takes a bag height and width and a list of items and returns a bag with all the items in a correct place.

The pieces will be given as a square bidimensional array that represents items as follows:

1111
1
1

 → 

[
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0]
]

4444
444

 → 

[
  [4, 4, 4, 4],
  [4, 4, 4, 0],
]

And, as you may have guessed, the output is represented the same way as the pieces, but it will contain the numbers of all the pieces and zeroes in the case of empty spaces. The thing is, **you cannot rotate the pieces nor flip them**.

4444
444

 → 

4
44
44
44

 ✖ 

**Technical notes:**
* Items will only contain zeroes (for empty spaces) and another number that identifies the item.
* Items will not have rows or columns of zeros at the borders. If an item's matrix is of size *n*x*m*, this means the object has a bounding box of *n*x*m*.
* There will be no two items with the same number.
* There will never be more than 9 items.
* Items do not necessarily have to be one connected component.
* The only condition for your solution to be valid is that there has to be at least one instance of each requested item. There can be empty spaces (represented by zeroes) or repeated items.
* Every test case **is solvable**.

# Preloaded code

You are given two functions for debugging purposes:

* `only_show_wrong()`: disable the bag print of the test cases that you solved successfully. Use this only once at the beginning or your code.
* `print_bag(bag)`: this function prints a bag in a human-readable format for debugging purposes. It is done by default in every test case unless it is disabled.

# Tests

Here are the tests that will be done:
* **Fixed tests (respectively):** bags of sizes 3x8, 3x6, 3x5, 3x7, 3x8 and 5x9. Six tests of each with 4 to 8 items.
* **Random tests:** 300 5x9 bags tests with 7 to 9 items.

The Vigenère cipher is a classic cipher originally developed by Italian cryptographer Giovan Battista Bellaso and published in 1553. It is named after a later French cryptographer Blaise de Vigenère, who had developed a stronger autokey cipher (a cipher that incorporates the message of the text into the key). 

The cipher is easy to understand and implement, but survived three centuries of attempts to break it, earning it the nickname ""le chiffre indéchiffrable"" or ""the indecipherable cipher.""

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher):

> The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
>
> . . .
>
> In a Caesar cipher, each letter of the alphabet is shifted along some number of places; for example, in a Caesar cipher of shift `3`, `A` would become `D`, `B` would become `E`, `Y` would become `B` and so on. The Vigenère cipher consists of several Caesar ciphers in sequence with different shift values.

Assume the key is repeated for the length of the text, character by character. Note that some implementations repeat the key over characters only if they are part of the alphabet -- **this is not the case here.**

The shift is derived by applying a Caesar shift to a character with the corresponding index of the key in the alphabet.

Visual representation:
Write a class that, when given a key and an alphabet, can be used to encode and decode from the cipher.

## Example
Any character not in the alphabet must be left as is. For example (following from above):

The height of the skyscrapers is between 1 and 4
No two skyscrapers in a row or column may have the same number of floors
A clue is the number of skyscrapers that you can see in a row or column from the outside
Higher skyscrapers block the view of lower skyscrapers located behind them

The Challenge
-------------
You'll need to implement a simple lexer type. It should take in an input string through the constructor (or the parameter, for Javascript), and break it up into typed-tokens (in python, C# and Java, you'll have to manage `null/None` input too, resulting in the same behavior than an empty string). You'll need to implement the necessary methods (aaccording to your language) to make the Simplexer object behave like an iterator, Meaning that it returns a token (assuming one is available) object each time it a `next` (`Current` field in C#) method would be called. If no tokens are available, an exception should be thrown (idealy: `StopIteration` in python, `InvalidOperationException` in C# and `NoSuchElementException` in Java).

Tokens are represented by Token objects, which define two properties as strings: `text`, and `type`. Constructor is `Token(text, type)`.

**C# Notes**:
`Iterator` is an extension of `IEnumerator` with default implementations for `Reset()`, `Dispose()` and `IEnumerator.Current` as these are not need to pass the challenge. You only need to override `MoveNext()` and `Current { get; }`.

Token Types
-----------
There are 7 tokens types that your lexer will need to produce: `identifier`, `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `keyword`, `operator`, and `whitespace`. To create the token, you'd need to pass in the token value (the text) and the token type as strings, so for example, a simple integer token could be created with `new Token(""1"", ""integer"")` (Note: no default values or default constructor are provided, so use `new Token("""","""")` if you want a default Token object).

Token Grammar
--------------
Here's a table of the grammars for the various token types:
```
integer : Any sequence of one or more digits.

boolean : true or false.

string : Any sequence of characters surrounded by ""double quotes"".

operator : The characters +, -, *, /, %, (, ), and =.

keyword : The following are keywords: if, else, for, while, return, func, and break.

whitespace : Matches standard whitespace characters (space, newline, tab, etc.)
Consecutive whitespace characters should be matched together.

identifier : Any sequence of alphanumber characters, as well as underscore and dollar sign,
and which doesn't start with a digit. Make sure that keywords aren't matched as identifiers!
```

[Currying and partial application](http://www.2ality.com/2011/09/currying-vs-part-eval.html) are two ways of transforming a function into another function with a generally smaller arity. While they are often confused with each other, they work differently. The goal is to learn to differentiate them.

## Currying

> Is the technique of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments in such a way that it can be called as a chain of functions each with a single argument.

Currying takes a function:

```
f: X × Y → R
```

and turns it into a function:

```
f': X → (Y → R)
```

Instead of calling `f` with two arguments, we invoke `f'` with the first argument. The result is a function that we then call with the second argument to produce the result. Thus, if the uncurried `f` is invoked as:

```
f(3, 5)
```

then the curried `f'` is invoked as:

`f'(3)(5)`

### Example

Given this function:

```python
def add(x, y, z):
  return x + y + z
```

We can call in a normal way:

```python
add(1, 2, 3) # => 6
```

But we can create a curried version of `add(a, b, c)`function:

```python
curriedAdd = lambda a: (lambda b: (lambda c: add(a,b,c)))
curriedAdd(1)(2)(3) # => 6
```

## Partial application

> Is the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity.

Partial application takes a function:

```
f: X × Y → R
```

and a fixed value `x` for the first argument to produce a new function

```
f': Y → R
```

`f'` does the same as `f`, but only has to fill in the second parameter which is why its arity is one less than the arity of `f`. One says that the first argument is bound to `x`.

### Example

```python
partialAdd = lambda a: (lambda *args: add(a,*args))
partialAdd(1)(2, 3) # => 6
```

-------------

Your work is to implement a generic `curryPartial()` function allows either currying or partial application.

For example:

```python
curriedAdd = curryPartial(add)
curriedAdd(1)(2)(3) # => 6

partialAdd = curryPartial(add, 1)
partialAdd(2, 3) # => 6
```

We want the function be very flexible.

All these examples should produce the same result:

```python
curryPartial(add)(1)(2)(3) # =>6 
curryPartial(add, 1)(2)(3) # =>6 
curryPartial(add, 1)(2, 3) # =>6 
curryPartial(add, 1, 2)(3) # =>6 
curryPartial(add, 1, 2, 3) # =>6 
curryPartial(add)(1, 2, 3) # =>6 
curryPartial(add)(1, 2)(3) # =>6 
curryPartial(add)()(1, 2, 3) # =>6 
curryPartial(add)()(1)()()(2)(3) # =>6 

curryPartial(add)()(1)()()(2)(3, 4, 5, 6) # =>6 
curryPartial(add, 1)(2, 3, 4, 5) # =>6 
```

And also all of these:

```python
curryPartial(curryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1), 2), 3) # =>6
curryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1, 2), 3) # =>6
curryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1), 2, 3) # =>6
curryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1), 2)(3) # =>6
curryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1)(2), 3) # =>6
curryPartial(curryPartial(curryPartial(add, 1)), 2, 3) # =>6
```

A ""graph"" consists of ""nodes"", also known as ""vertices"". Nodes may or may not be connected with one another. 
In our definition below the node ""A0"" is connected with the node ""A3"", but ""A0"" is not connected with ""A1"".

The connecting line between two nodes is called an edge. If the edges between the nodes are undirected, 
the graph is called an undirected graph. A weighted graph is a graph in which a number (the weight) is assigned to each edge.
A graph is acyclic if it has no loop.

A graph can be represented as a dictionary:

`graph = {'A0': [('A3', 1), ('A5', 4)], 
 'A1': [('A2', 2)], 
 'A2': [('A1', 1), ('A2', 2), ('A3', 1), ('A4', 1)],
 'A3': [('A0', 1), ('A2', 1)], 
 'A4': [('A2', 1), ('A4', 1)], 
 'A5': [('A3', 3)]
}`

Here the nodes are A0...A5; following each nodes is the edges list of linked nodes with their weight.
A0 is linked to A3 with a weight of 1 and to A5 with weight 4. A dictionary is not ordered but the list
of linked nodes is sorted. So: 

`'A0': [('A3', 1), ('A5', 4)]`is correct but `'A0': [('A5', 4), ('A3', 1)]`is not.

The edges E of a graph G induce a binary relation that is called the adjacency relation of G.
One can associate an adjacency matrix:

`M = 
[[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 4], 
 [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0], 
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]]`

Let us imagine that lines are numbered from A0 to A5 and the same for columns.
The first line correspond to A0 and we can see that A0 is connected to A3 with weight 1, A0 is also connected to A5 with weight 4.

Another way is to use an adjacency list: An adjacency list representation for a graph 
associates each vertex in the graph with the collection of its neighboring edges:

`L = [['A0', [('A3', 1), ('A5', 4)]], 
     ['A1', [('A2', 2)]], 
     ['A2', [('A1', 1), ('A2', 2), ('A3', 1), ('A4', 1)]], 
     ['A3', [('A0', 1), ('A2', 1)]], 
     ['A4', [('A2', 1), ('A4', 1)]], 
     ['A5', [('A3', 3)]]] `

L is sorted in order A0 to A5 and each sublist is sorted as in a graph dictionary.

In the kata nodes will be numbered from A0 to A(n-1) for a graph with n nodes. 
The task is to go from each represention to each other one
and at last to find *all* paths from a node to another node.

Below is a skeleton for our class `Graph`.

class Graph():

    def __init__(self, vertices_num):
        # number of nodes (an integer)
        self.v = vertices_num
        # (maybe not useful here) : list of nodes from ""A0"", ""A1"" ... to ""A index (vertices_num - 1)""
        self.nodes = None

    def mat_2_list(self, mat):

    # from adjacency list to adjacency matrix
    def list_2_mat(self, lst):

    # find all paths from node start_vertex to node end_vertex
    def find_all_paths(self, graph, start_vertex, end_vertex):

# Examples: 
- see: graph, M, L above.
- finding all paths:

`dct = {'A3': [('A0', 1), ('A2', 1)], 'A0': [('A3', 1), ('A2', 1)], 'A4': [('A2', 1)], 'A1': [('A2', 1)], 'A2': [('A1', 1), ('A2', 1), ('A3', 1), ('A4', 1)]}`

`g = Graph(5)`

`g.find_all_paths(dct, ""A0"", ""A4"") return l = ['A0-A2-A4', 'A0-A3-A2-A4']`

Note that ['A0-A2-A4', 'A0-A3-A2-A4'] is sorted (hint: sorted(sorted(l, key=str), key=len))

Translators and critics are welcome.

There are n people, each person has a unique id between 0 and n-1. Given the arrays watchedVideos and friends, where watchedVideos[i] and friends[i] contain the list of watched videos and the list of friends respectively for the person with id = i.
Level 1 of videos are all watched videos by your friends, level 2 of videos are all watched videos by the friends of your friends and so on. In general, the level k of videos are all watched videos by people with the shortest path exactly equal to k with you. Given your id and the level of videos, return the list of videos ordered by their frequencies (increasing). For videos with the same frequency order them alphabetically from least to greatest. 

Example 1:

Input: watchedVideos = [[""A"",""B""],[""C""],[""B"",""C""],[""D""]], friends = [[1,2],[0,3],[0,3],[1,2]], id = 0, level = 1
Output: [""B"",""C""]

Person with id = 1 -> watchedVideos = [""C""] 
Person with id = 2 -> watchedVideos = [""B"",""C""] 
The frequencies of watchedVideos by your friends are: 
B -> 1 
C -> 2

In a forest, each rabbit has some color. Some subset of rabbits (possibly all of them) tell you how many other rabbits have the same color as them. Those answers are placed in an array.

Return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

Examples:
Input: answers = [1, 1, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The two rabbits that answered ""1"" could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit than answered ""2"" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered ""2"" was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.

Input: answers = [10, 10, 10]
Output: 11

Write a class StockSpanner which collects daily price quotes for some stock, and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.
The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards) for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.
For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85], then the stock spans would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].

Example 1:
Input: [""StockSpanner"",""next"",""next"",""next"",""next"",""next"",""next"",""next""], [[],[100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]
Output: [null,1,1,1,2,1,4,6]
Explanation: 
First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:
S.next(100) is called and returns 1,
S.next(80) is called and returns 1,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(70) is called and returns 2,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(75) is called and returns 4,
S.next(85) is called and returns 6.

Note that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices
(including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.

Note:

Calls to StockSpanner.next(int price) will have 1 <= price <= 10^5.
There will be at most 10000 calls to StockSpanner.next per test case.
There will be at most 150000 calls to StockSpanner.next across all test cases.

We have a sequence of books: the i-th book has thickness books[i][0] and height books[i][1].
We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have total width shelf_width.
We choose some of the books to place on this shelf (such that the sum of their thickness is <= shelf_width), then build another level of shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down.  We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.
Note again that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.  For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.
Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner.

Example 1:

Input: books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelf_width = 4
Output: 6
Explanation:
The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.

Given the root of a binary tree, each node has a value from 0 to 25 representing the letters 'a' to 'z': a value of 0 represents 'a', a value of 1 represents 'b', and so on.
Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.
(As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller: for example, ""ab"" is lexicographically smaller than ""aba"".  A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.)

Example 1:

Input: [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]
Output: ""dba""

Example 2:

Input: [25,1,3,1,3,0,2]
Output: ""adz""

Example 3:

Input: [2,2,1,null,1,0,null,0]
Output: ""abc""

Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.
Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.

Example 1:

Input: [""i"", ""love"", ""leetcode"", ""i"", ""love"", ""coding""], k = 2
Output: [""i"", ""love""]
Explanation: ""i"" and ""love"" are the two most frequent words.
    Note that ""i"" comes before ""love"" due to a lower alphabetical order.

Example 2:

Input: [""the"", ""day"", ""is"", ""sunny"", ""the"", ""the"", ""the"", ""sunny"", ""is"", ""is""], k = 4
Output: [""the"", ""is"", ""sunny"", ""day""]
Explanation: ""the"", ""is"", ""sunny"" and ""day"" are the four most frequent words,
    with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

Note:

You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
Input words contain only lowercase letters.

Given a rooted binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.
Recall that:

The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
The depth of the root of the tree is 0, and if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d+1.
The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: 
The deepest leaves are the nodes with values 2 and 3.
The lowest common ancestor of these leaves is the node with value 1.
The answer returned is a TreeNode object (not an array) with serialization ""[1,2,3]"".

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [4]

Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]

Starting with an undirected graph (the ""original graph"") with nodes from 0 to N-1, subdivisions are made to some of the edges.
The graph is given as follows: edges[k] is a list of integer pairs (i, j, n) such that (i, j) is an edge of the original graph,
and n is the total number of new nodes on that edge. 
Then, the edge (i, j) is deleted from the original graph, n new nodes (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) are added to the original graph,
and n+1 new edges (i, x_1), (x_1, x_2), (x_2, x_3), ..., (x_{n-1}, x_n), (x_n, j) are added to the original graph.
Now, you start at node 0 from the original graph, and in each move, you travel along one edge. 
Return how many nodes you can reach in at most M moves.

Example 1:
Input: edges = [[0,1,10],[0,2,1],[1,2,2]], M = 6, N = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: 
The nodes that are reachable in the final graph after M = 6 moves are indicated below.

Example 2:
Input: edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,6],[0,2,8],[1,3,1]], M = 10, N = 4
Output: 23

Note:

0 <= edges.length <= 10000
0 <= edges[i][0] < edges[i][1] < N
There does not exist any i != j for which edges[i][0] == edges[j][0] and edges[i][1] == edges[j][1].
The original graph has no parallel edges.
0 <= edges[i][2] <= 10000
0 <= M <= 10^9
1 <= N <= 3000

Given the root of a binary tree, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.
Return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree.
A node is called the deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.
The subtree of a node is tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
Notice that nodes 5, 3 and 2 contain the deepest nodes in the tree but node 2 is the smallest subtree among them, so we return it.

Example 2:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree.

Example 3:
Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The deepest node in the tree is 2, the valid subtrees are the subtrees of nodes 2, 1 and 0 but the subtree of node 2 is the smallest.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 500].
The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time.

insert(val): Inserts an item val to the set if not already present.
remove(val): Removes an item val from the set if present.
getRandom: Returns a random element from current set of elements. Each element must have the same probability of being returned.

Example:

// Init an empty set.
RandomizedSet randomSet = new RandomizedSet();

// Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomSet.insert(1);

// Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomSet.remove(2);

// Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomSet.insert(2);

// getRandom should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomSet.getRandom();

// Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomSet.remove(1);

// 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomSet.insert(2);

// Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom always return 2.

Given a binary tree root, a ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:

Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
If the current direction is right then move to the right child of the current node otherwise move to the left child.
Change the direction from right to left or right to left.
Repeat the second and third step until you can't move in the tree.

Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).
Return the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,1,1,1,null,null,1,1,null,1,null,null,null,1,null,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (right -> left -> right).

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,1,1,null,1,null,null,1,1,null,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (left -> right -> left -> right).

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0

Constraints:

Each tree has at most 50000 nodes..
Each node's value is between [1, 100].

Implement the class TweetCounts that supports two methods:
1. recordTweet(string tweetName, int time)

Stores the tweetName at the recorded time (in seconds).

2. getTweetCountsPerFrequency(string freq, string tweetName, int startTime, int endTime)

Returns the total number of occurrences for the given tweetName per minute, hour, or day (depending on freq) starting from the startTime (in seconds) and ending at the endTime (in seconds).
freq is always minute, hour or day, representing the time interval to get the total number of occurrences for the given tweetName.
The first time interval always starts from the startTime, so the time intervals are [startTime, startTime + delta*1>,  [startTime + delta*1, startTime + delta*2>, [startTime + delta*2, startTime + delta*3>, ... , [startTime + delta*i, min(startTime + delta*(i+1), endTime + 1)> for some non-negative number i and delta (which depends on freq).

tweetCounts.getTweetCountsPerFrequency(""minute"", ""tweet3"", 0, 59); // return [2]. The frequency is per minute (60 seconds), so there is one interval of time: 1) [0, 60> - > 2 tweets.
tweetCounts.getTweetCountsPerFrequency(""minute"", ""tweet3"", 0, 60); // return [2, 1]. The frequency is per minute (60 seconds), so there are two intervals of time: 1) [0, 60> - > 2 tweets, and 2) [60,61> - > 1 tweet.
tweetCounts.recordTweet(""tweet3"", 120);                            // All tweets correspond to ""tweet3"" with recorded times at 0, 10, 60 and 120.

We are given the head node root of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.
Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.
(Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)
Example 1:
Input: [1,null,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,0,null,1]

Explanation: 
Only the red nodes satisfy the property ""every subtree not containing a 1"".
The diagram on the right represents the answer.

Example 2:
Input: [1,0,1,0,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,1,null,1]

Example 3:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0]

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the ""root."" Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that ""all houses in this place forms a binary tree"". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1

Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

Example 2:

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

       The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
       The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
       Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:

Input:
    2
   / \
  1   3
Output: true

Example 2:

    5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6
Output: false
Explanation: The input is: [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]. The root node's value
             is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

Given a binary tree with the following rules:

root.val == 0
If treeNode.val == x and treeNode.left != null, then treeNode.left.val == 2 * x + 1
If treeNode.val == x and treeNode.right != null, then treeNode.right.val == 2 * x + 2

Now the binary tree is contaminated, which means all treeNode.val have been changed to -1.
You need to first recover the binary tree and then implement the FindElements class:

FindElements(TreeNode* root) Initializes the object with a contamined binary tree, you need to recover it first.
bool find(int target) Return if the target value exists in the recovered binary tree.

Example 1:

Input
[""FindElements"",""find"",""find""]
[[[-1,null,-1]],[1],[2]]
Output
[null,false,true]
Explanation
FindElements findElements = new FindElements([-1,null,-1]); 
findElements.find(1); // return False 
findElements.find(2); // return True 
Example 2:

Input
[""FindElements"",""find"",""find"",""find""]
[[[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]],[1],[3],[5]]
Output
[null,true,true,false]
Explanation
FindElements findElements = new FindElements([-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]);
findElements.find(1); // return True
findElements.find(3); // return True
findElements.find(5); // return False
Example 3:

Input
[""FindElements"",""find"",""find"",""find"",""find""]
[[[-1,null,-1,-1,null,-1]],[2],[3],[4],[5]]
Output
[null,true,false,false,true]

findElements.find(2); // return True
findElements.find(3); // return False
findElements.find(4); // return False
findElements.find(5); // return True

Constraints:

Given a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes values.
For each node at position (X, Y), its left and right children respectively will be at positions (X-1, Y-1) and (X+1, Y-1).
Running a vertical line from X = -infinity to X = +infinity, whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing Y coordinates).
If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller.
Return an list of non-empty reports in order of X coordinate.  Every report will have a list of values of nodes.

Example 1:

Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation: 
Without loss of generality, we can assume the root node is at position (0, 0):
Then, the node with value 9 occurs at position (-1, -1);
The nodes with values 3 and 15 occur at positions (0, 0) and (0, -2);
The node with value 20 occurs at position (1, -1);
The node with value 7 occurs at position (2, -2).

Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation: 
The node with value 5 and the node with value 6 have the same position according to the given scheme.
However, in the report ""[1,5,6]"", the node value of 5 comes first since 5 is smaller than 6.

Note:

The tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.
Each node's value will be between 0 and 1000.

Storekeeper is a game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse trying to get them to target locations.
The game is represented by a grid of size m x n, where each element is a wall, floor, or a box.
Your task is move the box 'B' to the target position 'T' under the following rules:

Player is represented by character 'S' and can move up, down, left, right in the grid if it is a floor (empy cell).
Floor is represented by character '.' that means free cell to walk.
Wall is represented by character '#' that means obstacle  (impossible to walk there). 
There is only one box 'B' and one target cell 'T' in the grid.
The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box. This is a push.
The player cannot walk through the box.

Return the minimum number of pushes to move the box to the target. If there is no way to reach the target, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[""#"",""#"",""#"",""#"",""#"",""#""],

We run a preorder depth first search on the root of a binary tree.
At each node in this traversal, we output D dashes (where D is the depth of this node), then we output the value of this node.  (If the depth of a node is D, the depth of its immediate child is D+1.  The depth of the root node is 0.)
If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.
Given the output S of this traversal, recover the tree and return its root.

Example 1:

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an ancestor of B.
(A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.)

Example 1:

Input: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.

Note:

The number of nodes in the tree is between 2 and 5000.
Each node will have value between 0 and 100000.

Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.
Return the smallest level X such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level X is maximal.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So what is the most frequent subtree sum value? If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

Examples 1
Input:

  5
 /  \
2   -3

return [2, -3, 4], since all the values happen only once, return all of them in any order.

Examples 2
Input:

  5
 /  \
2   -5

return [2], since 2 happens twice, however -5 only occur once.

Note:
You may assume the sum of values in any subtree is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

Given the root of a binary tree, consider all root to leaf paths: paths from the root to any leaf.  (A leaf is a node with no children.)
A node is insufficient if every such root to leaf path intersecting this node has sum strictly less than limit.
Delete all insufficient nodes simultaneously, and return the root of the resulting binary tree.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,-99,-99,7,8,9,-99,-99,12,13,-99,14], limit = 1

We are given a list schedule of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.

Example 1:

Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation:
There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.

Example 2:

Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]

(Even though we are representing Intervals in the form [x, y], the objects inside are Intervals, not lists or arrays.  For example, schedule[0][0].start = 1, schedule[0][0].end = 2, and schedule[0][0][0] is not defined.)

Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:

Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.

Given the root of a binary tree, then value v and depth d, you need to add a row of nodes with value v at the given depth d. The root node is at depth 1. 

The adding rule is: given a positive integer depth d, for each NOT null tree nodes N in depth d-1, create two tree nodes with value v as N's left subtree root and right subtree root. And N's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root, its original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root. If depth d is 1 that means there is no depth d-1 at all, then create a tree node with value v as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.

Example 1:

Input: 
A binary tree as following:
       4
     /   \
    2     6

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n×n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

Example:

Input: 4
Output: [
 ["".Q.."",  // Solution 1
  ""...Q"",
  ""Q..."",
  ""..Q.""],

 [""..Q."",  // Solution 2
  ""Q..."",
  ""...Q"",
  "".Q..""]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.

Given a (singly) linked list with head node root, write a function to split the linked list into k consecutive linked list ""parts"".

The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than 1.  This may lead to some parts being null.

The parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal parts occurring later.

Return a List of ListNode's representing the linked list parts that are formed.

Examples
1->2->3->4, k = 5 // 5 equal parts
[ [1], 
[2],
[3],
[4],
null ]

Example 1:

Input: 
root = [1, 2, 3], k = 5
Output: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
Explanation:
The input and each element of the output are ListNodes, not arrays.
For example, the input root has root.val = 1, root.next.val = 2, \root.next.next.val = 3, and root.next.next.next = null.
The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.
The last element output[4] is null, but it's string representation as a ListNode is [].

Example 2:

Input: 
root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], k = 3
Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]
Explanation:
The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.

Note:
The length of root will be in the range [0, 1000].
Each value of a node in the input will be an integer in the range [0, 999].
k will be an integer in the range [1, 50].

Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.
After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).
Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   
             course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .

Example 2:

Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both     
             courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 
             So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .

Note:

       The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
       You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

Create a timebased key-value store class TimeMap, that supports two operations.
1. set(string key, string value, int timestamp)

Stores the key and value, along with the given timestamp.

2. get(string key, int timestamp)

Returns a value such that set(key, value, timestamp_prev) was called previously, with timestamp_prev <= timestamp.
If there are multiple such values, it returns the one with the largest timestamp_prev.
If there are no values, it returns the empty string ("""").

Example 1:
Input: inputs = [""TimeMap"",""set"",""get"",""get"",""set"",""get"",""get""], inputs = [[],[""foo"",""bar"",1],[""foo"",1],[""foo"",3],[""foo"",""bar2"",4],[""foo"",4],[""foo"",5]]
Output: [null,null,""bar"",""bar"",null,""bar2"",""bar2""]
Explanation:   
TimeMap kv;   
kv.set(""foo"", ""bar"", 1); // store the key ""foo"" and value ""bar"" along with timestamp = 1   
kv.get(""foo"", 1);  // output ""bar""   
kv.get(""foo"", 3); // output ""bar"" since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 ie ""bar""   
kv.set(""foo"", ""bar2"", 4);   
kv.get(""foo"", 4); // output ""bar2""   
kv.get(""foo"", 5); //output ""bar2""   

Example 2:
Input: inputs = [""TimeMap"",""set"",""set"",""get"",""get"",""get"",""get"",""get""], inputs = [[],[""love"",""high"",10],[""love"",""low"",20],[""love"",5],[""love"",10],[""love"",15],[""love"",20],[""love"",25]]
Output: [null,null,null,"""",""high"",""high"",""low"",""low""]

Note:

All key/value strings are lowercase.
All key/value strings have length in the range [1, 100]
The timestamps for all TimeMap.set operations are strictly increasing.
1 <= timestamp <= 10^7

You have an infinite number of stacks arranged in a row and numbered (left to right) from 0, each of the stacks has the same maximum capacity.
Implement the DinnerPlates class:

DinnerPlates(int capacity) Initializes the object with the maximum capacity of the stacks.
void push(int val) Pushes the given positive integer val into the leftmost stack with size less than capacity.
int pop() Returns the value at the top of the rightmost non-empty stack and removes it from that stack, and returns -1 if all stacks are empty.
int popAtStack(int index) Returns the value at the top of the stack with the given index and removes it from that stack, and returns -1 if the stack with that given index is empty.

Example:

A transaction is possibly invalid if:

the amount exceeds $1000, or;
if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.

Each transaction string transactions[i] consists of comma separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.
Given a list of transactions, return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid.  You may return the answer in any order.

Given a nested list of integers represented as a string, implement a parser to deserialize it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Note:
You may assume that the string is well-formed:

String is non-empty.
String does not contain white spaces.
String contains only digits 0-9, [, - ,, ].

Example 1:

Given s = ""324"",

You should return a NestedInteger object which contains a single integer 324.

Example 2:

Given s = ""[123,[456,[789]]]"",

Return a NestedInteger object containing a nested list with 2 elements:

1. An integer containing value 123.
2. A nested list containing two elements:

Implement the StreamChecker class as follows:

StreamChecker(words): Constructor, init the data structure with the given words.
query(letter): returns true if and only if for some k >= 1, the last k characters queried (in order from oldest to newest, including this letter just queried) spell one of the words in the given list.

Example:
StreamChecker streamChecker = new StreamChecker([""cd"",""f"",""kl""]); // init the dictionary.
streamChecker.query('a');          // return false
streamChecker.query('b');          // return false
streamChecker.query('c');          // return false
streamChecker.query('d');          // return true, because 'cd' is in the wordlist
streamChecker.query('e');          // return false
streamChecker.query('f');          // return true, because 'f' is in the wordlist
streamChecker.query('g');          // return false
streamChecker.query('h');          // return false
streamChecker.query('i');          // return false
streamChecker.query('j');          // return false
streamChecker.query('k');          // return false
streamChecker.query('l');          // return true, because 'kl' is in the wordlist

There is a sale in a supermarket, there will be a discount every n customer.
There are some products in the supermarket where the id of the i-th product is products[i] and the price per unit of this product is prices[i].
The system will count the number of customers and when the n-th customer arrive he/she will have a discount on the bill. (i.e if the cost is x the new cost is x - (discount * x) / 100). Then the system will start counting customers again.
The customer orders a certain amount of each product where product[i] is the id of the i-th product the customer ordered and amount[i] is the number of units the customer ordered of that product.
Implement the Cashier class:

Cashier(int n, int discount, int[] products, int[] prices) Initializes the object with n, the discount, the products and their prices.
double getBill(int[] product, int[] amount) returns the value of the bill and apply the discount if needed. Answers within 10^-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree.  n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.
Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x.  The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.
Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)
If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.  If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.
You are the second player.  If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true.  If it is not possible, return false.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The second player can choose the node with value 2.

Given two strings representing two complex numbers.

You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition.

Example 1:

Input: ""1+1i"", ""1+1i""
Output: ""0+2i""
Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.

Example 2:

Input: ""1+-1i"", ""1+-1i""
Output: ""0+-2i""
Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.

Note:

The input strings will not have extra blank.
The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form.

A kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.
The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.
Successor(x, curOrder):
    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:
        if x is the king return null
        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)
    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder

For example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.

In the beginning, curOrder will be [""king""].
Calling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice""].
Calling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack""].
Calling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].
Calling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].

Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.
Implement the ThroneInheritance class:

ThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.
void birth(string parentName, string childName) Indicates that parentName gave birth to childName.
void death(string name) Indicates the death of name. The death of the person doesn't affect the Successor function nor the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as dead.
string[] getInheritanceOrder() Returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.

Example 1:
Input
[""ThroneInheritance"", ""birth"", ""birth"", ""birth"", ""birth"", ""birth"", ""birth"", ""getInheritanceOrder"", ""death"", ""getInheritanceOrder""]
[[""king""], [""king"", ""andy""], [""king"", ""bob""], [""king"", ""catherine""], [""andy"", ""matthew""], [""bob"", ""alex""], [""bob"", ""asha""], [null], [""bob""], [null]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, [""king"", ""andy"", ""matthew"", ""bob"", ""alex"", ""asha"", ""catherine""], null, [""king"", ""andy"", ""matthew"", ""alex"", ""asha"", ""catherine""]]

Explanation
ThroneInheritance t= new ThroneInheritance(""king""); // order: king

t.birth(""king"", ""bob""); // order: king > andy > bob
t.birth(""king"", ""catherine""); // order: king > andy > bob > catherine

Given a wordlist, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query word into a correct word.
For a given query word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes:

Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.

Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""YellOw"": correct = ""yellow""
Example: wordlist = [""Yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""Yellow""
Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""yellow""

Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.

Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yollow"": correct = ""YellOw""
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yeellow"": correct = """" (no match)
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yllw"": correct = """" (no match)

In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence rules:

When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), you should return the same word back.
When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty string.

Given some queries, return a list of words answer, where answer[i] is the correct word for query = queries[i].

Example 1:
Input: wordlist = [""KiTe"",""kite"",""hare"",""Hare""], queries = [""kite"",""Kite"",""KiTe"",""Hare"",""HARE"",""Hear"",""hear"",""keti"",""keet"",""keto""]
Output: [""kite"",""KiTe"",""KiTe"",""Hare"",""hare"","""","""",""KiTe"","""",""KiTe""]

Note:

1 <= wordlist.length <= 5000
1 <= queries.length <= 5000
1 <= wordlist[i].length <= 7
1 <= queries[i].length <= 7
All strings in wordlist and queries consist only of english letters.

We are given a linked list with head as the first node.  Let's number the nodes in the list: node_1, node_2, node_3, ... etc.
Each node may have a next larger value: for node_i, next_larger(node_i) is the node_j.val such that j > i, node_j.val > node_i.val, and j is the smallest possible choice.  If such a j does not exist, the next larger value is 0.
Return an array of integers answer, where answer[i] = next_larger(node_{i+1}).
Note that in the example inputs (not outputs) below, arrays such as [2,1,5] represent the serialization of a linked list with a head node value of 2, second node value of 1, and third node value of 5.

Example 1:
Input: [2,1,5]
Output: [5,5,0]

Example 2:
Input: [2,7,4,3,5]
Output: [7,0,5,5,0]

Example 3:
Input: [1,7,5,1,9,2,5,1]
Output: [7,9,9,9,0,5,0,0]

Note:

1 <= node.val <= 10^9 for each node in the linked list.
The given list has length in the range [0, 10000].

We are given two arrays A and B of words.  Each word is a string of lowercase letters.
Now, say that word b is a subset of word a if every letter in b occurs in a, including multiplicity.  For example, ""wrr"" is a subset of ""warrior"", but is not a subset of ""world"".
Now say a word a from A is universal if for every b in B, b is a subset of a. 
Return a list of all universal words in A.  You can return the words in any order.

Example 1:
Input: A = [""amazon"",""apple"",""facebook"",""google"",""leetcode""], B = [""e"",""o""]
Output: [""facebook"",""google"",""leetcode""]

Example 2:
Input: A = [""amazon"",""apple"",""facebook"",""google"",""leetcode""], B = [""l"",""e""]
Output: [""apple"",""google"",""leetcode""]

Example 3:
Input: A = [""amazon"",""apple"",""facebook"",""google"",""leetcode""], B = [""e"",""oo""]
Output: [""facebook"",""google""]

Example 4:
Input: A = [""amazon"",""apple"",""facebook"",""google"",""leetcode""], B = [""lo"",""eo""]

Example 5:
Input: A = [""amazon"",""apple"",""facebook"",""google"",""leetcode""], B = [""ec"",""oc"",""ceo""]
Output: [""facebook"",""leetcode""]

Note:

You have a very large square wall and a circular dartboard placed on the wall. You have been challenged to throw darts into the board blindfolded. Darts thrown at the wall are represented as an array of points on a 2D plane. 
Return the maximum number of points that are within or lie on any circular dartboard of radius r.

Example 1:

Input: points = [[-2,0],[2,0],[0,2],[0,-2]], r = 2

We are given the root node of a maximum tree: a tree where every node has a value greater than any other value in its subtree.
Just as in the previous problem, the given tree was constructed from an list A (root = Construct(A)) recursively with the following Construct(A) routine:

If A is empty, return null.
Otherwise, let A[i] be the largest element of A.  Create a root node with value A[i].
The left child of root will be Construct([A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]])
The right child of root will be Construct([A[i+1], A[i+2], ..., A[A.length - 1]])
Return root.

Note that we were not given A directly, only a root node root = Construct(A).
Suppose B is a copy of A with the value val appended to it.  It is guaranteed that B has unique values.
Return Construct(B).

Example 1:

Input: root = [4,1,3,null,null,2], val = 5
Output: [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]
Explanation: A = [1,4,2,3], B = [1,4,2,3,5]

We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup (250ml) of champagne.

Then, some champagne is poured in the first glass at the top.  When the top most glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has it's excess champagne fall on the floor.)

For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.

Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the j-th glass in the i-th row is (both i and j are 0 indexed.)

Example 1:
Input: poured = 1, query_glass = 1, query_row = 1
Output: 0.0
Explanation: We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty.

Example 2:
Input: poured = 2, query_glass = 1, query_row = 1
Output: 0.5
Explanation: We poured 2 cups of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There is one cup of excess liquid. The glass indexed as (1, 0) and the glass indexed as (1, 1) will share the excess liquid equally, and each will get half cup of champange.

Note:

       poured will be in the range of [0, 10 ^ 9].
       query_glass and query_row will be in the range of [0, 99].

You have a browser of one tab where you start on the homepage and you can visit another url, get back in the history number of steps or move forward in the history number of steps.
Implement the BrowserHistory class:

BrowserHistory(string homepage) Initializes the object with the homepage of the browser.
void visit(string url) Visits url from the current page. It clears up all the forward history.
string back(int steps) Move steps back in history. If you can only return x steps in the history and steps > x, you will return only x steps. Return the current url after moving back in history at most steps.
string forward(int steps) Move steps forward in history. If you can only forward x steps in the history and steps > x, you will forward only x steps. Return the current url after forwarding in history at most steps.

Example:
Input:
[""BrowserHistory"",""visit"",""visit"",""visit"",""back"",""back"",""forward"",""visit"",""forward"",""back"",""back""]

Print a binary tree in an m*n 2D string array following these rules: 

The row number m should be equal to the height of the given binary tree.
The column number n should always be an odd number.
The root node's value (in string format) should be put in the exactly middle of the first row it can be put. The column and the row where the root node belongs will separate the rest space into two parts (left-bottom part and right-bottom part). You should print the left subtree in the left-bottom part and print the right subtree in the right-bottom part. The left-bottom part and the right-bottom part should have the same size. Even if one subtree is none while the other is not, you don't need to print anything for the none subtree but still need to leave the space as large as that for the other subtree. However, if two subtrees are none, then you don't need to leave space for both of them. 
Each unused space should contain an empty string """".
Print the subtrees following the same rules.

Example 1:

Input:
     1
    /

Given a string S of digits, such as S = ""123456579"", we can split it into a Fibonacci-like sequence [123, 456, 579].
Formally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list F of non-negative integers such that:

0 <= F[i] <= 2^31 - 1, (that is, each integer fits a 32-bit signed integer type);
F.length >= 3;
and F[i] + F[i+1] = F[i+2] for all 0 <= i < F.length - 2.

Also, note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.
Return any Fibonacci-like sequence split from S, or return [] if it cannot be done.
Example 1:
Input: ""123456579""
Output: [123,456,579]

Example 2:
Input: ""11235813""
Output: [1,1,2,3,5,8,13]

Example 3:
Input: ""112358130""
Output: []
Explanation: The task is impossible.

Example 4:
Input: ""0123""
Output: []
Explanation: Leading zeroes are not allowed, so ""01"", ""2"", ""3"" is not valid.

Example 5:
Input: ""1101111""
Output: [110, 1, 111]
Explanation: The output [11, 0, 11, 11] would also be accepted.

Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Input: [1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

Example 2:

Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
    4
   / \
  9   0
 / \
5   1
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

Design a stack which supports the following operations.
Implement the CustomStack class:

CustomStack(int maxSize) Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack or do nothing if the stack reached the maxSize.
void push(int x) Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack hasn't reached the maxSize.
int pop() Pops and returns the top of stack or -1 if the stack is empty.
void inc(int k, int val) Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val. If there are less than k elements in the stack, just increment all the elements in the stack.

Example 1:

Implement a magic directory with buildDict, and search methods.

For the method buildDict, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to build a dictionary.

For the method search, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you modify exactly one character into another character in this word, the modified word is in the dictionary you just built.

Example 1:

Input: buildDict([""hello"", ""leetcode""]), Output: Null
Input: search(""hello""), Output: False
Input: search(""hhllo""), Output: True
Input: search(""hell""), Output: False
Input: search(""leetcoded""), Output: False

Note:

You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think about highly efficient algorithm after the contest.
Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see here for more details.

Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.
A Skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists.
For example: we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:

Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons
You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add , erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).
To be specific, your design should include these functions:

bool search(int target) : Return whether the target exists in the Skiplist or not.
void add(int num): Insert a value into the SkipList. 
bool erase(int num): Remove a value in the Skiplist. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.

See more about Skiplist : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list
Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

Example:
Skiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();

skiplist.add(1);
skiplist.add(2);
skiplist.add(3);
skiplist.search(0);   // return false.
skiplist.add(4);
skiplist.search(1);   // return true.
skiplist.erase(0);    // return false, 0 is not in skiplist.
skiplist.erase(1);    // return true.
skiplist.search(1);   // return false, 1 has already been erased.

Constraints:

At most 50000 calls will be made to search, add, and erase.

Consider a directed graph, with nodes labelled 0, 1, ..., n-1.  In this graph, each edge is either red or blue, and there could be self-edges or parallel edges.
Each [i, j] in red_edges denotes a red directed edge from node i to node j.  Similarly, each [i, j] in blue_edges denotes a blue directed edge from node i to node j.
Return an array answer of length n, where each answer[X] is the length of the shortest path from node 0 to node X such that the edge colors alternate along the path (or -1 if such a path doesn't exist).

We are also given the list G, a subset of the values in the linked list.
Return the number of connected components in G, where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.
Example 1:
Input:

The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as marked red in the picture.

Example 2:
Input:

Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.
After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.

(Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of ListNode objects.)
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
Output: [3,1]
Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]

Example 3:
Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
Output: [1]

Constraints:

The given linked list will contain between 1 and 1000 nodes.
Each node in the linked list has -1000 <= node.val <= 1000.

Limak is a little bear who loves to play. Today he is playing by destroying block towers. He built n towers in a row. The i-th tower is made of h_{i} identical blocks. For clarification see picture for the first sample.

Limak will repeat the following operation till everything is destroyed.

Block is called internal if it has all four neighbors, i.e. it has each side (top, left, down and right) adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation Limak destroys all boundary blocks. His paws are very fast and he destroys all those blocks at the same time.

Limak is ready to start. You task is to count how many operations will it take him to destroy all towers.

-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n space-separated integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_{n} (1 ≤ h_{i} ≤ 10^9) — sizes of towers.

-----Output-----

Print the number of operations needed to destroy all towers.

A permutation p of size n is the sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, consisting of n distinct integers, each of them is from 1 to n (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n).

A lucky permutation is such permutation p, that any integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) meets this condition p_{p}_{i} = n - i + 1.

You have integer n. Find some lucky permutation p of size n.

-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the required permutation size.

-----Output-----

Print ""-1"" (without the quotes) if the lucky permutation p of size n doesn't exist.

Otherwise, print n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) after a space — the required permutation.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

You are given a non-empty string s consisting of lowercase English letters. You have to pick exactly one non-empty substring of s and shift all its letters 'z' $\rightarrow$ 'y' $\rightarrow$ 'x' $\rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow$ 'b' $\rightarrow$ 'a' $\rightarrow$ 'z'. In other words, each character is replaced with the previous character of English alphabet and 'a' is replaced with 'z'.

What is the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained from s by performing this shift exactly once?

-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100 000) consisting of lowercase English letters.

-----Output-----

Print the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained from s by shifting letters of exactly one non-empty substring.

Gennady is one of the best child dentists in Berland. Today n children got an appointment with him, they lined up in front of his office.

All children love to cry loudly at the reception at the dentist. We enumerate the children with integers from 1 to n in the order they go in the line. Every child is associated with the value of his cofidence p_{i}. The children take turns one after another to come into the office; each time the child that is the first in the line goes to the doctor.

While Gennady treats the teeth of the i-th child, the child is crying with the volume of v_{i}. At that the confidence of the first child in the line is reduced by the amount of v_{i}, the second one — by value v_{i} - 1, and so on. The children in the queue after the v_{i}-th child almost do not hear the crying, so their confidence remains unchanged.

If at any point in time the confidence of the j-th child is less than zero, he begins to cry with the volume of d_{j} and leaves the line, running towards the exit, without going to the doctor's office. At this the confidence of all the children after the j-th one in the line is reduced by the amount of d_{j}.

All these events occur immediately one after the other in some order. Some cries may lead to other cries, causing a chain reaction. Once in the hallway it is quiet, the child, who is first in the line, goes into the doctor's office.

Help Gennady the Dentist to determine the numbers of kids, whose teeth he will cure. Print their numbers in the chronological order.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 4000) — the number of kids in the line. 

Next n lines contain three integers each v_{i}, d_{i}, p_{i} (1 ≤ v_{i}, d_{i}, p_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the volume of the cry in the doctor's office, the volume of the cry in the hall and the confidence of the i-th child.

-----Output-----

In the first line print number k — the number of children whose teeth Gennady will cure.

In the second line print k integers — the numbers of the children who will make it to the end of the line in the increasing order.

-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

In the first example, Gennady first treats the teeth of the first child who will cry with volume 4. The confidences of the remaining children will get equal to  - 2, 1, 3, 1, respectively. Thus, the second child also cries at the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 0, 2, 0. Then the third child will go to the office, and cry with volume 5. The other children won't bear this, and with a loud cry they will run to the exit.

In the second sample, first the first child goes into the office, he will cry with volume 4. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5,  - 1, 6, 8. Thus, the third child will cry with the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children will be equal to 5, 5, 7. After that, the second child goes to the office and cry with the volume of 5. The confidences of the remaining children will be equal to 0, 3. Then the fourth child will go into the office and cry with the volume of 2. Because of this the confidence of the fifth child will be 1, and he will go into the office last.

Alex decided to go on a touristic trip over the country.

For simplicity let's assume that the country has $n$ cities and $m$ bidirectional roads connecting them. Alex lives in city $s$ and initially located in it. To compare different cities Alex assigned each city a score $w_i$ which is as high as interesting city seems to Alex.

Alex believes that his trip will be interesting only if he will not use any road twice in a row. That is if Alex came to city $v$ from city $u$, he may choose as the next city in the trip any city connected with $v$ by the road, except for the city $u$.

Your task is to help Alex plan his city in a way that maximizes total score over all cities he visited. Note that for each city its score is counted at most once, even if Alex been there several times during his trip.

-----Input-----

First line of input contains two integers $n$ and $m$, ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) which are numbers of cities and roads in the country.

Second line contains $n$ integers $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ ($0 \le w_i \le 10^9$) which are scores of all cities.

The following $m$ lines contain description of the roads. Each of these $m$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$) which are cities connected by this road.

It is guaranteed that there is at most one direct road between any two cities, no city is connected to itself by the road and, finally, it is possible to go from any city to any other one using only roads.

The last line contains single integer $s$ ($1 \le s \le n$), which is the number of the initial city.

-----Output-----

Output single integer which is the maximum possible sum of scores of visited cities.

Allen is hosting a formal dinner party. $2n$ people come to the event in $n$ pairs (couples). After a night of fun, Allen wants to line everyone up for a final picture. The $2n$ people line up, but Allen doesn't like the ordering. Allen prefers if each pair occupies adjacent positions in the line, as this makes the picture more aesthetic.

Help Allen find the minimum number of swaps of adjacent positions he must perform to make it so that each couple occupies adjacent positions in the line.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$), the number of pairs of people.

The second line contains $2n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{2n}$. For each $i$ with $1 \le i \le n$, $i$ appears exactly twice. If $a_j = a_k = i$, that means that the $j$-th and $k$-th people in the line form a couple.

-----Output-----

Output a single integer, representing the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to line the people up so that each pair occupies adjacent positions.

The second sample case already satisfies the constraints; therefore we need $0$ swaps.

Recently, Pari and Arya did some research about NP-Hard problems and they found the minimum vertex cover problem very interesting.

Suppose the graph G is given. Subset A of its vertices is called a vertex cover of this graph, if for each edge uv there is at least one endpoint of it in this set, i.e. $u \in A$ or $v \in A$ (or both).

Pari and Arya have won a great undirected graph as an award in a team contest. Now they have to split it in two parts, but both of them want their parts of the graph to be a vertex cover.

They have agreed to give you their graph and you need to find two disjoint subsets of its vertices A and B, such that both A and B are vertex cover or claim it's impossible. Each vertex should be given to no more than one of the friends (or you can even keep it for yourself).

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the prize graph, respectively.

Each of the next m lines contains a pair of integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1  ≤  u_{i},  v_{i}  ≤  n), denoting an undirected edge between u_{i} and v_{i}. It's guaranteed the graph won't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.

-----Output-----

If it's impossible to split the graph between Pari and Arya as they expect, print ""-1"" (without quotes).

If there are two disjoint sets of vertices, such that both sets are vertex cover, print their descriptions. Each description must contain two lines. The first line contains a single integer k denoting the number of vertices in that vertex cover, and the second line contains k integers — the indices of vertices. Note that because of m ≥ 1, vertex cover cannot be empty.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, you can give the vertex number 2 to Arya and vertices numbered 1 and 3 to Pari and keep vertex number 4 for yourself (or give it someone, if you wish).

In the second sample, there is no way to satisfy both Pari and Arya.

Students went into a class to write a test and sat in some way. The teacher thought: ""Probably they sat in this order to copy works of each other. I need to rearrange them in such a way that students that were neighbors are not neighbors in a new seating.""

The class can be represented as a matrix with n rows and m columns with a student in each cell. Two students are neighbors if cells in which they sit have a common side.

Let's enumerate students from 1 to n·m in order of rows. So a student who initially sits in the cell in row i and column j has a number (i - 1)·m + j. You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to n·m appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix.

-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; n·m ≤ 10^5) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the required matrix.

-----Output-----

If there is no such matrix, output ""NO"" (without quotes). 

Otherwise in the first line output ""YES"" (without quotes), and in the next n lines output m integers which form the required matrix.

-----Examples-----
Input
2 4

Output
YES
5 4 7 2 
3 6 1 8 

Input
2 1

Output
NO

-----Note-----

In the first test case the matrix initially looks like this:

1 2 3 4

5 6 7 8

It's easy to see that there are no two students that are adjacent in both matrices.

In the second test case there are only two possible seatings and in both of them students with numbers 1 and 2 are neighbors.

Squirrel Liss lived in a forest peacefully, but unexpected trouble happens. Stones fall from a mountain. Initially Squirrel Liss occupies an interval [0, 1]. Next, n stones will fall and Liss will escape from the stones. The stones are numbered from 1 to n in order.

The stones always fall to the center of Liss's interval. When Liss occupies the interval [k - d, k + d] and a stone falls to k, she will escape to the left or to the right. If she escapes to the left, her new interval will be [k - d, k]. If she escapes to the right, her new interval will be [k, k + d].

You are given a string s of length n. If the i-th character of s is ""l"" or ""r"", when the i-th stone falls Liss will escape to the left or to the right, respectively. Find the sequence of stones' numbers from left to right after all the n stones falls.

-----Input-----

The input consists of only one line. The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). Each character in s will be either ""l"" or ""r"".

-----Output-----

Output n lines — on the i-th line you should print the i-th stone's number from the left.

Dreamoon likes coloring cells very much.

There is a row of $n$ cells. Initially, all cells are empty (don't contain any color). Cells are numbered from $1$ to $n$.

You are given an integer $m$ and $m$ integers $l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_m$ ($1 \le l_i \le n$)

Dreamoon will perform $m$ operations.

In $i$-th operation, Dreamoon will choose a number $p_i$ from range $[1, n-l_i+1]$ (inclusive) and will paint all cells from $p_i$ to $p_i+l_i-1$ (inclusive) in $i$-th color. Note that cells may be colored more one than once, in this case, cell will have the color from the latest operation.

Dreamoon hopes that after these $m$ operations, all colors will appear at least once and all cells will be colored. Please help Dreamoon to choose $p_i$ in each operation to satisfy all constraints.

-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n,m$ ($1 \leq m \leq n \leq 100\,000$).

The second line contains $m$ integers $l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_m$ ($1 \leq l_i \leq n$).

-----Output-----

If it's impossible to perform $m$ operations to satisfy all constraints, print ""'-1"" (without quotes).

Otherwise, print $m$ integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ ($1 \leq p_i \leq n - l_i + 1$), after these $m$ operations, all colors should appear at least once and all cells should be colored.

If there are several possible solutions, you can print any.

You work in a big office. It is a 9 floor building with an elevator that can accommodate up to 4 people. It is your responsibility to manage this elevator.

Today you are late, so there are queues on some floors already. For each person you know the floor where he currently is and the floor he wants to reach. Also, you know the order in which people came to the elevator.

According to the company's rules, if an employee comes to the elevator earlier than another one, he has to enter the elevator earlier too (even if these employees stay on different floors). Note that the employees are allowed to leave the elevator in arbitrary order.

The elevator has two commands:   Go up or down one floor. The movement takes 1 second.  Open the doors on the current floor. During this operation all the employees who have reached their destination get out of the elevator. Then all the employees on the floor get in the elevator in the order they are queued up while it doesn't contradict the company's rules and there is enough space in the elevator. Each employee spends 1 second to get inside and outside the elevator. 

Initially the elevator is empty and is located on the floor 1.

You are interested what is the minimum possible time you need to spend to deliver all the employees to their destination. It is not necessary to return the elevator to the floor 1.

-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of employees.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 9, a_{i} ≠ b_{i}) — the floor on which an employee initially is, and the floor he wants to reach.

The employees are given in the order they came to the elevator.

-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimal possible time in seconds.

Igor the analyst has adopted n little bunnies. As we all know, bunnies love carrots. Thus, Igor has bought a carrot to be shared between his bunnies. Igor wants to treat all the bunnies equally, and thus he wants to cut the carrot into n pieces of equal area. 

Formally, the carrot can be viewed as an isosceles triangle with base length equal to 1 and height equal to h. Igor wants to make n - 1 cuts parallel to the base to cut the carrot into n pieces. He wants to make sure that all n pieces have the same area. Can you help Igor determine where to cut the carrot so that each piece have equal area?

 [Image] Illustration to the first example. 

-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers, n and h (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^5).

-----Output-----

The output should contain n - 1 real numbers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} - 1. The number x_{i} denotes that the i-th cut must be made x_{i} units away from the apex of the carrot. In addition, 0 < x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{n} - 1 < h must hold. 

Your output will be considered correct if absolute or relative error of every number in your output doesn't exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.

Arkady needs your help again! This time he decided to build his own high-speed Internet exchange point. It should consist of n nodes connected with minimum possible number of wires into one network (a wire directly connects two nodes). Exactly k of the nodes should be exit-nodes, that means that each of them should be connected to exactly one other node of the network, while all other nodes should be connected to at least two nodes in order to increase the system stability.

Arkady wants to make the system as fast as possible, so he wants to minimize the maximum distance between two exit-nodes. The distance between two nodes is the number of wires a package needs to go through between those two nodes.

Help Arkady to find such a way to build the network that the distance between the two most distant exit-nodes is as small as possible.

-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the total number of nodes and the number of exit-nodes.

Note that it is always possible to build at least one network with n nodes and k exit-nodes within the given constraints.

-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes. In each of the next n - 1 lines print two integers: the ids of the nodes connected by a wire. The description of each wire should be printed exactly once. You can print wires and wires' ends in arbitrary order. The nodes should be numbered from 1 to n. Exit-nodes can have any ids.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

We all know the impressive story of Robin Hood. Robin Hood uses his archery skills and his wits to steal the money from rich, and return it to the poor.

There are n citizens in Kekoland, each person has c_{i} coins. Each day, Robin Hood will take exactly 1 coin from the richest person in the city and he will give it to the poorest person (poorest person right after taking richest's 1 coin). In case the choice is not unique, he will select one among them at random. Sadly, Robin Hood is old and want to retire in k days. He decided to spend these last days with helping poor people. 

After taking his money are taken by Robin Hood richest person may become poorest person as well, and it might even happen that Robin Hood will give his money back. For example if all people have same number of coins, then next day they will have same number of coins too. 

Your task is to find the difference between richest and poorest persons wealth after k days. Note that the choosing at random among richest and poorest doesn't affect the answer.

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 500 000, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the number of citizens in Kekoland and the number of days left till Robin Hood's retirement.

The second line contains n integers, the i-th of them is c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — initial wealth of the i-th person.

-----Output-----

Print a single line containing the difference between richest and poorest peoples wealth.

-----Examples-----
Input
4 1
1 1 4 2

Output
2

Input
3 1
2 2 2

Output
0

-----Note-----

Lets look at how wealth changes through day in the first sample.  [1, 1, 4, 2]  [2, 1, 3, 2] or [1, 2, 3, 2] 

So the answer is 3 - 1 = 2

In second sample wealth will remain the same for each person.

Gerald plays the following game. He has a checkered field of size n × n cells, where m various cells are banned. Before the game, he has to put a few chips on some border (but not corner) board cells. Then for n - 1 minutes, Gerald every minute moves each chip into an adjacent cell. He moves each chip from its original edge to the opposite edge. Gerald loses in this game in each of the three cases:  At least one of the chips at least once fell to the banned cell.  At least once two chips were on the same cell.  At least once two chips swapped in a minute (for example, if you stand two chips on two opposite border cells of a row with even length, this situation happens in the middle of the row). 

In that case he loses and earns 0 points. When nothing like that happened, he wins and earns the number of points equal to the number of chips he managed to put on the board. Help Gerald earn the most points.

-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the size of the field and the number of banned cells. Next m lines each contain two space-separated integers. Specifically, the i-th of these lines contains numbers x_{i} and y_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ n) — the coordinates of the i-th banned cell. All given cells are distinct.

Consider the field rows numbered from top to bottom from 1 to n, and the columns — from left to right from 1 to n.

-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum points Gerald can earn in this game.

-----Note-----

In the first test the answer equals zero as we can't put chips into the corner cells.

In the second sample we can place one chip into either cell (1, 2), or cell (3, 2), or cell (2, 1), or cell (2, 3). We cannot place two chips.

In the third sample we can only place one chip into either cell (2, 1), or cell (2, 4).

$n$ boys and $m$ girls came to the party. Each boy presented each girl some integer number of sweets (possibly zero). All boys are numbered with integers from $1$ to $n$ and all girls are numbered with integers from $1$ to $m$. For all $1 \leq i \leq n$ the minimal number of sweets, which $i$-th boy presented to some girl is equal to $b_i$ and for all $1 \leq j \leq m$ the maximal number of sweets, which $j$-th girl received from some boy is equal to $g_j$.

More formally, let $a_{i,j}$ be the number of sweets which the $i$-th boy give to the $j$-th girl. Then $b_i$ is equal exactly to the minimum among values $a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \ldots, a_{i,m}$ and $g_j$ is equal exactly to the maximum among values $b_{1,j}, b_{2,j}, \ldots, b_{n,j}$.

You are interested in the minimum total number of sweets that boys could present, so you need to minimize the sum of $a_{i,j}$ for all $(i,j)$ such that $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $1 \leq j \leq m$. You are given the numbers $b_1, \ldots, b_n$ and $g_1, \ldots, g_m$, determine this number. 

-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$, separated with space — the number of boys and girls, respectively ($2 \leq n, m \leq 100\,000$). The second line contains $n$ integers $b_1, \ldots, b_n$, separated by spaces — $b_i$ is equal to the minimal number of sweets, which $i$-th boy presented to some girl ($0 \leq b_i \leq 10^8$). The third line contains $m$ integers $g_1, \ldots, g_m$, separated by spaces — $g_j$ is equal to the maximal number of sweets, which $j$-th girl received from some boy ($0 \leq g_j \leq 10^8$).

-----Output-----

If the described situation is impossible, print $-1$. In another case, print the minimal total number of sweets, which boys could have presented and all conditions could have satisfied.

-----Note-----

In the first test, the minimal total number of sweets, which boys could have presented is equal to $12$. This can be possible, for example, if the first boy presented $1$ and $4$ sweets, the second boy presented $3$ and $2$ sweets and the third boy presented $1$ and $1$ sweets for the first and the second girl, respectively. It's easy to see, that all conditions are satisfied and the total number of sweets is equal to $12$.

In the second test, the boys couldn't have presented sweets in such way, that all statements satisfied.

In the third test, the minimal total number of sweets, which boys could have presented is equal to $4$. This can be possible, for example, if the first boy presented $1$, $1$, $2$ sweets for the first, second, third girl, respectively and the second boy didn't present sweets for each girl. It's easy to see, that all conditions are satisfied and the total number of sweets is equal to $4$.

3R2 as DJ Mashiro - Happiness Breeze Ice - DJ Mashiro is dead or alive

NEKO#ΦωΦ has just got a new maze game on her PC!

The game's main puzzle is a maze, in the forms of a $2 \times n$ rectangle grid. NEKO's task is to lead a Nekomimi girl from cell $(1, 1)$ to the gate at $(2, n)$ and escape the maze. The girl can only move between cells sharing a common side.

However, at some moments during the game, some cells may change their state: either from normal ground to lava (which forbids movement into that cell), or vice versa (which makes that cell passable again). Initially all cells are of the ground type.

After hours of streaming, NEKO finally figured out there are only $q$ such moments: the $i$-th moment toggles the state of cell $(r_i, c_i)$ (either from ground to lava or vice versa).

Knowing this, NEKO wonders, after each of the $q$ moments, whether it is still possible to move from cell $(1, 1)$ to cell $(2, n)$ without going through any lava cells.

Although NEKO is a great streamer and gamer, she still can't get through quizzes and problems requiring large amount of Brain Power. Can you help her?

-----Input-----

The first line contains integers $n$, $q$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$, $1 \le q \le 10^5$).

The $i$-th of $q$ following lines contains two integers $r_i$, $c_i$ ($1 \le r_i \le 2$, $1 \le c_i \le n$), denoting the coordinates of the cell to be flipped at the $i$-th moment.

It is guaranteed that cells $(1, 1)$ and $(2, n)$ never appear in the query list.

-----Output-----

For each moment, if it is possible to travel from cell $(1, 1)$ to cell $(2, n)$, print ""Yes"", otherwise print ""No"". There should be exactly $q$ answers, one after every update.

You can print the words in any case (either lowercase, uppercase or mixed).

-----Example-----
Input
5 5
2 3
1 4
2 4
2 3
1 4

Output
Yes
No
No
No
Yes

-----Note-----

We'll crack down the example test here:  After the first query, the girl still able to reach the goal. One of the shortest path ways should be: $(1,1) \to (1,2) \to (1,3) \to (1,4) \to (1,5) \to (2,5)$.  After the second query, it's impossible to move to the goal, since the farthest cell she could reach is $(1, 3)$.  After the fourth query, the $(2, 3)$ is not blocked, but now all the $4$-th column is blocked, so she still can't reach the goal.  After the fifth query, the column barrier has been lifted, thus she can go to the final goal again.

Edo has got a collection of n refrigerator magnets!

He decided to buy a refrigerator and hang the magnets on the door. The shop can make the refrigerator with any size of the door that meets the following restrictions: the refrigerator door must be rectangle, and both the length and the width of the door must be positive integers.

Edo figured out how he wants to place the magnets on the refrigerator. He introduced a system of coordinates on the plane, where each magnet is represented as a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Now he wants to remove no more than k magnets (he may choose to keep all of them) and attach all remaining magnets to the refrigerator door, and the area of ​​the door should be as small as possible. A magnet is considered to be attached to the refrigerator door if its center lies on the door or on its boundary. The relative positions of all the remaining magnets must correspond to the plan.

Let us explain the last two sentences. Let's suppose we want to hang two magnets on the refrigerator. If the magnet in the plan has coordinates of the lower left corner (x_1, y_1) and the upper right corner (x_2, y_2), then its center is located at ($\frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}$, $\frac{y_{1} + y_{2}}{2}$) (may not be integers). By saying the relative position should correspond to the plan we mean that the only available operation is translation, i.e. the vector connecting the centers of two magnets in the original plan, must be equal to the vector connecting the centers of these two magnets on the refrigerator.

The sides of the refrigerator door must also be parallel to coordinate axes.

-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ k ≤ min(10, n - 1)) — the number of magnets that Edo has and the maximum number of magnets Edo may not place on the refrigerator.

Next n lines describe the initial plan of placing magnets. Each line contains four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^9) — the coordinates of the lower left and upper right corners of the current magnet. The magnets can partially overlap or even fully coincide.

-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum area of the door of refrigerator, which can be used to place at least n - k magnets, preserving the relative positions.

-----Note-----

In the first test sample it is optimal to remove either the first or the third magnet. If we remove the first magnet, the centers of two others will lie at points (2.5, 2.5) and (3.5, 3.5). Thus, it is enough to buy a fridge with door width 1 and door height 1, the area of the door also equals one, correspondingly.

In the second test sample it doesn't matter which magnet to remove, the answer will not change — we need a fridge with door width 8 and door height 8.

In the third sample you cannot remove anything as k = 0.

Ivan has an array consisting of n different integers. He decided to reorder all elements in increasing order. Ivan loves merge sort so he decided to represent his array with one or several increasing sequences which he then plans to merge into one sorted array.

Ivan represent his array with increasing sequences with help of the following algorithm.

While there is at least one unused number in array Ivan repeats the following procedure:  iterate through array from the left to the right;  Ivan only looks at unused numbers on current iteration;  if current number is the first unused number on this iteration or this number is greater than previous unused number on current iteration, then Ivan marks the number as used and writes it down. 

For example, if Ivan's array looks like [1, 3, 2, 5, 4] then he will perform two iterations. On first iteration Ivan will use and write numbers [1, 3, 5], and on second one — [2, 4].

Write a program which helps Ivan and finds representation of the given array with one or several increasing sequences in accordance with algorithm described above.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of elements in Ivan's array.

The second line contains a sequence consisting of distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — Ivan's array.

-----Output-----

Print representation of the given array in the form of one or more increasing sequences in accordance with the algorithm described above. Each sequence must be printed on a new line.

You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} consisting of different integers. It is required to split this sequence into the maximum number of subsequences such that after sorting integers in each of them in increasing order, the total sequence also will be sorted in increasing order.

Sorting integers in a subsequence is a process such that the numbers included in a subsequence are ordered in increasing order, and the numbers which are not included in a subsequence don't change their places.

Every element of the sequence must appear in exactly one subsequence.

-----Input-----

The first line of input data contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the sequence.

The second line of input data contains n different integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the sequence. It is guaranteed that all elements of the sequence are distinct.

-----Output-----

In the first line print the maximum number of subsequences k, which the original sequence can be split into while fulfilling the requirements.

In the next k lines print the description of subsequences in the following format: the number of elements in subsequence c_{i} (0 < c_{i} ≤ n), then c_{i} integers l_1, l_2, ..., l_{c}_{i} (1 ≤ l_{j} ≤ n) — indices of these elements in the original sequence. 

Indices could be printed in any order. Every index from 1 to n must appear in output exactly once.

If there are several possible answers, print any of them.

Jeff has become friends with Furik. Now these two are going to play one quite amusing game.

At the beginning of the game Jeff takes a piece of paper and writes down a permutation consisting of n numbers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. Then the guys take turns to make moves, Jeff moves first. During his move, Jeff chooses two adjacent permutation elements and then the boy swaps them. During his move, Furic tosses a coin and if the coin shows ""heads"" he chooses a random pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which an inequality p_{i} > p_{i} + 1 holds, and swaps them. But if the coin shows ""tails"", Furik chooses a random pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which the inequality p_{i} < p_{i} + 1 holds, and swaps them. If the coin shows ""heads"" or ""tails"" and Furik has multiple ways of adjacent pairs to take, then he uniformly takes one of the pairs. If Furik doesn't have any pair to take, he tosses a coin one more time. The game ends when the permutation is sorted in the increasing order.

Jeff wants the game to finish as quickly as possible (that is, he wants both players to make as few moves as possible). Help Jeff find the minimum mathematical expectation of the number of moves in the game if he moves optimally well.

You can consider that the coin shows the heads (or tails) with the probability of 50 percent.

-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000). The next line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation p. The numbers are separated by spaces.

-----Output-----

In a single line print a single real value — the answer to the problem. The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^{ - 6}.

DZY loves Physics, and he enjoys calculating density.

Almost everything has density, even a graph. We define the density of a non-directed graph (nodes and edges of the graph have some values) as follows: $\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{\frac{v}{e}} & {(e > 0)} \\{0} & {(e = 0)} \end{array} \right.$ where v is the sum of the values of the nodes, e is the sum of the values of the edges.

Once DZY got a graph G, now he wants to find a connected induced subgraph G' of the graph, such that the density of G' is as large as possible.

An induced subgraph G'(V', E') of a graph G(V, E) is a graph that satisfies:  $V^{\prime} \subseteq V$;  edge $(a, b) \in E^{\prime}$ if and only if $a \in V^{\prime}, b \in V^{\prime}$, and edge $(a, b) \in E$;  the value of an edge in G' is the same as the value of the corresponding edge in G, so as the value of a node. 

Help DZY to find the induced subgraph with maximum density. Note that the induced subgraph you choose must be connected. [Image] 

-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), $m(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n(n - 1)}{2})$. Integer n represents the number of nodes of the graph G, m represents the number of edges.

The second line contains n space-separated integers x_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^6), where x_{i} represents the value of the i-th node. Consider the graph nodes are numbered from 1 to n.

Each of the next m lines contains three space-separated integers a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} < b_{i} ≤ n; 1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^3), denoting an edge between node a_{i} and b_{i} with value c_{i}. The graph won't contain multiple edges.

-----Output-----

Output a real number denoting the answer, with an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{ - 9}.

In the spirit of the holidays, Saitama has given Genos two grid paths of length n (a weird gift even by Saitama's standards). A grid path is an ordered sequence of neighbouring squares in an infinite grid. Two squares are neighbouring if they share a side.

One example of a grid path is (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (1, 2) → (1, 1) → (0, 1) → ( - 1, 1). Note that squares in this sequence might be repeated, i.e. path has self intersections.

Movement within a grid path is restricted to adjacent squares within the sequence. That is, from the i-th square, one can only move to the (i - 1)-th or (i + 1)-th squares of this path. Note that there is only a single valid move from the first and last squares of a grid path. Also note, that even if there is some j-th square of the path that coincides with the i-th square, only moves to (i - 1)-th and (i + 1)-th squares are available. For example, from the second square in the above sequence, one can only move to either the first or third squares.

To ensure that movement is not ambiguous, the two grid paths will not have an alternating sequence of three squares. For example, a contiguous subsequence (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 0) cannot occur in a valid grid path.

One marble is placed on the first square of each grid path. Genos wants to get both marbles to the last square of each grid path. However, there is a catch. Whenever he moves one marble, the other marble will copy its movement if possible. For instance, if one marble moves east, then the other marble will try and move east as well. By try, we mean if moving east is a valid move, then the marble will move east.

Moving north increases the second coordinate by 1, while moving south decreases it by 1. Similarly, moving east increases first coordinate by 1, while moving west decreases it.

Given these two valid grid paths, Genos wants to know if it is possible to move both marbles to the ends of their respective paths. That is, if it is possible to move the marbles such that both marbles rest on the last square of their respective paths.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000) — the length of the paths.

The second line of the input contains a string consisting of n - 1 characters (each of which is either 'N', 'E', 'S', or 'W') — the first grid path. The characters can be thought of as the sequence of moves needed to traverse the grid path. For example, the example path in the problem statement can be expressed by the string ""NNESWW"".

The third line of the input contains a string of n - 1 characters (each of which is either 'N', 'E', 'S', or 'W') — the second grid path.

-----Output-----

Print ""YES"" (without quotes) if it is possible for both marbles to be at the end position at the same time. Print ""NO"" (without quotes) otherwise. In both cases, the answer is case-insensitive.

-----Examples-----
Input
7
NNESWW
SWSWSW

Output
YES

Input
3

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample, the first grid path is the one described in the statement. Moreover, the following sequence of moves will get both marbles to the end: NNESWWSWSW.

In the second sample, no sequence of moves can get both marbles to the end.

Evlampiy was gifted a rooted tree. The vertices of the tree are numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each of its vertices also has an integer $a_i$ written on it. For each vertex $i$, Evlampiy calculated $c_i$ — the number of vertices $j$ in the subtree of vertex $i$, such that $a_j < a_i$. [Image]Illustration for the second example, the first integer is $a_i$ and the integer in parentheses is $c_i$

After the new year, Evlampiy could not remember what his gift was! He remembers the tree and the values of $c_i$, but he completely forgot which integers $a_i$ were written on the vertices.

Help him to restore initial integers!

-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $n$ $(1 \leq n \leq 2000)$ — the number of vertices in the tree.

The next $n$ lines contain descriptions of vertices: the $i$-th line contains two integers $p_i$ and $c_i$ ($0 \leq p_i \leq n$; $0 \leq c_i \leq n-1$), where $p_i$ is the parent of vertex $i$ or $0$ if vertex $i$ is root, and $c_i$ is the number of vertices $j$ in the subtree of vertex $i$, such that $a_j < a_i$.

It is guaranteed that the values of $p_i$ describe a rooted tree with $n$ vertices.

-----Output-----

If a solution exists, in the first line print ""YES"", and in the second line output $n$ integers $a_i$ $(1 \leq a_i \leq {10}^{9})$. If there are several solutions, output any of them. One can prove that if there is a solution, then there is also a solution in which all $a_i$ are between $1$ and $10^9$.

If there are no solutions, print ""NO"".

Arkady plays Gardenscapes a lot. Arkady wants to build two new fountains. There are n available fountains, for each fountain its beauty and cost are known. There are two types of money in the game: coins and diamonds, so each fountain cost can be either in coins or diamonds. No money changes between the types are allowed.

Help Arkady to find two fountains with maximum total beauty so that he can buy both at the same time.

-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, c and d (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ c, d ≤ 100 000) — the number of fountains, the number of coins and diamonds Arkady has.

The next n lines describe fountains. Each of these lines contain two integers b_{i} and p_{i} (1 ≤ b_{i}, p_{i} ≤ 100 000) — the beauty and the cost of the i-th fountain, and then a letter ""C"" or ""D"", describing in which type of money is the cost of fountain i: in coins or in diamonds, respectively.

-----Output-----

Print the maximum total beauty of exactly two fountains Arkady can build. If he can't build two fountains, print 0.

-----Note-----

In the first example Arkady should build the second fountain with beauty 4, which costs 3 coins. The first fountain he can't build because he don't have enough coins. Also Arkady should build the third fountain with beauty 5 which costs 6 diamonds. Thus the total beauty of built fountains is 9.

In the second example there are two fountains, but Arkady can't build both of them, because he needs 5 coins for the first fountain, and Arkady has only 4 coins.

Ziota found a video game called ""Monster Invaders"".

Similar to every other shooting RPG game, ""Monster Invaders"" involves killing monsters and bosses with guns.

For the sake of simplicity, we only consider two different types of monsters and three different types of guns.

Namely, the two types of monsters are:   a normal monster with $1$ hp.  a boss with $2$ hp. 

And the three types of guns are:   Pistol, deals $1$ hp in damage to one monster, $r_1$ reloading time  Laser gun, deals $1$ hp in damage to all the monsters in the current level (including the boss), $r_2$ reloading time  AWP, instantly kills any monster, $r_3$ reloading time 

The guns are initially not loaded, and the Ziota can only reload 1 gun at a time.

The levels of the game can be considered as an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, in which the $i$-th stage has $a_i$ normal monsters and 1 boss. Due to the nature of the game, Ziota cannot use the Pistol (the first type of gun) or AWP (the third type of gun) to shoot the boss before killing all of the $a_i$ normal monsters.

If Ziota damages the boss but does not kill it immediately, he is forced to move out of the current level to an arbitrary adjacent level (adjacent levels of level $i$ $(1 < i < n)$ are levels $i - 1$ and $i + 1$, the only adjacent level of level $1$ is level $2$, the only adjacent level of level $n$ is level $n - 1$). Ziota can also choose to move to an adjacent level at any time. Each move between adjacent levels are managed by portals with $d$ teleportation time.

In order not to disrupt the space-time continuum within the game, it is strictly forbidden to reload or shoot monsters during teleportation. 

Ziota starts the game at level 1. The objective of the game is rather simple, to kill all the bosses in all the levels. He is curious about the minimum time to finish the game (assuming it takes no time to shoot the monsters with a loaded gun and Ziota has infinite ammo on all the three guns). Please help him find this value.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains five integers separated by single spaces: $n$ $(2 \le n \le 10^6)$ — the number of stages, $r_1, r_2, r_3$ $(1 \le r_1 \le r_2 \le r_3 \le 10^9)$ — the reload time of the three guns respectively, $d$ $(1 \le d \le 10^9)$ — the time of moving between adjacent levels.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers separated by single spaces $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $(1 \le a_i \le 10^6, 1 \le i \le n)$.

-----Output-----

Print one integer, the minimum time to finish the game.

4 1 3 4 3

Output

Input
4 2 4 4 1
4 5 1 2

Output

-----Note-----

In the first test case, the optimal strategy is:  Use the pistol to kill three normal monsters and AWP to kill the boss (Total time $1\cdot3+4=7$)  Move to stage two (Total time $7+3=10$)  Use the pistol twice and AWP to kill the boss (Total time $10+1\cdot2+4=16$)  Move to stage three (Total time $16+3=19$)  Use the laser gun and forced to move to either stage four or two, here we move to stage four (Total time $19+3+3=25$)  Use the pistol once, use AWP to kill the boss (Total time $25+1\cdot1+4=30$)  Move back to stage three (Total time $30+3=33$)  Kill the boss at stage three with the pistol (Total time $33+1=34$) 

Note that here, we do not finish at level $n$, but when all the bosses are killed.

This is the easier version of the problem. In this version, $1 \le n \le 10^5$ and $0 \le a_i \le 1$. You can hack this problem only if you solve and lock both problems.

Christmas is coming, and our protagonist, Bob, is preparing a spectacular present for his long-time best friend Alice. This year, he decides to prepare $n$ boxes of chocolate, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Initially, the $i$-th box contains $a_i$ chocolate pieces.

Since Bob is a typical nice guy, he will not send Alice $n$ empty boxes. In other words, at least one of $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ is positive. Since Alice dislikes coprime sets, she will be happy only if there exists some integer $k > 1$ such that the number of pieces in each box is divisible by $k$. Note that Alice won't mind if there exists some empty boxes. 

Charlie, Alice's boyfriend, also is Bob's second best friend, so he decides to help Bob by rearranging the chocolate pieces. In one second, Charlie can pick up a piece in box $i$ and put it into either box $i-1$ or box $i+1$ (if such boxes exist). Of course, he wants to help his friend as quickly as possible. Therefore, he asks you to calculate the minimum number of seconds he would need to make Alice happy.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of chocolate boxes.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1$) — the number of chocolate pieces in the $i$-th box.

It is guaranteed that at least one of $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ is positive.

-----Output-----

If there is no way for Charlie to make Alice happy, print $-1$.

Otherwise, print a single integer $x$ — the minimum number of seconds for Charlie to help Bob make Alice happy.

One of Timofey's birthday presents is a colourbook in a shape of an infinite plane. On the plane n rectangles with sides parallel to coordinate axes are situated. All sides of the rectangles have odd length. Rectangles cannot intersect, but they can touch each other.

Help Timofey to color his rectangles in 4 different colors in such a way that every two rectangles touching each other by side would have different color, or determine that it is impossible.

Two rectangles intersect if their intersection has positive area. Two rectangles touch by sides if there is a pair of sides such that their intersection has non-zero length [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example 

-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5) — the number of rectangles.

n lines follow. The i-th of these lines contains four integers x_1, y_1, x_2 and y_2 ( - 10^9 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^9,  - 10^9 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^9), that means that points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) are the coordinates of two opposite corners of the i-th rectangle.

It is guaranteed, that all sides of the rectangles have odd lengths and rectangles don't intersect each other.

-----Output-----

Print ""NO"" in the only line if it is impossible to color the rectangles in 4 different colors in such a way that every two rectangles touching each other by side would have different color.

Otherwise, print ""YES"" in the first line. Then print n lines, in the i-th of them print single integer c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 4) — the color of i-th rectangle.

Polycarp is making a quest for his friends. He has already made n tasks, for each task the boy evaluated how interesting it is as an integer q_{i}, and the time t_{i} in minutes needed to complete the task. 

An interesting feature of his quest is: each participant should get the task that is best suited for him, depending on his preferences. The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with ""yes"" or ""no"". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks. 

We know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than T minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the n tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most T minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task. Each task can only be used once (i.e., the people who give different answers to questions should get different tasks).

Polycarp wants the total ""interest"" value of the tasks involved in the quest to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum possible total interest value of the task considering that the quest should be completed in T minutes at any variant of answering questions.

-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and T (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of tasks made by Polycarp and the maximum time a quest player should fit into.

Next n lines contain two integers t_{i}, q_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ T, 1 ≤ q_{i} ≤ 1000) each — the time in minutes needed to complete the i-th task and its interest value.

-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum possible total interest value of all the tasks in the quest.

-----Note-----

In the first sample test all the five tasks can be complemented with four questions and joined into one quest.

In the second sample test it is impossible to use all the five tasks, but you can take two of them, the most interesting ones.

In the third sample test the optimal strategy is to include only the second task into the quest.

Here is the picture that illustrates the answers to the sample tests. The blue circles represent the questions, the two arrows that go from every circle represent where a person goes depending on his answer to that question. The tasks are the red ovals. [Image]

Just to remind, girls in Arpa's land are really nice.

Mehrdad wants to invite some Hoses to the palace for a dancing party. Each Hos has some weight w_{i} and some beauty b_{i}. Also each Hos may have some friends. Hoses are divided in some friendship groups. Two Hoses x and y are in the same friendship group if and only if there is a sequence of Hoses a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} such that a_{i} and a_{i} + 1 are friends for each 1 ≤ i < k, and a_1 = x and a_{k} = y.

 [Image] 

Arpa allowed to use the amphitheater of palace to Mehrdad for this party. Arpa's amphitheater can hold at most w weight on it. 

Mehrdad is so greedy that he wants to invite some Hoses such that sum of their weights is not greater than w and sum of their beauties is as large as possible. Along with that, from each friendship group he can either invite all Hoses, or no more than one. Otherwise, some Hoses will be hurt. Find for Mehrdad the maximum possible total beauty of Hoses he can invite so that no one gets hurt and the total weight doesn't exceed w.

-----Input-----

The first line contains integers n, m and w (1  ≤  n  ≤  1000, $0 \leq m \leq \operatorname{min}(\frac{n \cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 10^{5})$, 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000) — the number of Hoses, the number of pair of friends and the maximum total weight of those who are invited.

The second line contains n integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_{n} (1 ≤ w_{i} ≤ 1000) — the weights of the Hoses.

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the beauties of the Hoses.

The next m lines contain pairs of friends, the i-th of them contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ n, x_{i} ≠ y_{i}), meaning that Hoses x_{i} and y_{i} are friends. Note that friendship is bidirectional. All pairs (x_{i}, y_{i}) are distinct.

-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible total beauty of Hoses Mehrdad can invite so that no one gets hurt and the total weight doesn't exceed w.

-----Note-----

In the first sample there are two friendship groups: Hoses {1, 2} and Hos {3}. The best way is to choose all of Hoses in the first group, sum of their weights is equal to 5 and sum of their beauty is 6.

In the second sample there are two friendship groups: Hoses {1, 2, 3} and Hos {4}. Mehrdad can't invite all the Hoses from the first group because their total weight is 12 > 11, thus the best way is to choose the first Hos from the first group and the only one from the second group. The total weight will be 8, and the total beauty will be 7.

Consider a tree $T$ (that is, a connected graph without cycles) with $n$ vertices labelled $1$ through $n$. We start the following process with $T$: while $T$ has more than one vertex, do the following:

 choose a random edge of $T$ equiprobably;

 shrink the chosen edge: if the edge was connecting vertices $v$ and $u$, erase both $v$ and $u$ and create a new vertex adjacent to all vertices previously adjacent to either $v$ or $u$. The new vertex is labelled either $v$ or $u$ equiprobably.

At the end of the process, $T$ consists of a single vertex labelled with one of the numbers $1, \ldots, n$. For each of the numbers, what is the probability of this number becoming the label of the final vertex?

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The following $n - 1$ lines describe the tree edges. Each of these lines contains two integers $u_i, v_i$ — labels of vertices connected by the respective edge ($1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n$, $u_i \neq v_i$). It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.

-----Output-----

Print $n$ floating numbers — the desired probabilities for labels $1, \ldots, n$ respectively. All numbers should be correct up to $10^{-6}$ relative or absolute precision.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, the resulting vertex has label 1 if and only if for all three edges the label 1 survives, hence the probability is $1/2^3 = 1/8$. All other labels have equal probability due to symmetry, hence each of them has probability $(1 - 1/8) / 3 = 7/24$.

Everybody seems to think that the Martians are green, but it turns out they are metallic pink and fat. Ajs has two bags of distinct nonnegative integers. The bags are disjoint, and the union of the sets of numbers in the bags is $\{0,1,…,M-1\}$, for some positive integer $M$. Ajs draws a number from the first bag and a number from the second bag, and then sums them modulo $M$.

What are the residues modulo $M$ that Ajs cannot obtain with this action?

-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 200\,000$) and $M$ ($N+1 \leq M \leq 10^{9}$), denoting the number of the elements in the first bag and the modulus, respectively.

The second line contains $N$ nonnegative integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_N$ ($0 \leq a_1<a_2< \ldots< a_N<M$), the contents of the first bag.

-----Output-----

In the first line, output the cardinality $K$ of the set of residues modulo $M$ which Ajs cannot obtain.

In the second line of the output, print $K$ space-separated integers greater or equal than zero and less than $M$, which represent the residues Ajs cannot obtain. The outputs should be sorted in increasing order of magnitude. If $K$=0, do not output the second line.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, the first bag and the second bag contain $\{3,4\}$ and $\{0,1,2\}$, respectively. Ajs can obtain every residue modulo $5$ except the residue $2$: $ 4+1 \equiv 0, \, 4+2 \equiv 1, \, 3+0 \equiv 3, \, 3+1 \equiv 4 $ modulo $5$. One can check that there is no choice of elements from the first and the second bag which sum to $2$ modulo $5$.

In the second sample, the contents of the first bag are $\{5,25,125,625\}$, while the second bag contains all other nonnegative integers with at most $9$ decimal digits. Every residue modulo $1\,000\,000\,000$ can be obtained as a sum of an element in the first bag and an element in the second bag.

Jzzhu has picked n apples from his big apple tree. All the apples are numbered from 1 to n. Now he wants to sell them to an apple store. 

Jzzhu will pack his apples into groups and then sell them. Each group must contain two apples, and the greatest common divisor of numbers of the apples in each group must be greater than 1. Of course, each apple can be part of at most one group.

Jzzhu wonders how to get the maximum possible number of groups. Can you help him?

-----Input-----

A single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of the apples.

-----Output-----

The first line must contain a single integer m, representing the maximum number of groups he can get. Each of the next m lines must contain two integers — the numbers of apples in the current group.

If there are several optimal answers you can print any of them.

Today Sonya learned about long integers and invited all her friends to share the fun. Sonya has an initially empty multiset with integers. Friends give her t queries, each of one of the following type:   +  a_{i} — add non-negative integer a_{i} to the multiset. Note, that she has a multiset, thus there may be many occurrences of the same integer.   -  a_{i} — delete a single occurrence of non-negative integer a_{i} from the multiset. It's guaranteed, that there is at least one a_{i} in the multiset.  ? s — count the number of integers in the multiset (with repetitions) that match some pattern s consisting of 0 and 1. In the pattern, 0 stands for the even digits, while 1 stands for the odd. Integer x matches the pattern s, if the parity of the i-th from the right digit in decimal notation matches the i-th from the right digit of the pattern. If the pattern is shorter than this integer, it's supplemented with 0-s from the left. Similarly, if the integer is shorter than the pattern its decimal notation is supplemented with the 0-s from the left. 

For example, if the pattern is s = 010, than integers 92, 2212, 50 and 414 match the pattern, while integers 3, 110, 25 and 1030 do not.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100 000) — the number of operation Sonya has to perform.

Next t lines provide the descriptions of the queries in order they appear in the input file. The i-th row starts with a character c_{i} — the type of the corresponding operation. If c_{i} is equal to '+' or '-' then it's followed by a space and an integer a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 10^18) given without leading zeroes (unless it's 0). If c_{i} equals '?' then it's followed by a space and a sequence of zeroes and onse, giving the pattern of length no more than 18.

It's guaranteed that there will be at least one query of type '?'.

It's guaranteed that any time some integer is removed from the multiset, there will be at least one occurrence of this integer in it.

-----Output-----

For each query of the third type print the number of integers matching the given pattern. Each integer is counted as many times, as it appears in the multiset at this moment of time.

-----Examples-----

You are given a string A. Find a string B, where B is a palindrome and A is a subsequence of B.

A subsequence of a string is a string that can be derived from it by deleting some (not necessarily consecutive) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, ""cotst"" is a subsequence of ""contest"".

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward or backward.

The length of string B should be at most 10^4. It is guaranteed that there always exists such string.

You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string B should not exceed 10^4.

-----Input-----

First line contains a string A (1 ≤ |A| ≤ 10^3) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where |A| is a length of A.

-----Output-----

Output single line containing B consisting of only lowercase Latin letters. You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string B should not exceed 10^4. If there are many possible B, print any of them.

-----Examples-----

Polycarpus is a system administrator. There are two servers under his strict guidance — a and b. To stay informed about the servers' performance, Polycarpus executes commands ""ping a"" and ""ping b"". Each ping command sends exactly ten packets to the server specified in the argument of the command. Executing a program results in two integers x and y (x + y = 10; x, y ≥ 0). These numbers mean that x packets successfully reached the corresponding server through the network and y packets were lost.

Today Polycarpus has performed overall n ping commands during his workday. Now for each server Polycarpus wants to know whether the server is ""alive"" or not. Polycarpus thinks that the server is ""alive"", if at least half of the packets that we send to this server reached it successfully along the network.

Help Polycarpus, determine for each server, whether it is ""alive"" or not by the given commands and their results.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of commands Polycarpus has fulfilled. Each of the following n lines contains three integers — the description of the commands. The i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers t_{i}, x_{i}, y_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 2; x_{i}, y_{i} ≥ 0; x_{i} + y_{i} = 10). If t_{i} = 1, then the i-th command is ""ping a"", otherwise the i-th command is ""ping b"". Numbers x_{i}, y_{i} represent the result of executing this command, that is, x_{i} packets reached the corresponding server successfully and y_{i} packets were lost.

It is guaranteed that the input has at least one ""ping a"" command and at least one ""ping b"" command.

-----Output-----

In the first line print string ""LIVE"" (without the quotes) if server a is ""alive"", otherwise print ""DEAD"" (without the quotes).

In the second line print the state of server b in the similar format.

-----Examples-----
Input
2

2 6 4

Output
LIVE

Input
3
1 0 10
2 0 10
1 10 0

Output

-----Note-----

Consider the first test case. There 10 packets were sent to server a, 5 of them reached it. Therefore, at least half of all packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network. Overall there were 10 packets sent to server b, 6 of them reached it. Therefore, at least half of all packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network.

Consider the second test case. There were overall 20 packages sent to server a, 10 of them reached it. Therefore, at least half of all packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network. Overall 10 packets were sent to server b, 0 of them reached it. Therefore, less than half of all packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network.

Sereja loves all sorts of algorithms. He has recently come up with a new algorithm, which receives a string as an input. Let's represent the input string of the algorithm as q = q_1q_2... q_{k}. The algorithm consists of two steps:

  Find any continuous subsequence (substring) of three characters of string q, which doesn't equal to either string ""zyx"", ""xzy"", ""yxz"". If q doesn't contain any such subsequence, terminate the algorithm, otherwise go to step 2.  Rearrange the letters of the found subsequence randomly and go to step 1. 

Sereja thinks that the algorithm works correctly on string q if there is a non-zero probability that the algorithm will be terminated. But if the algorithm anyway will work for infinitely long on a string, then we consider the algorithm to work incorrectly on this string.

Sereja wants to test his algorithm. For that, he has string s = s_1s_2... s_{n}, consisting of n characters. The boy conducts a series of m tests. As the i-th test, he sends substring s_{l}_{i}s_{l}_{i} + 1... s_{r}_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n) to the algorithm input. Unfortunately, the implementation of his algorithm works too long, so Sereja asked you to help. For each test (l_{i}, r_{i}) determine if the algorithm works correctly on this test or not.

-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string s, its length (n) doesn't exceed 10^5. It is guaranteed that string s only contains characters: 'x', 'y', 'z'.

The second line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of tests. Next m lines contain the tests. The i-th line contains a pair of integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n).

-----Output-----

For each test, print ""YES"" (without the quotes) if the algorithm works correctly on the corresponding test and ""NO"" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Leha plays a computer game, where is on each level is given a connected graph with n vertices and m edges. Graph can contain multiple edges, but can not contain self loops. Each vertex has an integer d_{i}, which can be equal to 0, 1 or  - 1. To pass the level, he needs to find a «good» subset of edges of the graph or say, that it doesn't exist. Subset is called «good», if by by leaving only edges from this subset in the original graph, we obtain the following: for every vertex i, d_{i} =  - 1 or it's degree modulo 2 is equal to d_{i}. Leha wants to pass the game as soon as possible and ask you to help him. In case of multiple correct answers, print any of them.

-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 3·10^5) — number of vertices and edges.

The second line contains n integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_{n} ( - 1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 1) — numbers on the vertices.

Each of the next m lines contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) — edges. It's guaranteed, that graph in the input is connected.

-----Output-----

Print  - 1 in a single line, if solution doesn't exist. Otherwise in the first line k — number of edges in a subset. In the next k lines indexes of edges. Edges are numerated in order as they are given in the input, starting from 1.

You've got a list of program warning logs. Each record of a log stream is a string in this format:  ""2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:MESSAGE"" (without the quotes). 

String ""MESSAGE"" consists of spaces, uppercase and lowercase English letters and characters ""!"", ""."", "","", ""?"". String ""2012-MM-DD"" determines a correct date in the year of 2012. String ""HH:MM:SS"" determines a correct time in the 24 hour format.

The described record of a log stream means that at a certain time the record has got some program warning (string ""MESSAGE"" contains the warning's description).

Your task is to print the first moment of time, when the number of warnings for the last n seconds was not less than m.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000).

The second and the remaining lines of the input represent the log stream. The second line of the input contains the first record of the log stream, the third line contains the second record and so on. Each record of the log stream has the above described format. All records are given in the chronological order, that is, the warning records are given in the order, in which the warnings appeared in the program. 

It is guaranteed that the log has at least one record. It is guaranteed that the total length of all lines of the log stream doesn't exceed 5·10^6 (in particular, this means that the length of some line does not exceed 5·10^6 characters). It is guaranteed that all given dates and times are correct, and the string 'MESSAGE"" in all records is non-empty.

-----Output-----

If there is no sought moment of time, print -1. Otherwise print a string in the format ""2012-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"" (without the quotes) — the first moment of time when the number of warnings for the last n seconds got no less than m.

For strings s and t, we will say that s and t are prefix-free when neither is a prefix of the other.
Let L be a positive integer. A set of strings S is a good string set when the following conditions hold true:
 - Each string in S has a length between 1 and L (inclusive) and consists of the characters 0 and 1.
 - Any two distinct strings in S are prefix-free.
We have a good string set S = \{ s_1, s_2, ..., s_N \}. Alice and Bob will play a game against each other. They will alternately perform the following operation, starting from Alice:
 - Add a new string to S. After addition, S must still be a good string set.
The first player who becomes unable to perform the operation loses the game. Determine the winner of the game when both players play optimally.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq L \leq 10^{18}
 - s_1, s_2, ..., s_N are all distinct.
 - { s_1, s_2, ..., s_N } is a good string set.
 - |s_1| + |s_2| + ... + |s_N| \leq 10^5

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

-----Output-----
If Alice will win, print Alice; if Bob will win, print Bob.

-----Sample Input-----

Zookeeper is buying a carton of fruit to feed his pet wabbit. The fruits are a sequence of apples and oranges, which is represented by a binary string $s_1s_2\ldots s_n$ of length $n$. $1$ represents an apple and $0$ represents an orange.

Since wabbit is allergic to eating oranges, Zookeeper would like to find the longest contiguous sequence of apples. Let $f(l,r)$ be the longest contiguous sequence of apples in the substring $s_{l}s_{l+1}\ldots s_{r}$. 

Help Zookeeper find $\sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r)$, or the sum of $f$ across all substrings.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^5)$.

 The next line contains a binary string $s$ of length $n$ $(s_i \in \{0,1\})$ 

-----Output-----

Print a single integer: $\sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r)$. 

-----Examples-----

Output
156

-----Note-----

In the first test, there are ten substrings. The list of them (we let $[l,r]$ be the substring $s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r$):  $[1,1]$: 0  $[1,2]$: 01  $[1,3]$: 011  $[1,4]$: 0110  $[2,2]$: 1  $[2,3]$: 11  $[2,4]$: 110  $[3,3]$: 1  $[3,4]$: 10  $[4,4]$: 0 

The lengths of the longest contiguous sequence of ones in each of these ten substrings are $0,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,0$ respectively. Hence, the answer is $0+1+2+2+1+2+2+1+1+0 = 12$.

You are an all-powerful being and you have created a rectangular world. In fact, your world is so bland that it could be represented by a $r \times c$ grid. Each cell on the grid represents a country. Each country has a dominant religion. There are only two religions in your world. One of the religions is called Beingawesomeism, who do good for the sake of being good. The other religion is called Pushingittoofarism, who do murders for the sake of being bad.

Oh, and you are actually not really all-powerful. You just have one power, which you can use infinitely many times! Your power involves missionary groups. When a missionary group of a certain country, say $a$, passes by another country $b$, they change the dominant religion of country $b$ to the dominant religion of country $a$.

In particular, a single use of your power is this:   You choose a horizontal $1 \times x$ subgrid or a vertical $x \times 1$ subgrid. That value of $x$ is up to you;  You choose a direction $d$. If you chose a horizontal subgrid, your choices will either be NORTH or SOUTH. If you choose a vertical subgrid, your choices will either be EAST or WEST;  You choose the number $s$ of steps;  You command each country in the subgrid to send a missionary group that will travel $s$ steps towards direction $d$. In each step, they will visit (and in effect convert the dominant religion of) all $s$ countries they pass through, as detailed above.  The parameters $x$, $d$, $s$ must be chosen in such a way that any of the missionary groups won't leave the grid. 

The following image illustrates one possible single usage of your power. Here, A represents a country with dominant religion Beingawesomeism and P represents a country with dominant religion Pushingittoofarism. Here, we've chosen a $1 \times 4$ subgrid, the direction NORTH, and $s = 2$ steps.  [Image] 

You are a being which believes in free will, for the most part. However, you just really want to stop receiving murders that are attributed to your name. Hence, you decide to use your powers and try to make Beingawesomeism the dominant religion in every country.

What is the minimum number of usages of your power needed to convert everyone to Beingawesomeism?

With god, nothing is impossible. But maybe you're not god? If it is impossible to make Beingawesomeism the dominant religion in all countries, you must also admit your mortality and say so.

-----Input-----

The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4$) denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $r$ and $c$ denoting the dimensions of the grid ($1 \le r, c \le 60$). The next $r$ lines each contains $c$ characters describing the dominant religions in the countries. In particular, the $j$-th character in the $i$-th line describes the dominant religion in the country at the cell with row $i$ and column $j$, where:  ""A"" means that the dominant religion is Beingawesomeism;  ""P"" means that the dominant religion is Pushingittoofarism. 

It is guaranteed that the grid will only contain ""A"" or ""P"" characters. It is guaranteed that the sum of the $r \cdot c$ in a single file is at most $3 \cdot 10^6$.

-----Output-----

For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of usages of your power needed to convert everyone to Beingawesomeism, or the string ""MORTAL"" (without quotes) if it is impossible to do so. 

-----Example-----

-----Note-----

In the first test case, it can be done in two usages, as follows:

Usage 1: [Image] 

Usage 2: [Image] 

In the second test case, it can be done with just one usage of the power. 

In the third test case, it is impossible to convert everyone to Beingawesomeism, so the answer is ""MORTAL"".

We have a tree with N vertices. The vertices are numbered 1, 2, ..., N. The i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ N - 1) edge connects the two vertices A_i and B_i.
Takahashi wrote integers into K of the vertices. Specifically, for each 1 ≦ j ≦ K, he wrote the integer P_j into vertex V_j. The remaining vertices are left empty. After that, he got tired and fell asleep.
Then, Aoki appeared. He is trying to surprise Takahashi by writing integers into all empty vertices so that the following condition is satisfied:
 - Condition: For any two vertices directly connected by an edge, the integers written into these vertices differ by exactly 1.
Determine if it is possible to write integers into all empty vertices so that the condition is satisfied. If the answer is positive, find one specific way to satisfy the condition.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
 - 1 ≦ K ≦ N
 - 1 ≦ A_i, B_i ≦ N (1 ≦ i ≦ N - 1)
 - 1 ≦ V_j ≦ N (1 ≦ j ≦ K) (21:18, a mistake in this constraint was corrected)
 - 0 ≦ P_j ≦ 10^5 (1 ≦ j ≦ K)
 - The given graph is a tree.
 - All v_j are distinct.

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
:
A_{N-1} B_{N-1}
K
V_1 P_1
V_2 P_2
:
V_K P_K

-----Output-----
If it is possible to write integers into all empty vertices so that the condition is satisfied, print Yes. Otherwise, print No.
If it is possible to satisfy the condition, print N lines in addition. The v-th (1 ≦ v ≦ N) of these N lines should contain the integer that should be written into vertex v. If there are multiple ways to satisfy the condition, any of those is accepted.

The figure below shows the tree when Takahashi fell asleep. For each vertex, the integer written beside it represents the index of the vertex, and the integer written into the vertex is the integer written by Takahashi.
Aoki can, for example, satisfy the condition by writing integers into the remaining vertices as follows:
This corresponds to Sample Output 1. Note that other outputs that satisfy the condition will also be accepted, such as:
Yes

There is a simple undirected graph with N vertices and M edges.
The vertices are numbered 1 through N, and the edges are numbered 1 through M.
Edge i connects Vertex U_i and V_i.
Also, Vertex i has two predetermined integers A_i and B_i.
You will play the following game on this graph.
First, choose one vertex and stand on it, with W yen (the currency of Japan) in your pocket.
Here, A_s \leq W must hold, where s is the vertex you choose.
Then, perform the following two kinds of operations any number of times in any order:
 - Choose one vertex v that is directly connected by an edge to the vertex you are standing on, and move to vertex v. Here, you need to have at least A_v yen in your pocket when you perform this move.
 - Donate B_v yen to the vertex v you are standing on. Here, the amount of money in your pocket must not become less than 0 yen.
You win the game when you donate once to every vertex.
Find the smallest initial amount of money W that enables you to win the game.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - N-1 \leq M \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq A_i,B_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq U_i < V_i \leq N
 - The given graph is connected and simple (there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices).

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
:
A_N B_N
U_1 V_1
U_2 V_2
:
U_M V_M

-----Output-----
Print the smallest initial amount of money W that enables you to win the game.

-----Sample Output-----

If you have 6 yen initially, you can win the game as follows:
 - Stand on Vertex 4. This is possible since you have not less than 6 yen.
 - Donate 2 yen to Vertex 4. Now you have 4 yen.
 - Move to Vertex 3. This is possible since you have not less than 4 yen.
 - Donate 1 yen to Vertex 3. Now you have 3 yen.
 - Move to Vertex 2. This is possible since you have not less than 1 yen.
 - Move to Vertex 1. This is possible since you have not less than 3 yen.
 - Donate 1 yen to Vertex 1. Now you have 2 yen.
 - Move to Vertex 2. This is possible since you have not less than 1 yen.
 - Donate 2 yen to Vertex 2. Now you have 0 yen.
If you have less than 6 yen initially, you cannot win the game. Thus, the answer is 6.

You are in charge of controlling a dam. The dam can store at most L liters of water. Initially, the dam is empty. Some amount of water flows into the dam every morning, and any amount of water may be discharged every night, but this amount needs to be set so that no water overflows the dam the next morning.
It is known that v_i liters of water at t_i degrees Celsius will flow into the dam on the morning of the i-th day.
You are wondering about the maximum possible temperature of water in the dam at noon of each day, under the condition that there needs to be exactly L liters of water in the dam at that time. For each i, find the maximum possible temperature of water in the dam at noon of the i-th day. Here, consider each maximization separately, that is, the amount of water discharged for the maximization of the temperature on the i-th day, may be different from the amount of water discharged for the maximization of the temperature on the j-th day (j≠i).
Also, assume that the temperature of water is not affected by anything but new water that flows into the dam. That is, when V_1 liters of water at T_1 degrees Celsius and V_2 liters of water at T_2 degrees Celsius are mixed together, they will become V_1+V_2 liters of water at \frac{T_1*V_1+T_2*V_2}{V_1+V_2} degrees Celsius, and the volume and temperature of water are not affected by any other factors.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≤ N ≤ 5*10^5
 - 1≤ L ≤ 10^9
 - 0≤ t_i ≤ 10^9(1≤i≤N)
 - 1≤ v_i ≤ L(1≤i≤N)

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N L
t_1 v_1
t_2 v_2
:
t_N v_N

-----Output-----
Print N lines. The i-th line should contain the maximum temperature such that it is possible to store L liters of water at that temperature in the dam at noon of the i-th day.
Each of these values is accepted if the absolute or relative error is at most 10^{-6}.

 - On the first day, the temperature of water in the dam is always 10 degrees: the temperature of the only water that flows into the dam on the first day.
 - 10 liters of water at 15 degrees of Celsius can be stored on the second day, by discharging 5 liters of water on the night of the first day, and mix the remaining water with the water that flows into the dam on the second day.
 - 10 liters of water at 13.2 degrees of Celsius can be stored on the third day, by discharging 8 liters of water on the night of the first day, and mix the remaining water with the water that flows into the dam on the second and third days.

Alice lives on a line. Today, she will travel to some place in a mysterious vehicle.
Initially, the distance between Alice and her destination is D. When she input a number x to the vehicle, it will travel in the direction of the destination by a distance of x if this move would shorten the distance between the vehicle and the destination, and it will stay at its position otherwise. Note that the vehicle may go past the destination when the distance between the vehicle and the destination is less than x.
Alice made a list of N numbers. The i-th number in this list is d_i. She will insert these numbers to the vehicle one by one.
However, a mischievous witch appeared. She is thinking of rewriting one number in the list so that Alice will not reach the destination after N moves.
She has Q plans to do this, as follows:
 - Rewrite only the q_i-th number in the list with some integer so that Alice will not reach the destination.
Write a program to determine whether each plan is feasible.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≤ N ≤ 5*10^5
 - 1≤ Q ≤ 5*10^5
 - 1≤ D ≤ 10^9
 - 1≤ d_i ≤ 10^9(1≤i≤N)
 - 1≤ q_i ≤ N(1≤i≤Q)
 - D and each d_i are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N D
d_1 d_2 ... d_N
Q
q_1 q_2 ... q_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain YES if the i-th plan is feasible, and NO otherwise.

-----Sample Input-----
4 10
3 4 3 3
2
4 3

-----Sample Output-----
NO
YES

For the first plan, Alice will already arrive at the destination by the first three moves, and therefore the answer is NO.
For the second plan, rewriting the third number in the list with 5 will prevent Alice from reaching the destination as shown in the following figure, and thus the answer is YES.

Takahashi has an ability to generate a tree using a permutation (p_1,p_2,...,p_n) of (1,2,...,n), in the following process:
First, prepare Vertex 1, Vertex 2, ..., Vertex N.
For each i=1,2,...,n, perform the following operation:
 - If p_i = 1, do nothing.
 - If p_i \neq 1, let j' be the largest j such that p_j < p_i. Span an edge between Vertex i and Vertex j'.
Takahashi is trying to make his favorite tree with this ability.
His favorite tree has n vertices from Vertex 1 through Vertex n, and its i-th edge connects Vertex v_i and w_i.
Determine if he can make a tree isomorphic to his favorite tree by using a proper permutation.
If he can do so, find the lexicographically smallest such permutation.

-----Notes-----
For the definition of isomorphism of trees, see wikipedia. Intuitively, two trees are isomorphic when they are the ""same"" if we disregard the indices of their vertices.

 - 1 \leq v_i, w_i \leq n

Masha and Grisha like studying sets of positive integers.

One day Grisha has written a set A containing n different integers a_{i} on a blackboard. Now he asks Masha to create a set B containing n different integers b_{j} such that all n^2 integers that can be obtained by summing up a_{i} and b_{j} for all possible pairs of i and j are different.

Both Masha and Grisha don't like big numbers, so all numbers in A are from 1 to 10^6, and all numbers in B must also be in the same range.

Help Masha to create the set B that satisfies Grisha's requirement.

-----Input-----

Input data contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).

Each test case is described in the following way: the first line of the description contains one integer n — the number of elements in A (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains n integers a_{i} — the elements of A (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^6). 

-----Output-----

For each test first print the answer:   NO, if Masha's task is impossible to solve, there is no way to create the required set B.  YES, if there is the way to create the required set. In this case the second line must contain n different positive integers b_{j} — elements of B (1 ≤ b_{j} ≤ 10^6). If there are several possible sets, output any of them.

Koa the Koala and her best friend want to play a game.

The game starts with an array $a$ of length $n$ consisting of non-negative integers. Koa and her best friend move in turns and each have initially a score equal to $0$. Koa starts.

Let's describe a move in the game:  During his move, a player chooses any element of the array and removes it from this array, xor-ing it with the current score of the player.

 More formally: if the current score of the player is $x$ and the chosen element is $y$, his new score will be $x \oplus y$. Here $\oplus$ denotes bitwise XOR operation.

 Note that after a move element $y$ is removed from $a$.

  The game ends when the array is empty. 

At the end of the game the winner is the player with the maximum score. If both players have the same score then it's a draw.

If both players play optimally find out whether Koa will win, lose or draw the game.

-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains the integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the length of $a$.

The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — elements of $a$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.

-----Output-----

For each test case print:  WIN if Koa will win the game.  LOSE if Koa will lose the game.  DRAW if the game ends in a draw.

-----Note-----

In testcase $1$ of the first sample we have:

$a = [1, 2, 2]$. Here Koa chooses $1$, other player has to choose $2$, Koa chooses another $2$. Score for Koa is $1 \oplus 2 = 3$ and score for other player is $2$ so Koa wins.

You have an array $a$ of length $n$. For every positive integer $x$ you are going to perform the following operation during the $x$-th second:

  Select some distinct indices $i_{1}, i_{2}, \ldots, i_{k}$ which are between $1$ and $n$ inclusive, and add $2^{x-1}$ to each corresponding position of $a$. Formally, $a_{i_{j}} := a_{i_{j}} + 2^{x-1}$ for $j = 1, 2, \ldots, k$. Note that you are allowed to not select any indices at all. 

You have to make $a$ nondecreasing as fast as possible. Find the smallest number $T$ such that you can make the array nondecreasing after at most $T$ seconds.

Array $a$ is nondecreasing if and only if $a_{1} \le a_{2} \le \ldots \le a_{n}$.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^{4}$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{5}$) — the length of array $a$. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of $n$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $10^{5}$.

The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ ($-10^{9} \le a_{i} \le 10^{9}$).

-----Output-----

For each test case, print the minimum number of seconds in which you can make $a$ nondecreasing.

-----Note-----

In the first test case, if you select indices $3, 4$ at the $1$-st second and $4$ at the $2$-nd second, then $a$ will become $[1, 7, 7, 8]$. There are some other possible ways to make $a$ nondecreasing in $2$ seconds, but you can't do it faster.

In the second test case, $a$ is already nondecreasing, so answer is $0$.

In the third test case, if you do nothing at first $2$ seconds and select index $2$ at the $3$-rd second, $a$ will become $[0, 0]$.

Roger is a robot. He has an arm that is a series of n segments connected to each other. The endpoints of the i-th segment are initially located at points (i - 1, 0) and (i, 0). The endpoint at (i - 1, 0) is colored red and the endpoint at (i, 0) is colored blue for all segments. Thus, the blue endpoint of the i-th segment is touching the red endpoint of the (i + 1)-th segment for all valid i.

Roger can move his arm in two different ways:   He can choose some segment and some value. This is denoted as choosing the segment number i and picking some positive l. This change happens as follows: the red endpoint of segment number i and segments from 1 to i - 1 are all fixed in place. Imagine a ray from the red endpoint to the blue endpoint. The blue endpoint and segments i + 1 through n are translated l units in the direction of this ray.

 [Image] [Image] 

In this picture, the red point labeled A and segments before A stay in place, while the blue point labeled B and segments after B gets translated.

 He can choose a segment and rotate it. This is denoted as choosing the segment number i, and an angle a. The red endpoint of the i-th segment will stay fixed in place. The blue endpoint of that segment and segments i + 1 to n will rotate clockwise by an angle of a degrees around the red endpoint.

 [Image] [Image] 

In this picture, the red point labeled A and segments before A stay in place, while the blue point labeled B and segments after B get rotated around point A. 

Roger will move his arm m times. These transformations are a bit complicated, and Roger easily loses track of where the blue endpoint of the last segment is. Help him compute the coordinates of the blue endpoint of the last segment after applying each operation. Note that these operations are cumulative, and Roger's arm may intersect itself arbitrarily during the moves.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input will contain two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 300 000) — the number of segments and the number of operations to perform.

Each of the next m lines contains three integers x_{i}, y_{i} and z_{i} describing a move. If x_{i} = 1, this line describes a move of type 1, where y_{i} denotes the segment number and z_{i} denotes the increase in the length. If x_{i} = 2, this describes a move of type 2, where y_{i} denotes the segment number, and z_{i} denotes the angle in degrees. (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 2, 1 ≤ y_{i} ≤ n, 1 ≤ z_{i} ≤ 359)

-----Output-----

Print m lines. The i-th line should contain two real values, denoting the coordinates of the blue endpoint of the last segment after applying operations 1, ..., i. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 4}.

Namely, let's assume that your answer for a particular value of a coordinate is a and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-4}$ for all coordinates.

-----Note-----

The following pictures shows the state of the arm after each operation. The coordinates of point F are printed after applying each operation. For simplicity, we only show the blue endpoints of a segment (with the exception for the red endpoint of the first segment). For instance, the point labeled B is the blue endpoint for segment 1 and also the red endpoint for segment 2.

Initial state:  [Image]  Extend segment 1 by 3.  [Image]  Rotate segment 3 by 90 degrees clockwise.  [Image]  Rotate segment 5 by 48 degrees clockwise.  [Image]  Extend segment 4 by 1.  [Image]

You are working for the Gryzzl company, headquartered in Pawnee, Indiana.

The new national park has been opened near Pawnee recently and you are to implement a geolocation system, so people won't get lost. The concept you developed is innovative and minimalistic. There will be $n$ antennas located somewhere in the park. When someone would like to know their current location, their Gryzzl hologram phone will communicate with antennas and obtain distances from a user's current location to all antennas.

Knowing those distances and antennas locations it should be easy to recover a user's location... Right? Well, almost. The only issue is that there is no way to distinguish antennas, so you don't know, which distance corresponds to each antenna. Your task is to find a user's location given as little as all antennas location and an unordered multiset of distances.

-----Input-----

The first line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10^5$) which is the number of antennas.

The following $n$ lines contain coordinates of antennas, $i$-th line contain two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($0 \leq x_i,y_i \leq 10^8$). It is guaranteed that no two antennas coincide.

The next line of input contains integer $m$ ($1 \leq n \cdot m \leq 10^5$), which is the number of queries to determine the location of the user.

Following $m$ lines contain $n$ integers $0 \leq d_1 \leq d_2 \leq \dots \leq d_n \leq 2 \cdot 10^{16}$ each. These integers form a multiset of squared distances from unknown user's location $(x;y)$ to antennas.

For all test cases except the examples it is guaranteed that all user's locations $(x;y)$ were chosen uniformly at random, independently from each other among all possible integer locations having $0 \leq x, y \leq 10^8$.

-----Output-----

For each query output $k$, the number of possible a user's locations matching the given input and then output the list of these locations in lexicographic order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $k$ over all points does not exceed $10^6$.

-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

As you see in the second example, although initially a user's location is picked to have non-negative coordinates, you have to output all possible integer locations.

There are $n$ cities in Berland and some pairs of them are connected by two-way roads. It is guaranteed that you can pass from any city to any other, moving along the roads. Cities are numerated from $1$ to $n$.

Two fairs are currently taking place in Berland — they are held in two different cities $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le n$; $a \ne b$).

Find the number of pairs of cities $x$ and $y$ ($x \ne a, x \ne b, y \ne a, y \ne b$) such that if you go from $x$ to $y$ you will have to go through both fairs (the order of visits doesn't matter). Formally, you need to find the number of pairs of cities $x,y$ such that any path from $x$ to $y$ goes through $a$ and $b$ (in any order).

Print the required number of pairs. The order of two cities in a pair does not matter, that is, the pairs $(x,y)$ and $(y,x)$ must be taken into account only once.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 4\cdot10^4$) — the number of test cases in the input. Next, $t$ test cases are specified.

The first line of each test case contains four integers $n$, $m$, $a$ and $b$ ($4 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$, $n - 1 \le m \le 5\cdot10^5$, $1 \le a,b \le n$, $a \ne b$) — numbers of cities and roads in Berland and numbers of two cities where fairs are held, respectively.

The following $m$ lines contain descriptions of roads between cities. Each of road description contains a pair of integers $u_i, v_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$) — numbers of cities connected by the road.

Each road is bi-directional and connects two different cities. It is guaranteed that from any city you can pass to any other by roads. There can be more than one road between a pair of cities.

The sum of the values of $n$ for all sets of input data in the test does not exceed $2\cdot10^5$. The sum of the values of $m$ for all sets of input data in the test does not exceed $5\cdot10^5$.

-----Output-----

Print $t$ integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the input.

N hotels are located on a straight line. The coordinate of the i-th hotel (1 \leq i \leq N) is x_i.
Tak the traveler has the following two personal principles:
 - He never travels a distance of more than L in a single day.
 - He never sleeps in the open. That is, he must stay at a hotel at the end of a day.
You are given Q queries. The j-th (1 \leq j \leq Q) query is described by two distinct integers a_j and b_j.
For each query, find the minimum number of days that Tak needs to travel from the a_j-th hotel to the b_j-th hotel following his principles.
It is guaranteed that he can always travel from the a_j-th hotel to the b_j-th hotel, in any given input.

There are $n$ athletes in front of you. Athletes are numbered from $1$ to $n$ from left to right. You know the strength of each athlete — the athlete number $i$ has the strength $s_i$.

You want to split all athletes into two teams. Each team must have at least one athlete, and each athlete must be exactly in one team.

You want the strongest athlete from the first team to differ as little as possible from the weakest athlete from the second team. Formally, you want to split the athletes into two teams $A$ and $B$ so that the value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$ is as small as possible, where $\max(A)$ is the maximum strength of an athlete from team $A$, and $\min(B)$ is the minimum strength of an athlete from team $B$.

For example, if $n=5$ and the strength of the athletes is $s=[3, 1, 2, 6, 4]$, then one of the possible split into teams is:   first team: $A = [1, 2, 4]$,  second team: $B = [3, 6]$. 

In this case, the value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$ will be equal to $|4-3|=1$. This example illustrates one of the ways of optimal split into two teams.

Print the minimum value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$.

-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.

Each test case consists of two lines. 

The first line contains positive integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 50$) — number of athletes. 

The second line contains $n$ positive integers $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$ ($1 \le s_i \le 1000$), where $s_i$ — is the strength of the $i$-th athlete. Please note that $s$ values may not be distinct.

-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer — the minimum value of $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$ with the optimal split of all athletes into two teams. Each of the athletes must be a member of exactly one of the two teams.

You are given an undirected unweighted graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges (which represents the map of Bertown) and the array of prices $p$ of length $m$. It is guaranteed that there is a path between each pair of vertices (districts).

Mike has planned a trip from the vertex (district) $a$ to the vertex (district) $b$ and then from the vertex (district) $b$ to the vertex (district) $c$. He can visit the same district twice or more. But there is one issue: authorities of the city want to set a price for using the road so if someone goes along the road then he should pay the price corresponding to this road (he pays each time he goes along the road). The list of prices that will be used $p$ is ready and they just want to distribute it between all roads in the town in such a way that each price from the array corresponds to exactly one road.

You are a good friend of Mike (and suddenly a mayor of Bertown) and want to help him to make his trip as cheap as possible. So, your task is to distribute prices between roads in such a way that if Mike chooses the optimal path then the price of the trip is the minimum possible. Note that you cannot rearrange prices after the start of the trip.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains five integers $n, m, a, b$ and $c$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n-1 \le m \le min(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5)$, $1 \le a, b, c \le n$) — the number of vertices, the number of edges and districts in Mike's trip.

The second line of the test case contains $m$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$ ($1 \le p_i \le 10^9$), where $p_i$ is the $i$-th price from the array.

The following $m$ lines of the test case denote edges: edge $i$ is represented by a pair of integers $v_i$, $u_i$ ($1 \le v_i, u_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$), which are the indices of vertices connected by the edge. There are no loops or multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair ($v_i, u_i$) there are no other pairs ($v_i, u_i$) or ($u_i, v_i$) in the array of edges, and for each pair $(v_i, u_i)$ the condition $v_i \ne u_i$ is satisfied. It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ (as well as the sum of $m$) does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $\sum m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).

-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer — the minimum possible price of Mike's trip if you distribute prices between edges optimally.

This problem is a version of problem D from the same contest with some additional constraints and tasks.

There are $n$ candies in a candy box. The type of the $i$-th candy is $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$). 

You have to prepare a gift using some of these candies with the following restriction: the numbers of candies of each type presented in a gift should be all distinct (i. e. for example, a gift having two candies of type $1$ and two candies of type $2$ is bad).

It is possible that multiple types of candies are completely absent from the gift. It is also possible that not all candies of some types will be taken to a gift.

You really like some of the candies and don't want to include them into the gift, but you want to eat them yourself instead. For each candy, a number $f_i$ is given, which is equal to $0$ if you really want to keep $i$-th candy for yourself, or $1$ if you don't mind including it into your gift. It is possible that two candies of the same type have different values of $f_i$.

You want your gift to be as large as possible, but you don't want to include too many of the candies you want to eat into the gift. So, you want to calculate the maximum possible number of candies that can be included into a gift, and among all ways to choose maximum number of candies, you want to maximize the number of candies having $f_i = 1$ in your gift.

You have to answer $q$ independent queries.

If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of candies.

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing two integers $a_i$ and $f_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$, $0 \le f_i \le 1$), where $a_i$ is the type of the $i$-th candy, and $f_i$ denotes whether you want to keep the $i$-th candy for yourself ($0$ if you want to keep it, $1$ if you don't mind giving it away).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all queries does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

-----Output-----

For each query print two integers:

  the maximum number of candies in a gift you can compose, according to the constraints in the statement;  the maximum number of candies having $f_i = 1$ in a gift you can compose that contains the maximum possible number of candies.

There is a rectangular grid of size $n \times m$. Each cell of the grid is colored black ('0') or white ('1'). The color of the cell $(i, j)$ is $c_{i, j}$. You are also given a map of directions: for each cell, there is a direction $s_{i, j}$ which is one of the four characters 'U', 'R', 'D' and 'L'.

  If $s_{i, j}$ is 'U' then there is a transition from the cell $(i, j)$ to the cell $(i - 1, j)$;  if $s_{i, j}$ is 'R' then there is a transition from the cell $(i, j)$ to the cell $(i, j + 1)$;  if $s_{i, j}$ is 'D' then there is a transition from the cell $(i, j)$ to the cell $(i + 1, j)$;  if $s_{i, j}$ is 'L' then there is a transition from the cell $(i, j)$ to the cell $(i, j - 1)$. 

It is guaranteed that the top row doesn't contain characters 'U', the bottom row doesn't contain characters 'D', the leftmost column doesn't contain characters 'L' and the rightmost column doesn't contain characters 'R'.

You want to place some robots in this field (at most one robot in a cell). The following conditions should be satisfied.

  Firstly, each robot should move every time (i.e. it cannot skip the move). During one move each robot goes to the adjacent cell depending on the current direction.  Secondly, you have to place robots in such a way that there is no move before which two different robots occupy the same cell (it also means that you cannot place two robots in the same cell). I.e. if the grid is ""RL"" (one row, two columns, colors does not matter there) then you can place two robots in cells $(1, 1)$ and $(1, 2)$, but if the grid is ""RLL"" then you cannot place robots in cells $(1, 1)$ and $(1, 3)$ because during the first second both robots will occupy the cell $(1, 2)$. 

The robots make an infinite number of moves.

Your task is to place the maximum number of robots to satisfy all the conditions described above and among all such ways, you have to choose one where the number of black cells occupied by robots before all movements is the maximum possible. Note that you can place robots only before all movements.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 < nm \le 10^6$) — the number of rows and the number of columns correspondingly.

The next $n$ lines contain $m$ characters each, where the $j$-th character of the $i$-th line is $c_{i, j}$ ($c_{i, j}$ is either '0' if the cell $(i, j)$ is black or '1' if the cell $(i, j)$ is white).

The next $n$ lines also contain $m$ characters each, where the $j$-th character of the $i$-th line is $s_{i, j}$ ($s_{i, j}$ is 'U', 'R', 'D' or 'L' and describes the direction of the cell $(i, j)$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the sizes of fields does not exceed $10^6$ ($\sum nm \le 10^6$).

-----Output-----

For each test case, print two integers — the maximum number of robots you can place to satisfy all the conditions described in the problem statement and the maximum number of black cells occupied by robots before all movements if the number of robots placed is maximized. Note that you can place robots only before all movements.

You are given an undirected unweighted connected graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.

Your task is to choose at most $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ vertices in this graph so each unchosen vertex is adjacent (in other words, connected by an edge) to at least one of chosen vertices.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

You will be given multiple independent queries to answer.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries.

Then $t$ queries follow.

The first line of each query contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n - 1 \le m \le min(2 \cdot 10^5, \frac{n(n-1)}{2})$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

The following $m$ lines denote edges: edge $i$ is represented by a pair of integers $v_i$, $u_i$ ($1 \le v_i, u_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$), which are the indices of vertices connected by the edge.

There are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair ($v_i, u_i$) there are no other pairs ($v_i, u_i$) or ($u_i, v_i$) in the list of edges, and for each pair ($v_i, u_i$) the condition $v_i \ne u_i$ is satisfied. It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected.

It is guaranteed that $\sum m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$ over all queries.

-----Output-----

For each query print two lines.

In the first line print $k$ ($1 \le \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$) — the number of chosen vertices.

In the second line print $k$ distinct integers $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k$ in any order, where $c_i$ is the index of the $i$-th chosen vertex.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

Polygon is not only the best platform for developing problems but also a square matrix with side $n$, initially filled with the character 0.

On the polygon, military training was held. The soldiers placed a cannon above each cell in the first row and a cannon to the left of each cell in the first column. Thus, exactly $2n$ cannons were placed. [Image] Initial polygon for $n=4$. 

Cannons shoot character 1. At any moment of time, no more than one cannon is shooting. When a 1 flies out of a cannon, it flies forward (in the direction of the shot) until it collides with a polygon border or another 1. After that, it takes the cell in which it was before the collision and remains there. Take a look at the examples for better understanding.

More formally:   if a cannon stands in the row $i$, to the left of the first column, and shoots with a 1, then the 1 starts its flight from the cell ($i, 1$) and ends in some cell ($i, j$);  if a cannon stands in the column $j$, above the first row, and shoots with a 1, then the 1 starts its flight from the cell ($1, j$) and ends in some cell ($i, j$). 

For example, consider the following sequence of shots: [Image] 

 1. Shoot the cannon in the row $2$.                         2. Shoot the cannon in the row $2$.                         3. Shoot the cannon in column $3$. 

You have a report from the military training on your desk. This report is a square matrix with side length $n$ consisting of 0 and 1. You wonder if the training actually happened. In other words, is there a sequence of shots such that, after the training, you get the given matrix?

Each cannon can make an arbitrary number of shots. Before the training, each cell of the polygon contains 0.

-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

Each test case starts with a line containing an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$) — the size of the polygon.

This is followed by $n$ lines of length $n$, consisting of 0 and 1 — the polygon matrix after the training.

The total area of the matrices in all test cases in one test does not exceed $10^5$.

-----Output-----

For each test case print:  YES if there is a sequence of shots leading to a given matrix;  NO if such a sequence does not exist. 

The letters in the words YES and NO can be printed in any case.

The round carousel consists of $n$ figures of animals. Figures are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in order of the carousel moving. Thus, after the $n$-th figure the figure with the number $1$ follows. Each figure has its own type — the type of the animal corresponding to this figure (the horse, the tiger and so on). The type of animal of the $i$-th figure equals $t_i$. [Image] The example of the carousel for $n=9$ and $t=[5, 5, 1, 15, 1, 5, 5, 1, 1]$. 

You want to color each figure in one of the colors. You think that it's boring if the carousel contains two different figures (with the distinct types of animals) going one right after another and colored in the same color.

Your task is to color the figures in such a way that the number of distinct colors used is the minimum possible and there are no figures of the different types going one right after another and colored in the same color. If you use exactly $k$ distinct colors, then the colors of figures should be denoted with integers from $1$ to $k$.

-----Input-----

The input contains one or more test cases.

The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $q$ test cases follow. One test case is given on two lines.

The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of figures in the carousel. Figures are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in order of carousel moving. Assume that after the $n$-th figure the figure $1$ goes.

The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $t_1, t_2, \dots, t_n$ ($1 \le t_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $t_i$ is the type of the animal of the $i$-th figure.

The sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\cdot10^5$.

-----Output-----

Print $q$ answers, for each test case print two lines.

In the first line print one integer $k$ — the minimum possible number of distinct colors of figures.

In the second line print $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$ ($1 \le c_i \le k$), where $c_i$ is the color of the $i$-th figure. If there are several answers, you can print any.

You're now a baseball game point recorder.

Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:

Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
""+"" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
""D"" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
""C"" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.

Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.

You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.

Example 1:

Input: [""5"",""2"",""C"",""D"",""+""]
Output: 30
Explanation: 
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get 2 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 2's data was invalid. The sum is: 5.  
Round 3: You could get 10 points (the round 2's data has been removed). The sum is: 15.
Round 4: You could get 5 + 10 = 15 points. The sum is: 30.

Example 2:

Input: [""5"",""-2"",""4"",""C"",""D"",""9"",""+"",""+""]
Output: 27
Explanation: 
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get -2 points. The sum is: 3.
Round 3: You could get 4 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 3's data is invalid. The sum is: 3.  
Round 4: You could get -4 points (the round 3's data has been removed). The sum is: -1.
Round 5: You could get 9 points. The sum is: 8.
Round 6: You could get -4 + 9 = 5 points. The sum is 13.
Round 7: You could get 9 + 5 = 14 points. The sum is 27.

Note:
The size of the input list will be between 1 and 1000.
Every integer represented in the list will be between -30000 and 30000.

Given an array of integers nums, write a method that returns the ""pivot"" index of this array.

We define the pivot index as the index where the sum of the numbers to the left of the index is equal to the sum of the numbers to the right of the index.

If no such index exists, we should return -1. If there are multiple pivot indexes, you should return the left-most pivot index.

Example 1:

Input: 
nums = [1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The sum of the numbers to the left of index 3 (nums[3] = 6) is equal to the sum of numbers to the right of index 3.
Also, 3 is the first index where this occurs.

Example 2:

Input: 
nums = [1, 2, 3]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.

Note:
The length of nums will be in the range [0, 10000].
Each element nums[i] will be an integer in the range [-1000, 1000].

Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid.
Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ("" "").
The first player A always places ""X"" characters, while the second player B always places ""O"" characters.
""X"" and ""O"" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given an array moves where each element is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which A and B play.
Return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B), in case the game ends in a draw return ""Draw"", if there are still movements to play return ""Pending"".
You can assume that moves is valid (It follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty and A will play first.

Example 1:
Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: ""A""
Explanation: ""A"" wins, he always plays first.

Example 2:
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: ""B""
Explanation: ""B"" wins.

Example 3:
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
Output: ""Draw""
Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.
""XXO""
""OOX""

On an 8 x 8 chessboard, there is one white rook.  There also may be empty squares, white bishops, and black pawns.  These are given as characters 'R', '.', 'B', and 'p' respectively. Uppercase characters represent white pieces, and lowercase characters represent black pieces.
The rook moves as in the rules of Chess: it chooses one of four cardinal directions (north, east, west, and south), then moves in that direction until it chooses to stop, reaches the edge of the board, or captures an opposite colored pawn by moving to the same square it occupies.  Also, rooks cannot move into the same square as other friendly bishops.
Return the number of pawns the rook can capture in one move.

.remove(x)

This operation removes element x from the set.
If element x does not exist, it raises a KeyError.
The .remove(x) operation returns None.

Example

>>> s = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> s.remove(5)
>>> print s
set([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> print s.remove(4)
None
>>> print s
set([1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> s.remove(0)
KeyError: 0

.discard(x)

This operation also removes element x from the set.
If element x does not exist, it does not raise a KeyError.
The .discard(x) operation returns None.

Example

>>> s = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> s.discard(5)
>>> print s

itertools.product()

This tool computes the cartesian product of input iterables.
It is equivalent to nested for-loops.
For example, product(A, B) returns the same as ((x,y) for x in A for y in B).

Sample Code

>>> from itertools import product
>>>
>>> print list(product([1,2,3],repeat = 2))
[(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]

[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)]
>>>
>>> A = [[1,2,3],[3,4,5]]
>>> print list(product(*A))
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]

=====Function Descriptions=====
A set is an unordered collection of elements without duplicate entries.
When printed, iterated or converted into a sequence, its elements will appear in an arbitrary order.

=====Example=====
>>> print set()
set([])

>>> print set('HackerRank')
set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n', 'r', 'R'])

>>> print set([1,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,0,9,12,22,3])
set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 22])

>>> print set((1,2,3,4,5,5))
set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

>>> print set(set(['H','a','c','k','e','r','r','a','n','k']))
set(['a', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n'])

>>> print set({'Hacker' : 'DOSHI', 'Rank' : 616 })
set(['Hacker', 'Rank'])

>>> print set(enumerate(['H','a','c','k','e','r','r','a','n','k']))
set([(6, 'r'), (7, 'a'), (3, 'k'), (4, 'e'), (5, 'r'), (9, 'k'), (2, 'c'), (0, 'H'), (1, 'a'), (8, 'n')])

Basically, sets are used for membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries.

=====Function Descriptions=====
Transpose

We can generate the transposition of an array using the tool numpy.transpose.
It will not affect the original array, but it will create a new array.

import numpy

my_array = numpy.array([[1,2,3],
                        [4,5,6]])
print numpy.transpose(my_array)

#Output
[[1 4]
 [2 5]
 [3 6]]

Flatten

The tool flatten creates a copy of the input array flattened to one dimension.

import numpy

my_array = numpy.array([[1,2,3],
                        [4,5,6]])

=====Problem Statement=====
A valid postal code P have to fullfil both below requirements:

1. P must be a number in the range from 100000 to 999999 inclusive.
2. P must not contain more than one alternating repetitive digit pair.

Alternating repetitive digits are digits which repeat immediately after the next digit. In other words, an alternating repetitive digit pair is formed by two equal digits that have just a single digit between them.

For example:

121426 # Here, 1 is an alternating repetitive digit.
523563 # Here, NO digit is an alternating repetitive digit.
552523 # Here, both 2 and 5 are alternating repetitive digits.

Your task is to provide two regular expressions regex_integer_in_range and regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair. Where:

regex_integer_in_range should match only integers range from 100000 to 999999 inclusive

regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair should find alternating repetitive digits pairs in a given string.

Both these regular expressions will be used by the provided code template to check if the input string P is a valid postal code using the following expression:
(bool(re.match(regex_integer_in_range, P)) 
and len(re.findall(regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair, P)) < 2)

=====Input Format=====
Locked stub code in the editor reads a single string denoting P from stdin and uses provided expression and your regular expressions to validate if P is a valid postal code.

=====Problem Statement=====
When users post an update on social media,such as a URL, image, status update etc., other users in their network are able to view this new post on their news feed. Users can also see exactly when the post was published, i.e, how many hours, minutes or seconds ago.
Since sometimes posts are published and viewed in different time zones, this can be confusing. You are given two timestamps of one such post that a user can see on his newsfeed in the following format:
Day dd Mon yyyy hh:mm:ss +xxxx
Here +xxxx represents the time zone. Your task is to print the absolute difference (in seconds) between them.

=====Input Format=====
The first line contains T, the number of tescases.
Each testcase contains 2 lines, representing time t_1 and time t_2.

Pete and his mate Phil are out in the countryside shooting clay pigeons with a shotgun - amazing fun. 

They decide to have a competition. 3 rounds, 2 shots each. Winner is the one with the most hits.

Some of the clays have something attached to create lots of smoke when hit, guarenteed by the packaging to generate 'real excitement!' (genuinely this happened). None of the explosive things actually worked, but for this kata lets say they did.

For each round you will receive the following format:

[{P1:'XX', P2:'XO'}, true]

That is an array containing an object and a boolean. Pl represents Pete, P2 represents Phil. X represents a hit and O represents a miss. If the boolean is true, any hit is worth 2. If it is false, any hit is worth 1.

Find out who won. If it's Pete, return 'Pete Wins!'. If it is Phil, return 'Phil Wins!'. If the scores are equal, return 'Draw!'.

Note that as there are three rounds, the actual input (x) will look something like this:

[[{P1:'XX', P2:'XO'}, true], [{P1:'OX', P2:'OO'}, false], [{P1:'XX', P2:'OX'}, true]]

Help a fruit packer sort out the bad apples. 

There are 7 varieties of apples, all packaged as pairs and stacked in a fruit box. Some of the apples are spoiled. The fruit packer will have to make sure the spoiled apples are either removed from the fruit box or replaced. Below is the breakdown:

Apple varieties are represented with numbers, `1 to 7`

A fruit package is represented with a 2 element array `[4,3]`

A fruit package with one bad apple, or a bad package, is represented with `[2,0]` or `[0,2]`

A fruit package with two bad apples, or a rotten package, is represented with `[0,0]`

A fruit box is represented with:

```
[ [ 1, 3 ],
  [ 7, 6 ],
  [ 7, 2 ],
  [ 1, 3 ],
  [ 0, 2 ],
  [ 4, 5 ],
  [ 0, 3 ],
  [ 7, 6 ] ]

```

Write a program to clear the fruit box off bad apples. 

The INPUT will be a fruit box represented with a 2D array: `[[1,3],[7,6],[7,2],[1,3],[0,2],[4,5],[0,3],[7,6]]`

The OUTPUT should be the fruit box void of bad apples: `[[1,3],[7,6],[7,2],[1,3],[2,3],[4,5],[7,6]]`

Conditions to be met:

1.A bad package should have the bad apple replaced if there is another bad package with a good apple to spare. Else, the bad package should be discarded.

2.The order of the packages in the fruit box should be preserved. Repackaging happens from the top of the fruit box `index = 0` to the bottom `nth index`. Also note how fruits in a package are ordered when repacking. Example shown in INPUT/OUPUT above.

3.Rotten packages should be discarded. 

4.There can be packages with the same variety of apples, e.g `[1,1]`, this is not a problem.

It's tricky keeping track of who is owed what when spending money in a group. Write a function to balance the books.

* The function should take one parameter: an object/dict with two or more name-value pairs which represent the members of the group and the amount spent by each.
* The function should return an object/dict with the same names, showing how much money the members should pay or receive.

**Further points:**

* The values should be positive numbers if the person should receive money from the group, negative numbers if they owe money to the group.
* If value is a decimal, round to two decimal places.

Translations and comments (and upvotes!) welcome.

### Example

3 friends go out together: A spends £20, B spends £15, and C spends £10. The function should return an object/dict showing that A should receive £5, B should receive £0, and C should pay £5.

In this Kata, you will be given a string that has lowercase letters and numbers. Your task is to compare the number groupings and return the largest number. Numbers will not have leading zeros. 

For example, `solve(""gh12cdy695m1"") = 695`, because this is the largest of all number groupings. 

Good luck!

In this kata the function returns an array/list like the one passed to it but with its nth element removed (with `0 <= n <= array/list.length - 1`). The function is already written for you and the basic tests pass, but random tests fail. Your task is to figure out why and fix it.

Good luck!

Paul is an excellent coder and sits high on the CW leaderboard. He solves kata like a banshee but would also like to lead a normal life, with other activities. But he just can't stop solving all the kata!!

Given an array (x) you need to calculate the Paul Misery Score. The values are worth the following points:

kata = 5
Petes kata = 10
life = 0
eating = 1

The Misery Score is the total points gained from the array. Once you have the total, return as follows:

## Your Story
""A *piano* in the home meant something."" - *Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe*

You've just realized a childhood dream by getting a beautiful and beautiful-sounding upright piano from a friend who was leaving the country. You immediately started doing things like playing ""Heart and Soul"" over and over again, using one finger to pick out any melody that came into your head, requesting some sheet music books from the library, signing up for some MOOCs like Developing Your Musicianship, and wondering if you will think of any good ideas for writing piano-related katas and apps. 

Now you're doing an exercise where you play the very first (leftmost, lowest in pitch) key on the 88-key keyboard, which (as shown below) is white, with the little finger on your left hand, then the second key, which is black, with the ring finger on your left hand, then the third key, which is white, with the middle finger on your left hand, then the fourth key, also white, with your left index finger, and then the fifth key, which is black, with your left thumb. Then you play the sixth key, which is white, with your right thumb, and continue on playing the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth keys with the other four fingers of your right hand. Then for the eleventh key you go back to your left little finger, and so on. Once you get to the rightmost/highest, 88th, key, you start all over again with your left little finger on the first key. Your thought is that this will help you to learn to move smoothly and with uniform pressure on the keys from each finger to the next and back and forth between hands.

You're not saying the names of the notes while you're doing this, but instead just counting each key press out loud (not starting again at 1 after 88, but continuing on to 89 and so forth) to try to keep a steady rhythm going and to see how far you can get before messing up. You move gracefully and with flourishes, and between screwups you hear, see, and feel that you are part of some great repeating progression between low and high notes and black and white keys. 

## Your Function
The function you are going to write is not actually going to help you with your piano playing, but just explore one of the patterns you're experiencing: Given the number you stopped on, was it on a black key or a white key? For example, in the description of your piano exercise above, if you stopped at 5, your left thumb would be on the fifth key of the piano, which is black. Or if you stopped at 92, you would have gone all the way from keys 1 to 88 and then wrapped around, so that you would be on the fourth key, which is white.

Your function will receive an integer between 1 and 10000 (maybe you think that in principle it would be cool to count up to, say, a billion, but considering how many years it would take it is just not possible) and return the string ""black"" or ""white"" -- here are a few more examples:
```
1     ""white""
12    ""black""
42    ""white""
100   ""black""
2017  ""white""
```
Have fun! And if you enjoy this kata, check out the sequel: Piano Kata, Part 2

Write a function `take_umbrella()` that takes two arguments: a string representing the current weather and a float representing the chance of rain today.

Your function should return `True` or `False` based on the following criteria.

* You should take an umbrella if it's currently raining or if it's cloudy and the chance of rain is over `0.20`.
* You shouldn't take an umbrella if it's sunny unless it's more likely to rain than not.

The options for the current weather are `sunny`, `cloudy`, and `rainy`.

For example, `take_umbrella('sunny', 0.40)` should return `False`.

As an additional challenge, consider solving this kata using only logical operaters and not using any `if` statements.

# Introduction

You are the developer working on a website which features a large counter on its homepage, proudly displaying the number of happy customers who have downloaded your companies software.

You have been tasked with adding an effect to this counter to make it more interesting.  

Instead of just displaying the count value immediatley when the page loads, we want to create the effect of each digit cycling through its preceding numbers before stopping on the actual value.

# Task

As a step towards achieving this; you have decided to create a function that will produce a multi-dimensional array out of the hit count value.  Each inner dimension of the array represents an individual digit in the hit count, and will include all numbers that come before it, going back to 0.

## Rules
* The function will take one argument which will be a four character `string` representing hit count
* The function must return a multi-dimensional array containing four inner arrays
* The final value in each inner array must be the actual value to be displayed
* Values returned in the array must be of the type `number`

**Examples**

Create a function that takes a list of one or more non-negative integers, and arranges them such that they form the largest possible number.

Examples:

`largestArrangement([4, 50, 8, 145])` returns 8504145 (8-50-4-145)

`largestArrangement([4, 40, 7])` returns 7440 (7-4-40)

`largestArrangement([4, 46, 7])` returns 7464 (7-46-4)

`largestArrangement([5, 60, 299, 56])` returns 60565299 (60-56-5-299)

How many licks does it take to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop?

A group of engineering students from Purdue University reported that its licking machine, modeled after a human tongue, took an average of 364 licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop. Twenty of the group's volunteers assumed the licking challenge-unassisted by machinery-and averaged 252 licks each to the center.

Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to write a function that will return the number of licks it took to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop, given some environmental variables.

Everyone knows it's harder to lick a tootsie pop in cold weather but it's easier if the sun is out. You will be given an object of environmental conditions for each trial paired with a value that will increase or decrease the number of licks. The environmental conditions all apply to the same trial.

Assuming that it would normally take 252 licks to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop, return the new total of licks along with the condition that proved to be most challenging (causing the most added licks) in that trial.

Example:
```
totalLicks({ ""freezing temps"": 10, ""clear skies"": -2 });
```
Should return:
```
""It took 260 licks to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop. The toughest challenge was freezing temps.""
```
Other cases:
If there are no challenges, the toughest challenge sentence should be omitted. If there are multiple challenges with the highest toughest amount, the first one presented will be the toughest.
If an environment variable is present, it will be either a positive or negative integer. No need to validate.

Your job is to create a calculator which evaluates expressions in [Reverse Polish notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

For example expression `5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -` (which is equivalent to `5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) - 3` in normal notation) should evaluate to `14`.

For your convenience, the input is formatted such that a space is provided between every token.

Empty expression should evaluate to `0`.

Valid operations are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.

You may assume that there won't be exceptional situations (like stack underflow or division by zero).

Philip's just turned four and he wants to know how old he will be in various years in the future such as 2090 or 3044. His parents can't keep up calculating this so they've begged you to help them out by writing a programme that can answer Philip's endless questions.

Your task is to write a function that takes two parameters: the year of birth and the year to count years in relation to. As Philip is getting more curious every day he may soon want to know how many years it was until he would be born, so your function needs to work with both dates in the future and in the past.

Provide output in this format: For dates in the future: ""You are ... year(s) old."" For dates in the past: ""You will be born in ... year(s)."" If the year of birth equals the year requested return: ""You were born this very year!""

""..."" are to be replaced by the number, followed and proceeded by a single space. Mind that you need to account for both ""year"" and ""years"", depending on the result.

Good Luck!

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the ""instructions"" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols ""A"" and ""T"" are complements of each other, as ""C"" and ""G"". 
You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

A Magic Square contains the integers 1 to n^(2), arranged in an n by n array such that the columns, rows and both main diagonals add up to the same number.For doubly even positive integers (multiples of 4) the following method can be used to create a magic square.
Fill an array with the numbers 1 to n^(2) in succession. Then, for each 4 by 4 subarray, replace the entries on the blue and red diagonals by n^(2)+1-aij.
So, in the following example, a11 (row 1, column 1) was initially 1 and is replaced by 8^(2)+1-1 = 64

Taking into consideration the [3.5 edition rules](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ability_Scores#Table:_Ability_Modifiers_and_Bonus_Spells), your goal is to build a function that takes an ability score (worry not about validation: it is always going to be a non negative integer), will return:

* attribute modifier, as indicated on the table of the above link;
* maximum spell level for the spells you can cast (-1 for no spells at all) with that score;
* the eventual extra spells you might get (as an array/list, with elements representing extra spells for 1st, 2nd,... spell level in order; empty array for no extra spells).

The result needs to be an object (associative array in PHP), as shown in the examples:

```python
char_attribute(0) == {""modifier"": 0, ""maximum_spell_level"": -1, ""extra_spells"": []}
char_attribute(1) == {""modifier"": -5, ""maximum_spell_level"": -1, ""extra_spells"": []}
char_attribute(5) == {""modifier"": -3, ""maximum_spell_level"": -1, ""extra_spells"": []}
char_attribute(10) == {""modifier"": 0, ""maximum_spell_level"": 0, ""extra_spells"": []}
char_attribute(20) == {""modifier"": +5, ""maximum_spell_level"": 9, ""extra_spells"": [2,1,1,1,1]}
```

*Note: I didn't explain things in detail and just pointed out to the table on purpose, as my goal is also to train the pattern recognition skills of whoever is going to take this challenges, so do not complain about a summary description. Thanks :)*

You're about to go on a trip around the world! On this trip you're bringing your trusted backpack, that anything fits into. The bad news is that the airline has informed you, that your luggage cannot exceed a certain amount of weight.

To make sure you're bringing your most valuable items on this journey you've decided to give all your items a score that represents how valuable this item is to you. It's your job to pack you bag so that you get the most value out of the items that you decide to bring.

Your input will consist of two arrays, one for the scores and one for the weights. You input will always be valid lists of equal length, so you don't have to worry about verifying your input.

You'll also be given a maximum weight. This is the weight that your backpack cannot exceed.

For instance, given these inputs:

    scores = [15, 10, 9, 5]
    weights = [1, 5, 3, 4]
    capacity = 8

The maximum score will be ``29``. This number comes from bringing items ``1, 3 and 4``.

Note: Your solution will have to be efficient as the running time of your algorithm will be put to a test.

# Task
 You have two sorted arrays `a` and `b`, merge them to form new array of unique items.

 If an item is present in both arrays, it should be part of the resulting array if and only if it appears in both arrays the same number of times.

# Example

  For `a = [1, 3, 40, 40, 50, 60, 60, 60]` and `b = [2, 40, 40, 50, 50, 65]`, the result should be `[1, 2, 3, 40, 60, 65]`.
```
Number 40 appears 2 times in both arrays, 
thus it is in the resulting array.
Number 50 appears once in array a and twice in array b, 
therefore it is not part of the resulting array.```

# Input/Output

 - `[input]` integer array `a`

 A sorted array.

 1 ≤ a.length ≤ 500000

 - `[input]` integer array `b`

 A sorted array.

 `1 ≤ b.length ≤ 500000`

# Convert a linked list to a string

## Related Kata

Although this Kata is not part of an official Series, you may also want to try out [Parse a linked list from a string](https://www.codewars.com/kata/582c5382f000e535100001a7) if you enjoyed this Kata.

## Preloaded

Preloaded for you is a class, struct or derived data type `Node` (depending on the language) used to construct linked lists in this Kata:

```python
class Node():
    def __init__(self, data, next = None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next
```

~~~if:objc
*NOTE: In Objective-C, the* `Node` *struct is placed on top of your main solution because there is a ""double-import"" bug in the Preloaded section at the time of writing (which cannot be fixed on my end).  Attempts to modify it (e.g. to cheat the tests in some way) will likely result in a test crash so it is not recommended for you to modify that section ;)*
~~~

~~~if:c
*NOTE: In C, the* `Node` *struct is placed on top of your main solution (and the [Sample] Test Cases) because the compiler complains about not recognizing the* `Node` *datatype even after adding it to the Preloaded section.  Attempts to modify it (e.g. to cheat the tests in some way) will likely result in a test crash so it is not recommended for you to modify that section ;)*
~~~

If you are attempting this Kata in NASM then note that the code example shown directly above may not be relevant; please refer to the Sample Tests (written in C) for the exact definition of the `Node` structure.

## Prerequisites

This Kata assumes that you are already familiar with the idea of a linked list.  If you do not know what that is, you may want to read up on [this article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list).  Specifically, the linked lists this Kata is referring to are **singly linked lists**, where the value of a specific node is stored in its `data`/`$data`/`Data` property, the reference to the next node is stored in its `next`/`$next`/`Next`/`next_node` property and the terminator for a list is `null`/`NULL`/`None`/`nil`/`nullptr`/`null()`.

## Task

*If you are attempting this Kata in NASM, the code examples shown below may not be relevant at all - please refer to the Sample Tests (written in C) for the exact requirements.*

Create a function `stringify` which accepts an argument `list`/`$list` and returns a string representation of the list.  The string representation of the list starts with the value of the current `Node`, specified by its `data`/`$data`/`Data` property, followed by a whitespace character, an arrow and another whitespace character (`"" -> ""`), followed by the rest of the list.  The end of the string representation of a list must always end with `null`/`NULL`/`None`/`nil`/`nullptr`/`null()` (all caps or all lowercase depending on the language you are undertaking this Kata in).  For example, given the following list:

```python
Node(1, Node(2, Node(3)))
```

... its string representation would be:

```python
""1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None""
```

And given the following linked list:

```python
Node(0, Node(1, Node(4, Node(9, Node(16)))))
```

... its string representation would be:

```python
""0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> None""
```

Note that `null`/`NULL`/`None`/`nil`/`nullptr`/`null()` itself is also considered a valid linked list.  In that case, its string representation would simply be `""null""`/`""NULL""`/`""None""`/`""nil""`/`""nullptr""`/`@""NULL""`/`""null()""` (again, depending on the language).

For the simplicity of this Kata, you may assume that any `Node` in this Kata may only contain **non-negative integer** values.  For example, you will not encounter a `Node` whose `data`/`$data`/`Data` property is `""Hello World""`.

Enjoy, and don't forget to check out my other Kata Series :D

*NOTE: In Fortran, your returned string is* **not** *permitted to contain any leading and/or trailing whitespace.*

# Task
 You are given a binary string (a string consisting of only '1' and '0'). The only operation that can be performed on it is a Flip operation. 

 It flips any binary character ( '0' to '1' and vice versa) and all characters to the `right` of it.

 For example, applying the Flip operation to the 4th character of string ""1001010"" produces the ""1000101"" string, since all characters from the 4th to the 7th are flipped.

 Your task is to find the minimum number of flips required to convert the binary string to string consisting of all '0'.

# Example

 For `s = ""0101""`, the output should be `3`.

 It's possible to convert the string in three steps:

 ```
 ""0101"" -> ""0010""
    ^^^
 ""0010"" -> ""0001""
     ^^
 ""0001"" -> ""0000""
      ^
 ```

# Input/Output

 - `[input]` string `s`

  A binary string.

 - `[output]` an integer

  The minimum number of flips required.

###Story
Sometimes we are faced with problems when we have a big nested dictionary with which it's hard to work. Now, we need to solve this problem by writing a function that will flatten a given dictionary.

###Info
Python dictionaries are a convenient data type to store and process configurations. They allow you to store data by keys to create nested structures. You are given a dictionary where the keys are strings and the values are strings or dictionaries. The goal is flatten the dictionary, but save the structures in the keys. The result should be a dictionary without the nested dictionaries. The keys should contain paths that contain the parent keys from the original dictionary. The keys in the path are separated by a `/`. If a value is an empty dictionary, then it should be replaced by an empty string `""""`.

###Examples
```python
{
    ""name"": {
        ""first"": ""One"",
        ""last"": ""Drone""
    },
    ""job"": ""scout"",
    ""recent"": {},
    ""additional"": {
        ""place"": {
            ""zone"": ""1"",
            ""cell"": ""2""
        }
    }
}
```
The result will be:
```python
{""name/first"": ""One"",           #one parent
 ""name/last"": ""Drone"",
 ""job"": ""scout"",                #root key
 ""recent"": """",                  #empty dict
 ""additional/place/zone"": ""1"",  #third level
 ""additional/place/cell"": ""2""}
```

***`Input: An original dictionary as a dict.`***
***`Output: The flattened dictionary as a dict.`***
***`Precondition:
Keys in a dictionary are non-empty strings.
Values in a dictionary are strings or dicts.
root_dictionary != {}`***

```python
flatten({""key"": ""value""}) == {""key"": ""value""}
flatten({""key"": {""deeper"": {""more"": {""enough"": ""value""}}}}) == {""key/deeper/more/enough"": ""value""}

Just another day in the world of Minecraft, Steve is working on his new project -- building a beacon pyramid in front of his house.

![Beacon pyramid](http://www.minecraft101.net/reference/images/beacon_pyramid_thb.jpg)

Steve has already obtained the beacon (the glass wrapped blue thingy on the top), he just needs to build the pyramid. Each level of the pyramid is built using one of the following four kinds of block: gold, diamond, emerald, and iron. Since these four kinds of blocks are relatively hard to collect, Steve needs to know exactly how many of each kind is required to build a pyramid of level N.

Assume that the top level of the pyramid uses gold blocks, the second level uses diamond blocks, the third level uses emerald blocks, the fourth level uses iron blocks, and the fifth level uses gold blocks, etc. (if you are a Minecraft player, you know it's not neccessary the right way to build the pyramid. Let's just assume it is for the sake of this kata ;-))

Implement a function that takes one argument which is the number of levels of the pyramid, and returns an object of the form: `{total: 9, gold: 9, diamond: 0, emerald: 0, iron: 0}`.

feel free to expand this series or let me know if you have any ideas related to Minecraft that can be turned into codewars puzzles. Some ideas I have that might potentially be turned into katas:

* distance traveled in real world vs. in Nether
* shortest path problems related to mining diamonds/gold/goodies that appears in different levels under ground
* growth of animal population from breeding
* redstone stuff?!

You have stumbled across the divine pleasure that is owning a dog and a garden. Now time to pick up all the cr@p! :D

Given a 2D array to represent your garden, you must find and collect all of the dog cr@p - represented by '@'.

You will also be given the number of bags you have access to (bags), and the capactity of a bag (cap). If there are no bags then you can't pick anything up, so you can ignore cap.

You need to find out if you have enough capacity to collect all the cr@p and make your garden clean again. 

If you do, return 'Clean', else return 'Cr@p'.

Watch out though - if your dog is out there ('D'), he gets very touchy about being watched. If he is there you need to return 'Dog!!'.

For example:

x=

Colour plays an important role in our lifes. Most of us like this colour better then another. User experience specialists believe that certain colours have certain psychological meanings for us.

You are given a 2D array, composed of a colour and its 'common' association in each array element. The function you will write needs to return the colour as 'key' and association as its 'value'.

For example:
```python
var array = [[""white"", ""goodness""], ...] returns [{'white': 'goodness'}, ...]
```

This kata is all about adding numbers.

You will create a function named add. It will return the sum of all the arguments. Sounds easy, doesn't it?

Well Here's the Twist. The inputs will gradually decrease with their index as parameter to the function.

```python
  add(3,4,6) #returns (3/1)+(4/2)+(6/3)=7
```

Remember the function will return 0 if no arguments are passed and it must round the result if sum is a float.

Example
```python
  add() #=> 0
  add(1,2,3) #=> 3
  add(1,4,-6,20) #=> 6
```

## Introduction

Each chemical element in its neutral state has a specific number of electrons associated with it. This is represented by the **atomic number** which is noted by an integer number next to or above each element of the periodic table (as highlighted in the image above).

As we move from left to right, starting from the top row of the periodic table, each element differs from its predecessor by 1 unit (electron). Electrons fill in different orbitals sets according to a specific order. Each set of orbitals, when full, contains an even number of electrons.

The orbital sets are:
* The _**s** orbital_ - a single orbital that can hold a maximum of 2 electrons.
* The _**p** orbital set_ - can hold 6 electrons.
* The _**d** orbital set_ - can hold 10 electrons.
* The _**f** orbital set_ - can hold 14 electrons.

The order in which electrons are filling the different set of orbitals is shown in the picture above. First electrons will occupy the **1s** orbital, then the **2s**, then the **2p** set, **3s** and so on.

Electron configurations show how the number of electrons of an element is distributed across each orbital set. Each orbital is written as a sequence that follows the order in the picture, joined by the number of electrons contained in that orbital set. The final electron configuration is a single string of orbital names and number of electrons per orbital set where the first 2 digits of each substring represent the orbital name followed by a number that states the number of electrons that the orbital set contains.

For example, a string that demonstrates an electron configuration of a chemical element that contains 10 electrons is: `1s2 2s2 2p6`. This configuration shows that there are two electrons in the `1s` orbital set, two electrons in the `2s` orbital set, and six electrons in the `2p` orbital set. `2 + 2 + 6 = 10` electrons total.

___

# Task

Your task is to write a function that displays the electron configuration built according to the Madelung rule of all chemical elements of the periodic table. The argument will be the symbol of a chemical element, as displayed in the periodic table.

**Note**: There will be a preloaded array called `ELEMENTS` with chemical elements sorted by their atomic number.

For example, when the element ""O"" is fed into the function the output should look like: 

`""O -> 1s2 2s2 2p4""`

However, there are some exceptions! The electron configurations of the elements below should end as:

```
Cr -> ...3d5 4s1
Cu -> ...3d10 4s1
Nb -> ...4d4 5s1
Mo -> ...4d5 5s1
Ru -> ...4d7 5s1
Rh -> ...4d8 5s1
Pd -> ...4d10 5s0
Ag -> ...4d10 5s1
La -> ...4f0 5d1
Ce -> ...4f1 5d1
Gd -> ...4f7 5d1 6s2
Pt -> ...4f14 5d9 6s1
Au -> ...4f14 5d10 6s1
Ac -> ...5f0 6d1 7s2
Th -> ...5f0 6d2 7s2
Pa -> ...5f2 6d1 7s2
U  -> ...5f3 6d1 7s2
Np -> ...5f4 6d1 7s2
Cm -> ...5f7 6d1 7s2
```

**Note**: for `Ni` the electron configuration should be `3d8 4s2` instead of `3d9 4s1`.

In this kata you need to create a function that takes a 2D array/list of non-negative integer pairs and returns the sum of all the ""saving"" that you can have getting the [LCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple) of each couple of number compared to their simple product.

For example, if you are given:
```
[[15,18], [4,5], [12,60]]
```
Their product would be:
```
[270, 20, 720]
```
While their respective LCM would be:
```
[90, 20, 60]
```
Thus the result should be:
```
(270-90)+(20-20)+(720-60)==840
```
This is a kata that I made, among other things, to let some of my trainees familiarize with the [euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm), a really neat tool to have on your belt ;)

You are given an array of non-negative integers, your task is to complete the series from 0 to the highest number in the array.

If the numbers in the sequence provided are not in order you should order them, but if a value repeats, then you must return a sequence with only one item, and the value of that item must be 0. like this:
```
inputs        outputs
[2,1]     ->  [0,1,2]
[1,4,4,6] ->  [0]

Laura Bassi was the first female professor at a European university.  
Despite her immense intellect, she was not always allowed to lecture publicly.

One day a professor with very strong beliefs against women in academia sent some `agents` to find Bassi and end her career.

Help her escape by telling her the safest places in town!

Task

```if:python,javascript
Implement the function `advice(agents, n)` where
```
```if:haskell
Implement the function `advice agents n :: [(Int,Int)] -> Int -> [(Int,Int)]` where
```
```if:swift
Implement the function `advice(agents: [[Int]], n: Int) -> [[Int]]` where
```

- `agents` is an array of agent coordinates.
- `n` defines the size of the city that Bassi needs to hide in, in other words the side length of the square grid. 

The function should return a list of coordinates that are the furthest away (by Manhattan distance) from all agents.

As an example, say you have a 6x6 map, and agents at locations

```python
[(0, 0), (1, 5), (5, 1)]
```

The distances to the nearest agent look like this.

The safest spaces are the ones with distance `4`, marked in bright red. So the function should return

```python
[(2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)]
```

in any order.

Edge cases:
- If there is an agent on every grid cell, there is no safe space, so return an empty list.
- If there are no agents, then every cell is a safe spaces, so return all coordinates.
- if `n` is `0`, return an empty list.
- If agent coordinates are outside of the map, they are simply not considered.
- There are no duplicate agents on the same square.

Performance

All reference solutions run in around 6 seconds.
You might not pass the tests if you use a brute-force solution.

```if-not:swift,javascript
There are `200` random tests with `n <= 50`. Inefficient solutions might time out.
```
```if:javascript
There are `300` random tests with `n <= 70`. Inefficient solutions might time out.
```
```if:swift
There are `200` random tests with `n <= 70`. Inefficient solutions might time out.
```

# Task
 You are a magician. You're going to perform a trick.

 You have `b` black marbles and `w` white marbles in your magic hat, and an infinite supply of black and white marbles that you can pull out of nowhere. 

 You ask your audience to repeatedly remove a pair of marbles from your hat and, for each pair removed, you add one marble to the hat according to the following rule until there is only 1 marble left. 

 If the marbles of the pair that is removed are of the same color, you add a white marble to the hat. Otherwise, if one is black and one is white, you add a black marble.

 Given the initial number of black and white marbles in your hat, your trick is to predict the color of the last marble.

 Note: A magician may confuse your eyes, but not your mind ;-)

# Input/Output

 - `[input]` integer `b`

  Initial number of black marbles in the hat. 

  `1 <= b <= 10^9`

 - `[input]` integer `w`

  Initial number of white marbles in the hat. 

  `1 <= w <= 10^9`

 - `[output]` a string

  `""Black""` or `""White""` if you can safely predict the color of the last marble. If not, return `""Unsure""`.

Reducing Problems - Bug Fixing #8

Oh no! Timmy's reduce is causing problems, Timmy's goal is to calculate the two teams scores and return the winner but timmy has gotten confused and sometimes teams don't enter their scores, total the scores out of 3! Help timmy fix his program!

Return true if team 1 wins or false if team 2 wins!

# Task
 You have some people who are betting money, and they all start with the same amount of money (this number>0). 

 Find out if the given end-state of amounts is possible after the betting is over and money is redistributed.

# Input/Output

 - `[input]` integer array arr

  the proposed end-state showing final amounts for each player

 - `[output]` a boolean value

  `true` if this is a possible end-state and `false` otherwise

# Examples

- For `arr = [0, 56, 100]`, the output should be `true`.

Three players start with the same amount of money 52.

At the end of game, player 1 lose `52`, player2 win `4`, and  player3 win `48`.

- For `arr = [0, 0, 0]`, the output should be `false`.

Players should start with a positive number of of money.

- For `arr = [11]`, the output should be `true`.

One player always keep his money at the end of game.

- For `arr = [100, 100, 100, 90, 1, 0, 0]`, the output should be `false`.

These players can not start with the same amount of money.

# Description
""It's the end of trick-or-treating and we have a list/array representing how much candy each child in our group has made out with. We don't want the kids to start arguing, and using our parental intuition we know trouble is brewing as many of the children in the group have received different amounts of candy from each home. 

So we want each child to have the same amount of candies, only we can't exactly take any candy away from the kids, that would be even worse. Instead we decide to give each child extra candy until they all have the same amount.
# Task
Your job is to find out how much candy each child has, and give them each additional candy until they too have as much as the child(ren) with the most candy. You also want to keep a total of how much candy you've handed out because reasons.""

Your job is to give all the kids the same amount of candies as the kid with the most candies and then return the total number candies that have been given out. If there are no kids, or only one, return -1. 

In the first case (look below) the most candies are given to second kid (i.e second place in list/array), 8. Because of that we will give the first kid 3 so he can have 8 and the third kid 2 and the fourth kid 4, so all kids will have 8 candies.So we end up handing out 3 + 2 + 4 = 9.

```python
candies ([5,8,6,4]) # return 9

candies ([1,2,4,6]) # return 11

candies ([1,6]) # return 5

candies ([]) # return -1

candies ([6]) # return -1 (because only one kid)
```
```cs
CandyProblem.GetMissingCandies(new [] {5, 6, 8, 4}) // return 9

CandyProblem.GetMissingCandies(new [] {1, 2, 4, 6}) // return 11

CandyProblem.GetMissingCandies(new [] { }) // return -1

CandyProblem.GetMissingCandies(new [] {1, 6}) // return 5

```
```haskell 
candies [5,8,6,4] -- return 9

candies [1,2,4,6] -- return 11

candies [] -- return -1

candies [1,6] -- return 5

In the board game Talisman, when two players enter combat the outcome is decided by a combat score, equal to the players power plus any modifiers plus the roll of a standard 1-6 dice. The player with the highest combat score wins and the opposing player loses a life. In the case of a tie combat ends with neither player losing a life.

For example:
```
Player 1: 5 Power, 0 Modifier
Player 2: 3 Power, 2 Modifier

Player 1 rolls a 4, Player 2 rolls a 2.

(5 + 0 + 4) -> (3 + 2 + 2)
Player 1 wins (9 > 7)
```

Your task is to write a method that calculates the required roll for the player to win.

The player and enemy stats are given as an array in the format:
```python
[power, modifier]
```

For example for the examples used above the stats would be given as:
```python
get_required([5, 0], [3, 2]) # returns 'Random'
```

If the player has at least 6 more power (including modifiers) than the enemy they automatically wins the fight, as the enemy's combat score couldn't possibly exceed the player's. In this instance the method should return ""Auto-win"".

For example:
```python
get_required([9, 0], [2, 1]) # returns 'Auto-win' as the enemy can't possibly win
```

If the enemy has at least 6 more power (including modifiers) than the player they automatically wins the fight, as the player's combat score couldn't possibly exceed the enemy's. In this instance the method should return ""Auto-lose"".

For example:
```python
get_required([2, 1], [9, 0]) # returns 'Auto-lose' as the player can't possibly win
```

If the player and enemy have the same power (including modifiers) the outcome is purely down to the dice roll, and hence would be considered completely random. In this instance the method should return ""Random"".

For example (as above):
```python
get_required([5, 0], [3, 2]) # returns 'Random' as it is purely down to the dice roll
```

If the player has greater power than the enemy (including modifiers) the player could guarantee a win by rolling a high enough number on the dice. In this instance the method should return a range equal to the numbers which would guarantee victory for the player.

```python
get_required([6, 0], [2, 2]) # returns '(5..6)' as rolling a 5 or 6 would mean the enemy could not win
get_required([7, 1], [2, 2]) # returns '(3..6)' as rolling anything 3 through 6 would mean the enemy could not win
```

If the player has less power than the enemy (including modifiers) the player can only win if the enemy rolls a low enough number, providing they then roll a high enough number. In this instance the method should return a range equal to the numbers which would allow the player a chance to win.

```python
get_required([4, 0], [6, 0]) # returns '(1..3)' as this would be the only outcome for which the player could still win
get_required([1, 1], [6, 0]) # returns '(1..1)' as this would be the only outcome for which the player could still win
```

If the better case scenario for the player is to hope for a tie, then return `""Pray for a tie!""`.

```python
get_required([7, 2], [6, 8]) # returns ""Pray for a tie!""
```

You like the way the Python `+` operator easily handles adding different numeric types, but you need a tool to do that kind of addition without killing your program with a `TypeError` exception whenever you accidentally try adding incompatible types like strings and lists to numbers.

You decide to write a function `my_add()` that takes two arguments. If the arguments can be added together it returns the sum. If adding the arguments together would raise an error the function should return `None` instead.

For example, `my_add(1, 3.414)` would return `4.414`, but `my_add(42, "" is the answer."")` would return `None`.

Hint: using a `try` / `except` statement may simplify this kata.

Based on [this kata, Connect Four.](https://www.codewars.com/kata/connect-four-1)

In this kata we play a modified game of connect four. It's connect X, and there can be multiple players.

Write the function ```whoIsWinner(moves,connect,size)```.

```2 <= connect <= 10```

```2 <= size <= 52```

Each column is identified by a character, A-Z a-z:  
``` ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ```

Moves come in the form:

```
['C_R','p_Y','s_S','I_R','Z_Y','d_S']
```
* Player R puts on C
* Player Y puts on p
* Player S puts on s
* Player R puts on I
* ...

The moves are in the order that they are played. 

The first player who connect ``` connect ``` items in same color is the winner. 

Note that a player can win before all moves are done. You should return the first winner.

If no winner is found, return ""Draw"".

A board with size 7, where yellow has connected 4:

# Remove Duplicates

You are to write a function called `unique` that takes an array of integers and returns the array with duplicates removed. It must return the values in the same order as first seen in the given array. Thus no sorting should be done, if 52 appears before 10 in the given array then it should also be that 52 appears before 10 in the returned array.

## Assumptions

* All values given are integers (they can be positive or negative).
* You are given an array but it may be empty.
* They array may have duplicates or it may not.

## Example

```python
print unique([1, 5, 2, 0, 2, -3, 1, 10])
[1, 5, 2, 0, -3, 10]

print unique([])
[]

Given a square matrix (i.e. an array of subarrays), find the sum of values from the first value of the first array, the second value of the second array, the third value of the third array, and so on...

## Examples

```
array = [[1, 2],
         [3, 4]]

diagonal sum: 1 + 4 = 5
```

```
array = [[5, 9, 1, 0],

         [1, 4, 1, 9],
         [2, 3, 8, 2]]

diagonal sum: 5 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 15
```

### Vaccinations for children under 5
You have been put in charge of administrating vaccinations for children in your local area. Write a function that will generate a list of vaccines for each child presented for vaccination, based on the child's age and vaccination history, and the month of the year.
#### The function takes three parameters: age, status and month
- The parameter 'age' will be given in weeks up to 16 weeks, and thereafter in months. You can assume that children presented will be scheduled for vaccination (eg '16 weeks', '12 months' etc).
- The parameter 'status' indicates if the child has missed a scheduled vaccination, and the argument will be a string that says 'up-to-date', or a scheduled stage (eg '8 weeks') that has been missed, in which case you need to add any missing shots to the list. Only one missed vaccination stage will be passed in per function call.
- If the month is 'september', 'october' or 'november' add 'offer fluVaccine' to the list.
- Make sure there are no duplicates in the returned list, and sort it alphabetically.

#### Example input and output
~~~~
input     ('12 weeks', 'up-to-date', 'december')
output    ['fiveInOne', 'rotavirus']

input     ('12 months', '16 weeks', 'june')

input     ('40 months', '12 months', 'october') 
output    ['hibMenC', 'measlesMumpsRubella', 'meningitisB', 'offer fluVaccine', 'preSchoolBooster']

Given a string, determine if it's a valid identifier.

## Here is the syntax for valid identifiers:
* Each identifier must have at least one character.
* The first character must be picked from: alpha, underscore, or dollar sign. The first character cannot be a digit.
* The rest of the characters (besides the first) can be from: alpha, digit, underscore, or dollar sign. In other words, it can be any valid identifier character.

### Examples of valid identifiers:
* i
* wo_rd
* b2h

### Examples of invalid identifiers:
* 1i
* wo rd 
* !b2h

# Task
John is an orchard worker. 

There are `n` piles of fruits waiting to be transported. Each pile of fruit has a corresponding weight. John's job is to combine the fruits into a pile and wait for the truck to take them away.

Every time, John can combine any two piles(`may be adjacent piles, or not`), and the energy he costs is equal to the weight of the two piles of fruit.

For example, if there are two piles, pile1's weight is `1` and pile2's weight is `2`. After merging, the new pile's weight is `3`, and he consumed 3 units of energy.

John wants to combine all the fruits into 1 pile with the least energy.

Your task is to help John, calculate the minimum energy he costs.

# Input

- `fruits`: An array of positive integers. Each element represents the weight of a pile of fruit.

  Javascript:
  - 1 <= fruits.length <= 10000
  - 1 <= fruits[i] <= 10000

  Python:
  - 1 <= len(fruits) <= 5000
  - 1 <= fruits[i] <= 10000

# Output

An integer. the minimum energy John costs.

# Examples

For `fruits = [1,2,9]`, the output should be `15`.

```
3 piles:  1  2  9
combine 1 and 2 to 3, cost 3 units of energy.
2 piles:  3  9
combine 3 and 9 to 12, cost 12 units of energy.
1 pile:  12

The total units of energy is 3 + 12 = 15 units
```

For `fruits = [100]`, the output should be `0`.

There's only 1 pile. So no need combine it.

# Story

John found a path to a treasure, and while searching for its precise location he wrote a list of directions using symbols `""^""`, `""v""`, `""<""`, `"">""` which mean `north`, `east`, `west`, and `east` accordingly. On his way John had to try many different paths, sometimes walking in circles, and even missing the treasure completely before finally noticing it.

___

## Task

Simplify the list of directions written by John by eliminating any loops.

**Note**: a loop is any sublist of directions which leads John to the coordinate he had already visited.

___

## Examples

```
simplify(""<>>"")        ==  "">""
simplify(""<^^>v<^^^"")  ==  ""<^^^^""
simplify("""")           ==  """"
simplify(""^< > v
    ^   v
> > C > D > >
^   ^   v
^ < B < <
    ^
    A
```

John visits points `A -> B -> C -> D -> B -> C -> D`, realizes that `-> C -> D -> B` steps are meaningless and removes them, getting this path: `A -> B -> (*removed*) -> C -> D`.

```
    ∙ ∙ ∙
    ∙   ∙
> > C > D > >
^   ∙   ∙
^ < B ∙ ∙
    ^
    A
```

Following the final, simplified route John visits points `C` and `D`, but for the first time, not the second (because we ignore the steps made on a hypothetical path), and he doesn't need to alter the directions list anymore.

## Number of people in the bus
There is a bus moving in the city, and it takes and drop some people in each bus stop.

You are provided with a list (or array) of integer arrays (or tuples). Each integer array has two items which represent number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.

Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D 

Take a look on the test cases.

Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the return integer can't be negative.

The second value in the first integer array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.

Compare two strings by comparing the sum of their values (ASCII character code).

* For comparing treat all letters as UpperCase
* `null/NULL/Nil/None` should be treated as empty strings
* If the string contains other characters than letters, treat the whole string as it would be empty

Your method should return `true`, if the strings are equal and `false` if they are not equal.

## Examples:
```
""AD"", ""BC""  -> equal
""AD"", ""DD""  -> not equal
""gf"", ""FG""  -> equal
""zz1"", """"   -> equal (both are considered empty)
""ZzZz"", ""ffPFF"" -> equal
""kl"", ""lz""  -> not equal

Pirates have notorious difficulty with enunciating. They tend to blur all the letters together and scream at people.

At long last, we need a way to unscramble what these pirates are saying.

Write a function that will accept a jumble of letters as well as a dictionary, and output a list of words that the pirate might have meant.

For example:
```
grabscrab( ""ortsp"", [""sport"", ""parrot"", ""ports"", ""matey""] )
```

Should return `[""sport"", ""ports""]`.

Return matches in the same order as in the dictionary. Return an empty array if there are no matches.

Good luck!

In Spanish, the conjugated verb changes by adding suffixes and according to the person we're talking about. There's something similar in English when we talk about ""She"", ""He""or ""It"" (3rd person singular):

With the verb ""run"":

**He / She / It runS**

As you can see, the rule (at least with regular verbs) is to add the suffix  ""-s"" in the 3rd person singular. In Spanish it works the same way but we need to remove the **infinitive suffix** and add a specific suffix to all the others persons (I, You, He/She/It, We, You, They).

Verbs in Spanish and the infinitive suffix.
--

In Spanish we assume a verb is on its infitive form when it has one of the infinitives suffixes (**AR**, **ER** or **IR**) at the end:

- Com**er** -> to eat

- Camin**ar** -> to walk

- Viv**ir** -> to live

## How to conjugate

For conjugating in Spanish, we need to remove the infinitive suffix (**ar**, **er** *or* **ir**) and add the personal suffixes corresponding to the person we're talking to. In this kata we'll conjugate the verbs to its **presente indicativo** (simple present) form.

Personal suffixes
--
The personal suffixes changes depending of the **Infinitive suffix**.

If the infinitive suffix is **AR** the personal suffixes are:

- first person singular (Yo / I): -**o**
- second person singular (Tú / You): -**as**
- third person singular (Él, Ella / He, She): -**a**
- first person plural (Nosotros / We): -**amos**
- second person plural (Vosotros / You): -**áis**
- third person plural (Ellos / They): -**an**

If the infinitive suffix is **ER**:
- first person singular (Yo / I): -**o**
- second person singular (Tú / You): -**es**
- third person singular (Él, Ella / He, She): -**e**
- first person plural (Nosotros / We): -**emos**
- second person plural (Vosotros / You): -**éis**
- third person plural (Ellos / They): -**en**

If the infinitive suffix is **IR**:
- first person singular (Yo / I): -**o**
- second person singular (Tú / You): -**es**
- third person singular (Él, Ella / He, She): -**e**
- first person plural (Nosotros / We): -**imos**
- second person plural (Vosotros / You): -**ís**
- third person plural (Ellos / They): -**en**

## Conjugating 
Steps for conjugating:
1. Remove the infinitive suffix (ar, er, ir)
2. And add the personal suffixes
- Example: verb **Caminar** (to walk)
  - Camin**o** (I walk)
  - Camin**as** (You walk)
  - Camin**a** (He walks)
  - Camin**amos** (We walk)
  - Camin**áis** (You guys walk)
  - Camin**an** (They walk)
- Example: verb **Comer** (to eat):
  - Com**o** (I eat)
  - Com**es** (You eat)
  - Com**e** (He, She eats)
  - Com**emos** (We eat)
  - Com**éis** (You guys eat)
  - Com**en** (They eat)
- Example: verb **Vivir** (to live):
  - Viv**o** (I live)
  - Viv**es** (You live)
  - Viv**e** (He, She lives)
  - Viv**imos** (We live)
  - Viv**ís** (You guys live)
  - Viv**en** (They live)

## Your Task

You need to write a function called **conjugate** which will return an object with a spanish verb conjugated. The object must look like this:

```
{
  ""comer"": [
    ""como"",
    ""comes"",
    ""come"",
    ""comemos"",
    ""coméis"",
    ""comen""
  ]
}

```

Where the key is the verb in its original form (infinitive form) and its value will be an array with the conjugations.

Another example:
```
{
  ""vivir"": [
    ""vivo"",
    ""vives"",
    ""vive"",
    ""vivimos"",
    ""vivís"",
    ""viven""
  ]
}

```

## Notes:
1. The conjugations must be in this order:
```
{
    verb: [
      ""first person singular"",
      ""second person singular"",
      ""third person singular"",
      ""first person plural"",
      ""second person plural"",
      ""third person plural""
    ]
}
```
2.Don't use `JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)` because the ""presentation"" of the object isn't important.

3.Don't use accents in Python version

 **Buena suerte!**

Implement `String#parse_mana_cost`, which parses [Magic: the Gathering mana costs](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Mana_cost) expressed as a string and returns a `Hash` with keys being kinds of mana, and values being the numbers.

Don't include any mana types equal to zero.

Format is:

* optionally natural number representing total amount of generic mana (use key `*`)
* optionally followed by any combination of `w`, `u`, `b`, `r`, `g` (case insensitive in input, return lower case in output), each representing one mana of specific color.

If case of Strings not following specified format, return `nil/null/None`.

There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!

### input
```if-not:c
* customers: an array of positive integers representing the queue. Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.
* n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.
```
```if:c
* customers: a pointer to an array of positive integers representing the queue. Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.
* customers_length: the length of the array that `customers` points to.
* n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.
```

### output
The function should return an integer, the total time required.

-------------------------------------------

## Important
**Please look at the examples and clarifications below, to ensure you understand the task correctly :)**

-------

### Examples

```python
queue_time([5,3,4], 1)
# should return 12
# because when n=1, the total time is just the sum of the times

queue_time([10,2,3,3], 2)
# should return 10
# because here n=2 and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th people in the 
# queue finish before the 1st person has finished.

queue_time([2,3,10], 2)
# should return 12
```

### Clarifications

 * There is only ONE queue serving many tills, and
 * The order of the queue NEVER changes, and
 * The front person in the queue (i.e. the first element in the array/list) proceeds to a till as soon as it becomes free.

N.B. You should assume that all the test input will be valid, as specified above.

P.S. The situation in this kata can be likened to the more-computer-science-related idea of a thread pool, with relation to running multiple processes at the same time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool

You will have a list of rationals in the form

```
lst = [ [numer_1, denom_1] , ... , [numer_n, denom_n] ]
```
or
```
lst = [ (numer_1, denom_1) , ... , (numer_n, denom_n) ]
```

where all numbers are positive integers. You have to produce their sum `N / D` in an irreducible form: this means that `N` and `D` have only `1` as a common divisor.

Return the result in the form:

- `[N, D]` in Ruby, Crystal, Python, Clojure, JS, CS, PHP, Julia
- `Just ""N D""` in Haskell, PureScript
- `""[N, D]""` in Java, CSharp, TS, Scala, PowerShell, Kotlin
- `""N/D""` in Go, Nim
- `{N, D}` in C++, Elixir
- `{N, D}` in C
- `Some((N, D))` in Rust
- `Some ""N D""` in F#, Ocaml
- `c(N, D)` in R
- `(N, D)` in Swift
- `'(N D)` in Racket

If the result is an integer (`D` evenly divides `N`) return:

- an integer in Ruby, Crystal, Elixir, Clojure, Python, JS, CS, PHP, R, Julia
- `Just ""n""` (Haskell, PureScript)
- `""n""` Java, CSharp, TS, Scala, PowerShell, Go, Nim, Kotlin
- `{n, 1}` in C++
- `{n, 1}` in C
- `Some((n, 1))` in Rust
- `Some ""n""` in F#, Ocaml,
- `(n, 1)` in Swift
- `n` in Racket 

If the input list is empty, return 

- `nil/None/null/Nothing` 
- `{0, 1}` in C++
- `{0, 1}` in C
- `""0""` in Scala, PowerShell, Go, Nim
- `O` in Racket
- `""""` in Kotlin

### Example:

```
[ [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4] ]  -->  [13, 12]

    1/2  +  1/3  +  1/4     =      13/12

# Task
 Four men, `a, b, c and d` are standing in a line, one behind another. 

 There's a wall between the first three people (a, b and c) and the last one (d).

 a, b and c are lined up in order of height, so that person a can see the backs of b and c, person b can see the back of c, and c can see just the wall.

 There are 4 hats, 2 black and 2 white. Each person is given a hat. None of them can see their own hat, but person a can see the hats of b and c, while person b can see the hat of person c. Neither c nor d can see any hats.

 Once a person figures out their hat's color, they shouts it. 

 ![](http://stuffbox.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Guess-hat-colour-604x270.png)

 Your task is to return the person who will guess their hat first. You can assume that they will speak only when they reach a correct conclusion.

# Input/Output

It's been a tough week at work and you are stuggling to get out of bed in the morning.

While waiting at the bus stop you realise that if you could time your arrival to the nearest minute you could get valuable extra minutes in bed.

There is a bus that goes to your office every 15 minute, the first bus is at `06:00`, and the last bus is at `00:00`.

Given that it takes 5 minutes to walk from your front door to the bus stop, implement a function that when given the curent time will tell you much time is left, before you must leave to catch the next bus.

## Examples

```
""05:00""  =>  55
""10:00""  =>  10
""12:10""  =>  0
""12:11""  =>  14
```

### Notes

1. Return the number of minutes till the next bus
2. Input will be formatted as `HH:MM` (24-hour clock)
3. The input time might be after the buses have stopped running, i.e. after `00:00`

Given a list of elements [a1, a2, ..., an], with each ai being a string, write a function **majority** that returns the value that appears the most in the list. 

If there's no winner, the function should return None, NULL, nil, etc, based on the programming language.

Example
majority([""A"", ""B"", ""A""]) returns ""A""
majority([""A"", ""B"", ""B"", ""A""]) returns None

You are to write a function to transpose a guitar tab up or down a number of semitones. The amount to transpose is a number, positive or negative. The tab is given as an array, with six elements for each guitar string (fittingly passed as strings). Output your tab in a similar form.

Guitar tablature (or 'tab') is an alternative to sheet music, where notes are replaced by fret numbers and the five lines of the staff are replaced by six lines to represent each of the guitar's strings. It is still read from left to right like sheet music, and notes written directly above each other are played at the same time.

For example, Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven begins:
```
e|-------5-7-----7-|-8-----8-2-----2-|-0---------0-----|-----------------|
B|-----5-----5-----|---5-------3-----|---1---1-----1---|-0-1-1-----------|
G|---5---------5---|-----5-------2---|-----2---------2-|-0-2-2-----------|
D|-7-------6-------|-5-------4-------|-3---------------|-----------------|
A|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-2-0-0---0--/8-7-|
E|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
```
Transposed up two semitones, it would look like this:
```
e|-------7-9-----9-|-10-----10-4-----4-|-2---------2-----|------------------|
B|-----7-----7-----|----7--------5-----|---3---3-----3---|-2-3-3------------|
G|---7---------7---|------7--------4---|-----4---------4-|-2-4-4------------|
D|-9-------8-------|-7---------6-------|-5---------------|------------------|
A|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-4-2-2---2--/10-9-|
E|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
```
Note how when the 8th fret note on the top string in bar 2 gets transposed to the 10th fret, extra '-' are added on the other strings below so as to retain the single '-' that originally separated that beat (i.e. column) from the following note – fret 7 on the B string.

Each beat must retain at least one '-' separator before the next, to keep the tab legible. The inputted test tabs all obey this convention.

Electric guitars usually have 22 frets, with the 0th fret being an open string. If your fret numbers transpose to either negative values or values over 22, you should return 'Out of frets!' (and probably detune your guitar).

Tests include some randomly generated guitar tabs, which come with no guarantee of musical quality and/or playability...!

In this Kata, you will be given a series of times at which an alarm goes off. Your task will be to determine the maximum time interval between alarms. Each alarm starts ringing at the beginning of the corresponding minute and rings for exactly one minute. The times in the array are not in chronological order. Ignore duplicate times, if any.

```Haskell
For example:
solve([""14:51""]) = ""23:59"". If the alarm goes off now, it will not go off for another 23 hours and 59 minutes.
solve([""23:00"",""04:22"",""18:05"",""06:24""]) == ""11:40"". The max interval that the alarm will not go off is 11 hours and 40 minutes.
```
In the second example, the alarm goes off `4` times in a day.

More examples in test cases. Good luck!

You are the best freelancer in the city. Everybody knows you, but what they don't know, is that you are actually offloading your work to other freelancers and and you rarely need to do any work. You're living the life!

To make this process easier you need to write a method called workNeeded to figure out how much time you need to contribute to a project. 

Giving the amount of time in `minutes` needed to complete the project and an array of pair values representing other freelancers' time in `[Hours, Minutes]` format ie. `[[2, 33], [3, 44]]` calculate how much time **you** will need to contribute to the project (if at all) and return a string depending on the case.

* If we need to contribute time to the project then return `""I need to work x hour(s) and y minute(s)""`
* If we don't have to contribute any time to the project then return `""Easy Money!""`

Given a string, turn each letter into its ASCII character code and join them together to create a number - let's call this number `total1`:

```
'ABC' --> 'A' = 65, 'B' = 66, 'C' = 67 --> 656667
```

Then replace any incidence of the number `7` with the number `1`, and call this number 'total2':
```
total1 = 656667
              ^
total2 = 656661
              ^
```

Then return the difference between the sum of the digits in `total1` and `total2`:

## TL;DR

Given a number of vertices `N` and a list of weighted directed edges in a directed acyclic graph (each edge is written as `[start, end, weight]` where `from < to`), compute the weight of the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `N - 1`.  If there is no such path, return `-1`.

## Background

A weighted DAG is a directed acyclic graph where each edge has a weight associated with it:

1
5
3
1
5

A
B
C
D

In this example, the shortest path from A to D is given by A -> B -> D, which has a total weight of 4.

Finding shortest distances in DAGs is made easier by the fact that the nodes can be _linearized:_ they can be given an order `A1, A2, ..., An` such that edges only point forward (that is, there are no edges from `Aj` to `Ai` when `j > i`).  In the example above, the two possible linear orderings are `A, B, C, D` and `A, C, B, D.`

1

1
5
5
3

A
B
C
D

## Your Task

Given a number `N` (indicating a graph with vertices `0, 1, ..., N-1`) and a list of weighted edges `[start, end, weight]` for a DAG, where `start < end` for each edge, find the weight (a.k.a. length) of the shortest path from node `0` to node `N-1`.

For example, if the input is

```
N = 4
edgeList = [
  [0, 1, 1], [0, 2, 5], [0, 3, 5], [1, 3, 3], [2, 3, 1]
]
```

then we have the graph depicted above (with `0 = A`, `1 = B`, etc.) and the answer is `4`.

If there is no path from node `0` to node `N-1`, return `-1`.

## Notes and Warnings

**Precondition:** `N` will always be greater than 1, and edge weights will always be positive integers.  There may be multiple edges going between two nodes.

**Warning:** You will probably need to use a dynamic programming solution if you want your solution to run fast enough not to time out--that's the whole point of this kata!

However, a well-written general shortest-path algorithm such as Dijkstra's Algorithm may also be fast enough to past the soak tests.  (The reason is that the dividing line between linear and linearithmic time is hard to define and depends on a variety of external factors, so the kata's tests err on the safe side.)

Your task is to determine the top 3 place finishes in a pole vault competition involving several different competitors. This is isn't always so simple, and it is often a source of confusion for people who don't know the actual rules.

Here's what you need to know:

As input, you will receive an array of objects. Each object contains the respective competitor's name (as a string) and his/her results at the various bar heights (as an array of strings):

[{name: ""Sergey"", results: ["""", ""O"", ""XO"", ""O"", ""XXO"", ""XXX"", """", """"]}{name: ""Jan"", results: ["""", """", """", ""O"", ""O"", ""XO"", ""XXO"", ""XXX""]}{name: ""Bruce"", results: ["""", ""XO"", ""XXO"", ""XXX"", """", """", """", """"]}{name: ""HerrWert"", results: [""XXX"", """", """", """", """", """", """", """"]}]

In the array of strings described above, each string represents the vaulter's performance at a given height. The possible values are based on commonly used written notations on a pole vault scoresheet:
An empty string indicates that the vaulter did not jump at this height for a variety of possible reasons (""passed"" at this height, was temporarily called away to a different track and field event, was already eliminated from competition, or withdrew due to injury, for example).An upper-case X in the string represents an unsuccessful attempt at the height. (As you may know, the vaulter is eliminated from the competition after three consecutive failed attempts.)An upper-case O represents a successful attempt. If present at all, this will be the final character in the string, because it indicates that the vaulter has now successfully completed this height and is ready to move on.

All vaulters will have a result string (though possibly empty) for every height involved in the competition, making it possible to match up the results of different vaulters with less confusion.

Obviously, your first task is to determine who cleared the greatest height successfully. In other words, who has a ""O"" mark at a higher array element than any other competitor? You might want to work through the arrays from right to left to determine this. In the most straightforward case, you would first determine the winner, then second place, and finally third place by this simple logic.

But what if there's a tie for one of these finishing places? Proceed as follows (according to American high school rules, at least):
First trace backwards to find the greatest height that both vaulters cleared successfully. Then determine who had the fewest unsuccessful attempts at this height (i.e., the fewest X's in the string for this height). This person wins the tie-break.But what if they're still tied with one another?  Do NOT continue to trace backwards through the heights! Instead, compare their total numbers of unsuccessful attempts at all heights in the competition. The vaulter with the fewest total misses wins the tie-break.But what if they're still tied? It depends on the finishing place:If it's for second or third place, the tie stands (i.e., is not broken).But if it's for first place, there must be a jump-off (like overtime or penalty kicks in other sports) to break the tie and determine the winner. (This jump-off occurs - hypothetically - after your code runs and is thus not a part of this kata.)

Return a single object as your result. Each place-finish that is included in the results (including at least first place as property ""1st"" and possibly second and third places as properties ""2nd"" and ""3rd"") should have as its value the respective vaulter's name. In the event of a tie, the value of the property is the names of all tied vaulters, in alphabetical order, separated by commas, and followed by the notation ""(jump-off)"" if the tie is for first place or ""(tie)"" if it's for second or third place.

Here are some possible outcomes to show you what I mean:
{1st: ""Jan"", 2nd: ""Sergey""; 3rd: ""Bruce""} (These results correspond to the sample input data given above.){1st: ""Julia"", 2nd: ""Madi, Emily (tie)}""{1st: ""Caleb, Dustin (jump-off)"", 3rd: ""Sam""}{1st: ""Meredith"", 2nd: ""Maddy"", 3rd: ""Cierra, Sara (tie)""}{1st: ""Alex, Basti, Max (jump-off)""}

If you are familiar with the awarding of place finishes in sporting events or team standings in a league, then you know that there won't necessarily be a 2nd or 3rd place, because ties in higher places ""bump""  all lower places downward accordingly.

One more thing: You really shouldn't change the array of objects that you receive as input. This represents the physical scoresheet. We need this ""original document"" to be intact, so that we can refer back to it to resolve a disputed result!

Have fun with this!

Notes for the Python version:

The rules for the Python version are the same as the original JavaScript version. 

The input and output will look the same as the JavaScript version. But, the JavaScript objects will be replaced by Python dictionaries. The JavaScript arrays will be replaced by Python lists. The Python function name was changed to include underscores as is customary with Python names. The example below should help clarify all of this.

The input for the Python version will be a list containing dictionaries with the competitors' names and results. The names in the dictionaries are strings. The results are lists with a list of strings. And example follows.

score_pole_vault([
        {""name"": ""Linda"", ""results"": [""XXO"", ""O"",""XXO"", ""O""]},
        {""name"": ""Vickie"", ""results"": [""O"",""X"", """", """"]},
        {""name"": ""Debbie"", ""results"": [""XXO"", ""O"",""XO"", ""XXX""]},
        {""name"": ""Michelle"", ""results"": [""XO"",""XO"",""XXX"",""""]},
        {""name"": ""Carol"", ""results"": [""XXX"", """","""",""""]}
])

The returned results should be in a dictionary with one to three elements. 

Examples of possible returned results:

  {'1st': 'Linda', '2nd': 'Debbie', '3rd': 'Michelle'}

  {'1st': 'Green, Hayes (jump-off)', '3rd': 'Garcia'}           
  Note: Since first place was tied in this case, there is no 2nd place awarded.

  {'1st': 'Wilson', '2nd': 'Laurie', '3rd': 'Joyce, Moore (tie)'}

I have tried to create test cases that have every concievable tie situation.

Have fun with this version, as well!

###Introduction

The [I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) (Yijing, or Book of Changes) is an ancient Chinese book of sixty-four hexagrams. 
A hexagram is a figure composed of six stacked horizontal lines, where each line is either Yang (an unbroken line) or Yin (a broken line):
```
---------    ---- ----    ---------    
---- ----    ---- ----    ---------    
---- ----    ---- ----    ---------    
---------    ---- ----    ---- ----    
---------    ---------    ---- ----    
---- ----    ---- ----    ---------    
```
The book is commonly used as an oracle. After asking it a question about one's present scenario,
each line is determined by random methods to be Yang or Yin. The resulting hexagram is then interpreted by the querent as a symbol of their current situation, and how it might unfold.

This kata will consult the I Ching using the three coin method.

###Instructions

A coin is flipped three times and lands heads
or tails. The three results are used to
determine a line as being either:
```
3 tails          ----x----  Yin (Moving Line*)
2 tails 1 heads  ---------  Yang
1 tails 2 heads  ---- ----  Yin 
3 heads          ----o----  Yang (Moving Line*)

*See bottom of description if curious.
```
This process is repeated six times to determine
each line of the hexagram. The results of these
operations are then stored in a 2D Array like so:
In each array the first index will always be the number of the line ('one' is the bottom line, and 'six' the top), and the other three values will be the results of the coin flips that belong to that line as heads ('h') and tails ('t').

Write a function that will take a 2D Array like the above as argument and return its hexagram as a string. Each line of the hexagram should begin on a new line.

should return:
```
---------
---------
----x----
----o----
---- ----
---- ----
```
You are welcome to consult your new oracle program with a question before pressing submit. You can compare your result [here](http://www.ichingfortune.com/hexagrams.php). The last test case is random and can be used for your query.

*[1] A Moving Line is a Yang line that will change
to Yin or vice versa. The hexagram made by the coin
throws represents the querent's current situation,
and the hexagram that results from changing its
moving lines represents their upcoming situation.*

There is an array of strings. All strings contains similar _letters_ except one. Try to find it!

```python
find_uniq([ 'Aa', 'aaa', 'aaaaa', 'BbBb', 'Aaaa', 'AaAaAa', 'a' ]) # => 'BbBb'
find_uniq([ 'abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'foo', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba' ]) # => 'foo'
```

Strings may contain spaces. Spaces is not significant, only non-spaces symbols matters. E.g. string that contains only spaces is like empty string.

It’s guaranteed that array contains more than 3 strings.

This is the second kata in series:

1. [Find the unique number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/585d7d5adb20cf33cb000235)

When working with color values it can sometimes be useful to extract the individual red, green, and blue (RGB) component values for a color. Implement a function that meets these requirements:

+ Accepts a case-insensitive hexadecimal color string as its parameter (ex. `""#FF9933""` or `""#ff9933""`)
+ Returns an object with the structure `{r: 255, g: 153, b: 51}` where *r*, *g*, and *b* range from 0 through 255

**Note:** your implementation does not need to support the shorthand form of hexadecimal notation (ie `""#FFF""`)

## Example

```
""#FF9933"" --> {r: 255, g: 153, b: 51}
```

Write a function that accepts two square (`NxN`) matrices (two dimensional arrays), and returns the product of the two. Only square matrices will be given.

How to multiply two square matrices: 

We are given two matrices, A and B, of size 2x2 (note: tests are not limited to 2x2). Matrix C, the solution, will be equal to the product of A and B. To fill in cell `[0][0]` of matrix C, you need to compute: `A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0]`.

More general: To fill in cell `[n][m]` of matrix C, you need to first multiply the elements in the nth row of matrix A by the elements in the mth column of matrix B, then take the sum of all those products. This will give you the value for cell `[m][n]` in matrix C. 

## Example
```
  A         B          C
|1 2|  x  |3 2|  =  | 5 4|
|3 2|     |1 1|     |11 8|
```

Detailed calculation:
```
C[0][0] = A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0] = 1*3 + 2*1 =  5
C[0][1] = A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1] = 1*2 + 2*1 =  4
C[1][0] = A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0] = 3*3 + 2*1 = 11
C[1][1] = A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1] = 3*2 + 2*1 =  8
```

**Note:** In **C**, the dimensions of both square matrices `n` will be passed into your function.  However, since the dimensions of your returned ""matrix"" is expected to be the same as that of the inputs, you will not need to keep track of the dimensions of your matrix in another variable.

Write a function that accepts two square matrices (`N x N` two dimensional arrays), and return the sum of the two. Both matrices being passed into the function will be of size `N x N` (square), containing only integers.

How to sum two matrices:

Take each cell `[n][m]` from the first matrix, and add it with the same `[n][m]` cell from the second matrix. This will be cell `[n][m]` of the solution matrix.

## Check Digits

Some numbers are more important to get right during data entry than others: a common example is product codes.

To reduce the possibility of mistakes, product codes can be crafted in such a way that simple errors are detected. This is done by calculating a single-digit value based on the product number, and then appending that digit to the product number to arrive at the product code.

When the product code is checked, the check digit value is stripped off and recalculated. If the supplied value does not match the recalculated value, the product code is rejected.

A simple scheme for generating self-check digits, described here, is called Modulus 11 Self-Check.

## Calculation method

Each digit in the product number is assigned a multiplication factor. The factors are assigned ***from right to left***, starting at `2` and counting up. For numbers longer than six digits, the factors restart at `2` after `7` is reached. The product of each digit and its factor is calculated, and the products summed. For example:

```python
digit     :  1    6    7    7    0    3    6    2    5
factor    :  4    3    2    7    6    5    4    3    2
           ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---
             4 + 18 + 14 + 49 +  0 + 15 + 24 +  6 + 10 = 140
```

Then the sum of the products is divided by the prime number `11`. The remainder is inspected, and:

* if the remainder is `0`, the check digit is also `0`
* if the remainder is `1`, the check digit is replaced by an uppercase `X`
* for all others, the remainder is subtracted from `11`

The result is the **check digit**.

## Your task

Your task is to implement this algorithm and return the input number with the correct check digit appended.

## Examples

```python
input: ""036532""

product sum = 2*2 + 3*3 + 5*4 + 6*5 + 3*6 + 0*7 = 81
remainder   = 81 mod 11 = 4
check digit = 11 - 4 = 7

output: ""0365327""

In this Kata, you will be given an array of numbers and a number `n`, and your task will be to determine if `any` array elements, when summed (or taken individually), are divisible by `n`. 

For example:

  * `solve([1,3,4,7,6],9) == true`, because `3 + 6` is divisible by `9`
  * `solve([1,2,3,4,5],10) == true` for similar reasons.
  * `solve([8,5,3,9],7) == true`, because `7` evenly divides `5 + 9`
  * but `solve([8,5,3],7) == false`.

All numbers in the array will be greater than `0`. 

More examples in the test cases.

Good luck!

# A wolf in sheep's clothing

Wolves have been reintroduced to Great Britain. You are a sheep farmer, and are now plagued by wolves which pretend to be sheep. Fortunately, you are good at spotting them. 

Warn the sheep in front of the wolf that it is about to be eaten. Remember that you are standing **at the front of the queue** which is at the end of the array:

```
[sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, wolf, sheep, sheep]      (YOU ARE HERE AT THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE)
   7      6      5      4      3            2      1
```

If the wolf is the closest animal to you, return `""Pls go away and stop eating my sheep""`. Otherwise, return `""Oi! Sheep number N! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!""` where `N` is the sheep's position in the queue.

**Note:** there will always be exactly one wolf in the array.

## Examples

```python
warn_the_sheep([""sheep"", ""sheep"", ""sheep"", ""wolf"", ""sheep""]) == 'Oi! Sheep number 1! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!'

warn_the_sheep(['sheep', 'sheep', 'wolf']) == 'Pls go away and stop eating my sheep'

If you finish this kata, you can try [Insane Coloured Triangles](http://www.codewars.com/kata/insane-coloured-triangles) by Bubbler, which is a ***much*** harder version of this one.

A coloured triangle is created from a row of colours, each of which is red, green or blue. Successive rows, each containing one fewer colour than the last, are generated by considering the two touching colours in the previous row. If these colours are identical, the same colour is used in the new row. If they are different, the missing colour is used in the new row. This is continued until the final row, with only a single colour, is generated.

The different possibilities are:
```
Colour here:        G G        B G        R G        B R
Becomes colour:      G          R          B          G
```

With a bigger example:
```
R R G B R G B B
 R B R G B R B
  G G B R G G
   G R G B G
    B B R R
     B G R
      R B
       G
```

You will be given the first row of the triangle as a string and its your job to return the final colour which would appear in the bottom row as a string. In the case of the example above, you would the given `RRGBRGBB` you should return `G`.

* The input string will only contain the uppercase letters `R, G, B` and there will be at least one letter so you do not have to test for invalid input.
* If you are only given one colour as the input, return that colour. 

*Adapted from the 2017 British Informatics Olympiad*

Define a method that accepts 2 strings as parameters. The method returns the first string sorted by the second.

```python
sort_string(""foos"", ""of"")       == ""oofs""
sort_string(""string"", ""gnirts"") == ""gnirts""
sort_string(""banana"", ""abn"")    == ""aaabnn""
```

To elaborate, the second string defines the ordering. It is possible that in the second string characters repeat, so you should remove repeating characters, leaving only the first occurrence.

Any character in the first string that does not appear in the second string should be sorted to the end of the result in original order.

Don't Drink the Water

Given a two-dimensional array representation of a glass of mixed liquids, sort the array such that the liquids appear in the glass based on their density. (Lower density floats to the top) The width of the glass will not change from top to bottom.

On Unix system type files can be identified with the ls -l command which displays the type of the file in the first alphabetic letter of the file system permissions field. You can find more information about file type on Unix system on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types).

- '-' A regular file ==> `file`.
- 'd' A directory ==> `directory`.
- 'l' A symbolic link ==> `symlink`.
- 'c' A character special file. It refers to a device that handles data as a stream of bytes (e.g: a terminal/modem) ==> `character_file`.
- 'b' A block special file. It refers to a device that handles data in blocks (e.g: such as a hard drive or CD-ROM drive) ==> `block_file`.
- 'p' a named pipe ==> `pipe`.
- 's' a socket ==> `socket`.
- 'D' a door ==> `door`.

In this kata you should complete a function that return the `filetype` as a string regarding the `file_attribute` given by the `ls -l` command. 

For example if the function receive `-rwxr-xr-x` it should return `file`.

Check your arrows
You have a quiver of arrows, but some have been damaged. The quiver contains arrows with an optional range information (different types of targets are positioned at different ranges), so each item is an arrow.

You need to verify that you have some good ones left, in order to prepare for battle:
```python
anyArrows([{'range': 5}, {'range': 10, 'damaged': True}, {'damaged': True}])
```

If an arrow in the quiver does not have a damaged status, it means it's new.

The expected result is a boolean, indicating whether you have any good arrows left.

Bit Vectors/Bitmaps
A bitmap is one way of efficiently representing sets of unique integers using single bits.
To see how this works, we can represent a set of unique integers between `0` and `< 20` using a vector/array of 20 bits:
```
var set = [3, 14, 2, 11, 16, 4, 6];```
```
var bitmap = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0];
```
As you can see, with a bitmap, the length of the vector represents the range of unique values in the set (in this case `0-20`), and the `0/1` represents whether or not the current index is equal to a value in the set.

Task:
Your task is to write a function `toBits` that will take in a set of uniqe integers and output a bit vector/bitmap (an array in javascript) using `1`s and `0`s to represent present and non-present values.
Input:
The function will be passed a set of unique integers in string form, in a random order, separated by line breaks.
Each integer can be expected to have a unique value `>= 0` and `< 5000`.
The input will look like this:
`let exampleInput = '3\n14\n5\n19\n18\n1\n8\n11\n2...'`
Output:
The function will be expected to output a 5000 bit vector (array) of bits, either `0` or `1`, for example:
`let exampleOutput = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,...]`

Some new cashiers started to work at your restaurant. 

They are good at taking orders, but they don't know how to capitalize words, or use a space bar! 

All the orders they create look something like this:

`""milkshakepizzachickenfriescokeburgerpizzasandwichmilkshakepizza""`

The kitchen staff are threatening to quit, because of how difficult it is to read the orders. 

Their preference is to get the orders as a nice clean string with spaces and capitals like so:

`""Burger Fries Chicken Pizza Pizza Pizza Sandwich Milkshake Milkshake Coke""`

The kitchen staff expect the items to be in the same order as they appear in the menu. 

The menu items are fairly simple, there is no overlap in the names of the items:

Implement a function that normalizes out of range sequence indexes (converts them to 'in range' indexes) by making them repeatedly 'loop' around the array. The function should then return the value at that index. Indexes that are not out of range should be handled normally and indexes to empty sequences should return undefined/None depending on the language.

For positive numbers that are out of range, they loop around starting at the beginning, so 

```python
norm_index_test(seq, len(seq))     # Returns first element
norm_index_test(seq, len(seq) + 1) # Returns second element
norm_index_test(seq, len(seq) + 2) # Returns third element
# And so on...
norm_index_test(seq, len(seq) * 2) # Returns first element

For every good kata idea there seem to be quite a few bad ones!

In this kata you need to check the provided 2 dimensional array (x) for good ideas 'good' and bad ideas 'bad'. If there are one or two good ideas, return 'Publish!', if there are more than 2 return 'I smell a series!'. If there are no good ideas, as is often the case, return 'Fail!'.

The sub arrays may not be the same length.

The solution should be case insensitive (ie good, GOOD and gOOd all count as a good idea). All inputs may not be strings.

A lot of goods have an  International Article Number (formerly known as ""European Article Number"") abbreviated ""EAN"". EAN is a 13-digits barcode consisting of 12-digits data followed by a single-digit checksum (EAN-8 is not considered in this kata).

The single-digit checksum is calculated as followed (based upon the 12-digit data):

The digit at the first, third, fifth, etc. position (i.e. at the odd position) has to be multiplied with ""1"". 
The digit at the second, fourth, sixth, etc. position (i.e. at the even position) has to be multiplied with ""3"".
Sum these results. 

If this sum is dividable by 10, the checksum is 0. Otherwise the checksum has the following formula:

  checksum = 10 - (sum mod 10)

For example, calculate the checksum for ""400330101839"" (= 12-digits data):

4·1 + 0·3 + 0·1 + 3·3 + 3·1 + 0·3 + 1·1 + 0·3 + 1·1 + 8·3 + 3·1 + 9·3
= 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 24 + 3 + 27 
= 72
10 - (72 mod 10) = 8 ⇒ Checksum: 8

Thus, the EAN-Code is 4003301018398 (= 12-digits data followed by single-digit checksum).

Your Task
Validate a given EAN-Code. Return true if the given EAN-Code is valid, otherwise false.

Assumption
You can assume the given code is syntactically valid, i.e. it only consists of numbers and it exactly has a length of 13 characters.

Examples

```python
validate_ean(""4003301018398"") # => True
validate_ean(""4003301018392"") # => False
```

Good Luck and have fun.

In this Kata, you're to complete the function `sum_square_even_root_odd`.

You will be given a list of numbers, `nums`, as the only argument to the function. Take each number in the list and *square* it if it is even, or *square root* the number if it is odd. Take this new list and find the *sum*, rounding to two decimal places.

The list will never be empty and will only contain values that are greater than or equal to zero.

Good luck!

### Task
 King Arthur and his knights are having a New Years party. Last year Lancelot was jealous of Arthur, because Arthur had a date and Lancelot did not, and they started a duel.

 To prevent this from happening again, Arthur wants to make sure that there are at least as many women as men at this year's party. He gave you a list of integers of all the party goers. 

 Arthur needs you to return true if he needs to invite more women or false if he is all set.

### Input/Output

 - `[input]` integer array `L` (`$a` in PHP)

  An array (guaranteed non-associative in PHP) representing the genders of the attendees, where `-1` represents `women` and `1` represents `men`.

  `2 <= L.length <= 50`

- `[output]` a boolean value

  `true` if Arthur need to invite more women, `false` otherwise.

In this kata, your task is to identify the pattern underlying a sequence of numbers. For example, if the sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then the pattern is [1], since each number in the sequence is equal to the number preceding it, plus 1. See the test cases for more examples.

A few more rules :

pattern may contain negative numbers.
sequence will always be made of a whole number of repetitions of the pattern.
Your answer must correspond to the shortest form of the pattern, e.g. if the pattern is [1], then [1, 1, 1, 1] will not be considered a correct answer.

An array is called `zero-balanced` if its elements sum to `0` and for each positive element `n`, there exists another element that is the negative of `n`. Write a function named `ìsZeroBalanced` that returns `true` if its argument is `zero-balanced` array, else return `false`. Note that an `empty array` will not sum to `zero`.

A core idea of several left-wing ideologies is that the wealthiest should *support* the poorest, no matter what and that is exactly what you are called to do using this kata (which, on a side note, was born out of the necessity to redistribute the width of `div`s into a given container).

You will be given two parameters, `population` and `minimum`: your goal is to give to each one according to his own needs (which we assume to be equal to `minimum` for everyone, no matter what), taking from the richest (bigger numbers) first.

For example, assuming a population `[2,3,5,15,75]` and `5` as a minimum, the expected result should be `[5,5,5,15,70]`. Let's punish those filthy capitalists, as we all know that being rich has to be somehow a fault and a shame!

If you happen to have few people as the richest, just take from the ones with the lowest index (the closest to the left, in few words) in the array first, on a 1:1 based heroic proletarian redistribution, until everyone is satisfied.

To clarify this rule, assuming a population `[2,3,5,45,45]` and `5` as `minimum`, the expected result should be `[5,5,5,42,43]`.

If you want to see it in steps, consider removing `minimum` from every member of the population, then iteratively (or recursively) adding 1 to the poorest while removing 1 from the richest. Pick the element most at left if more elements exist with the same level of minimal poverty, as they are certainly even more aligned with the party will than other poor people; similarly, it is ok to take from the richest one on the left first, so they can learn their lesson and be more kind, possibly giving more *gifts* to the inspectors of the State!

In steps:
```
[ 2, 3, 5,45,45] becomes
[-3,-2, 0,40,40] that then becomes
[-2,-2, 0,39,40] that then becomes
[-1,-2, 0,39,39] that then becomes
[-1,-1, 0,38,39] that then becomes
[ 0,-1, 0,38,38] that then becomes
[ 0, 0, 0,37,38] that then finally becomes (adding the minimum again, as no value is no longer under the poverty threshold
[ 5, 5, 5,42,43]
```

If giving `minimum` is unfeasable with the current resources (as it often comes to be the case in socialist communities...), for example if the above starting population had set a goal of giving anyone at least `30`, just return an empty array `[]`.

**Note**: This kata is a translation of this (Java) one: http://www.codewars.com/kata/rotate-array. I have not translated this first one as usual because I did not solved it, and I fear not being able to solve it (Java is **not** my cup of... tea). @cjmcgraw, if you want to use my translation on your kata feel free to use it.

Create a function named ""rotate"" that takes an array and returns a new one with the elements inside rotated n spaces.

If n is greater than 0 it should rotate the array to the right. If n is less than 0 it should rotate the array to the left. If n is 0, then it should return the array unchanged.

Example:
```python
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

rotate(data, 1) # => [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
rotate(data, 2) # => [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
rotate(data, 3) # => [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
rotate(data, 4) # => [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
rotate(data, 5) # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

rotate(data, 0) # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

rotate(data, -1) # => [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
rotate(data, -2) # => [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
rotate(data, -3) # => [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
rotate(data, -4) # => [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
rotate(data, -5) # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Furthermore the method should take ANY array of objects and perform this operation on them:
```python
rotate(['a', 'b', 'c'], 1)     # => ['c', 'a', 'b']
rotate([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 1)     # => [3.0, 1.0, 2.0]
rotate([True, True, False], 1) # => [False, True, True]
```

Finally the rotation shouldn't be limited by the indices available in the array. Meaning that if we exceed the indices of the array it keeps rotating.

Example:
```python
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

rotate(data, 7)     # => [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
rotate(data, 11)    # => [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
rotate(data, 12478) # => [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them. 

```a``` and ```b``` will both be positive integers, and ```a``` will always be the first number in the operation, and ```b``` always the second.

The four operators are ""add"", ""subtract"", ""divide"", ""multiply"". 

A few examples: 

``` javascript
ArithmeticFunction.arithmetic(5, 2, ""add"")      => returns 7
ArithmeticFunction.arithmetic(5, 2, ""subtract"") => returns 3
ArithmeticFunction.arithmetic(5, 2, ""multiply"") => returns 10
ArithmeticFunction.arithmetic(5, 2, ""divide"")   => returns 2
```

Imagine a funnel filled with letters. The bottom letter drops out of the funnel and onto a conveyor belt:

```
  \b,c/  -->   \b,c/
   \a/   -->    \ /
                 a
-------     -------
```
If there are two letters above a gap, the smaller letter falls into the gap.
```
  \b,c/   -->   \  c/ 
   \ /    -->    \b/   
a            a         
-------      -------
```
Of course, this can create a new gap, which must also be filled in the same way:
```
  \f,e,d/  -->  \f, ,d/
   \  c/   -->   \e,c/ 
    \b/           \b/   
   a            a         
  -------      -------
```
Once all the gaps above it have been filled, the bottom letter drops out of the funnel and onto the conveyorbelt. The process continues until all letters have fallen onto the conveyor. (New letters fall onto the end of the existing string)

**KATA GOAL: Return the string on the conveyorbelt after all letters have fallen**.
```
\f, ,d/      \f, ,d/   --> etc -->    \     /
 \e,c/        \e,c/    --> etc -->     \   /
  \b/    -->   \ /     --> etc -->      \ /
a           a   b                   abcdef
-------     -------                 -------
```
All letters in the funnel will be unique i.e. in every comparison one letter will be strictly smaller than the other. The funnel will be presented as a nested list, e.g:
```
[[""d"",""a"",""c""],
   [""b"",""e""],
     [""f""]]
```
The value of a letter is defined by its codepoint. Note: this means all capital letters are defined as smaller than all lower-case letters, but your language's comparison operator will probably treat it that way automatically.

The funnels will always be ""nice"" -- every layer will have 1 item more than the layer below, and every layer will be full, and generally there's no funny business or surprises to consider. The only characters used are standard uppercase and lowercase letters A-Z and a-z. The tests go up to 9 layer funnel.

Given a rational number n

``` n >= 0, with denominator strictly positive```  

- as a string (example: ""2/3"" in Ruby, Python, Clojure, JS, CS, Go) 
- or as two strings (example: ""2"" ""3"" in Haskell, Java, CSharp, C++, Swift) 
- or as a rational or decimal number (example: 3/4, 0.67 in R) 
- or two integers (Fortran)

decompose 
this number as a sum of rationals with numerators equal to one and without repetitions
(2/3 = 1/2 + 1/6 is correct but not 2/3 = 1/3 + 1/3, 1/3 is repeated).

The algorithm must be ""greedy"", so at each stage the new rational obtained in the decomposition must have a denominator as small as possible. 
In this manner the sum of a few fractions in the decomposition gives a rather good approximation of the rational to decompose.

2/3 = 1/3 + 1/3 doesn't fit because of the repetition but also because the first 1/3 has a denominator bigger than the one in 1/2 
in the decomposition 2/3 = 1/2 + 1/6.

### Example: 
(You can see other examples in ""Sample Tests:"")
```
decompose(""21/23"") or ""21"" ""23"" or 21/23 should return 

[""1/2"", ""1/3"", ""1/13"", ""1/359"", ""1/644046""] in Ruby, Python, Clojure, JS, CS, Haskell, Go

""[1/2, 1/3, 1/13, 1/359, 1/644046]"" in Java, CSharp, C++

""1/2,1/3,1/13,1/359,1/644046"" in C, Swift, R
```  

### Notes
1) The decomposition of 21/23 as
```
21/23 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/13 + 1/598 + 1/897
```
is exact but don't fulfill our requirement because 598 is bigger than 359.
Same for 
```
21/23 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/23 + 1/46 + 1/69 (23 is bigger than 13)
or 
21/23 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/15 + 1/110 + 1/253 (15 is bigger than 13).
```

2) The rational given to decompose could be greater than one or equal to one, in which case the first ""fraction"" will be an integer 
(with an implicit denominator of 1). 

3) If the numerator parses to zero the function ""decompose"" returns [] (or """".

4) The number could also be a decimal which can be expressed as a rational. 

examples:

`0.6` in Ruby, Python, Clojure,JS, CS, Julia, Go

`""66"" ""100""` in Haskell, Java, CSharp, C++, C, Swift, Scala, Kotlin

`0.67` in R.

Given a string of integers, return the number of odd-numbered substrings that can be formed. 

For example, in the case of `""1341""`, they are `1, 1, 3, 13, 41, 341, 1341`, a total of `7` numbers. 

`solve(""1341"") = 7`.  See test cases for more examples.

Good luck!

Description:

The mean (or average) is the most popular measure of central tendency; however it does not behave very well when the data is skewed (i.e. wages distribution). In such cases, it's better to use the median.

Your task for this kata is to find the median of an array consisting of n elements.

You can assume that all inputs are arrays of numbers in integer format. For the empty array your code should return `NaN` (false in JavaScript/`NULL` in PHP/`nil` in Ruby).

Examples:

Input `[1, 2, 3, 4]` --> Median `2.5`

Input `[3, 4, 1, 2, 5]` --> Median `3`

Make a function **""add""** that will be able to sum elements of **list** continuously and return a new list of sums.

For example: 

```
add [1,2,3,4,5] == [1, 3, 6, 10, 15], because it's calculated like 
this : [1, 1 + 2, 1 + 2 + 3, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5]

A nested list (or *array* in JavaScript) is a list that apears as a value inside another list, 
```python
[item, item, [item, item], item]

in the above list, [item, item] is a nested list.

**Steps**
1. Square the numbers that are greater than zero.
2. Multiply by 3 every third number.
3. Multiply by -1 every fifth number.
4. Return the sum of the sequence.

**Example**   
`{ -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 }` returns `-6`
```
1. { -2, -1, 0, 1 * 1, 2 * 2 }
2. { -2, -1, 0 * 3, 1, 4 }
3. { -2, -1, 0, 1, -1 * 4 }
4. -6
```

###Instructions

A time period starting from ```'hh:mm'``` lasting until ```'hh:mm'``` is stored in an array:
```
['08:14', '11:34']
```
A set of different time periods is then stored in a 2D Array like so, each in its own sub-array:
```
[['08:14','11:34'], ['08:16','08:18'], ['22:18','01:14'], ['09:30','10:32'], ['04:23','05:11'], ['11:48','13:48'], ['01:12','01:14'], ['01:13','08:15']]
```
Write a function that will take a 2D Array like the above as argument and return a 2D Array of the argument's sub-arrays sorted in ascending order.

Take note of the following:

* The first time period starts at the earliest time  possible ```('00:00'+)```.
* The next time period is the one that starts the soonest **after** the prior time period finishes. If several time periods begin at the same hour, pick the first one showing up in the original array.
* The next time period can start the same time the last one finishes.

This:
```
[['08:14','11:34'], ['08:16','08:18'], ['13:48','01:14'], ['09:30','10:32'], ['04:23','05:11'], ['11:48','13:48'], ['01:12','01:14'], ['01:13','08:15']]
```
Should return:
```
[['01:12','01:14'], ['04:23','05:11'], ['08:14','11:34'], ['11:48','13:48'], ['13:48','01:14'], ['08:16','08:18'], ['09:30','10:32'], ['01:13','08:15']]

Integral numbers can be even or odd.

Even numbers satisfy `n = 2m` ( with `m` also integral ) and we will ( completely arbitrarily ) think of odd numbers as `n = 2m + 1`.  
Now, some odd numbers can be more odd than others: when for some `n`, `m` is more odd than for another's. Recursively. :]  
Even numbers are just not odd.

# Task

Given a finite list of integral ( not necessarily non-negative ) numbers, determine the number that is _odder than the rest_.  
If there is no single such number, no number is odder than the rest; return `Nothing`, `null` or a similar empty value.

# Examples

```python
oddest([1,2]) => 1
oddest([1,3]) => 3
oddest([1,5]) => None
```

Do you _really_ want one? Point or tap here.

# Task
 A common way for prisoners to communicate secret messages with each other is to encrypt them. One such encryption algorithm goes as follows.

 You take the message and place it inside an `nx6` matrix (adjust the number of rows depending on the message length) going from top left to bottom right (one row at a time) while replacing spaces with dots (.) and adding dots at the end of the last row (if necessary) to complete the matrix.

 Once the message is in the matrix you read again from top left to bottom right but this time going one column at a time and treating each column as one word.

# Example

 The following message `""Attack at noon or we are done for""` is placed in a `6 * 6` matrix :
```
Attack
.at.no
on.or.
we.are
.done.
for...```
Reading it one column at a time we get:

 `A.ow.f tanedo tt..or a.oan. cnrre. ko.e..`

 - `[input]` string `msg`

  a regular english sentance representing the original message

Scheduling is how the processor decides which jobs (processes) get to use the processor and for how long. This can cause a lot of problems. Like a really long process taking the entire CPU and freezing all the other processes. One solution is Round-Robin, which today you will be implementing.

Round-Robin works by queuing jobs in a First In First Out fashion, but the processes are only given a short slice of time. If a processes is not finished in that time slice, it yields the proccessor and goes to the back of the queue.

For this Kata you will be implementing the 
```python
  def roundRobin(jobs, slice, index):
```

It takes in:

    1. ""jobs"" a non-empty positive integer array. It represents the queue and clock-cycles(cc) remaining till the job[i] is finished.

    2. ""slice"" a positive integer. It is the amount of clock-cycles that each job is given till the job yields to the next job in the queue.

    3. ""index"" a positive integer. Which is the index of the job we're interested in.

roundRobin returns:

    1. the number of cc till the job at index is finished.

Here's an example:
```
roundRobin([10,20,1], 5, 0) 
at 0cc [10,20,1] jobs[0] starts
after 5cc [5,20,1] jobs[0] yields, jobs[1] starts
after 10cc [5,15,1] jobs[1] yields, jobs[2] starts
after 11cc [5,15,0] jobs[2] finishes, jobs[0] starts
after 16cc [0,15,0] jobs[0] finishes
```

so:
```
roundRobin([10,20,1], 5, 0) == 16
```

**You can assume that the processor can switch jobs between cc so it does not add to the total time.

In genetics a reading frame is a way to divide a sequence of nucleotides (DNA bases) into a set of consecutive non-overlapping triplets (also called codon). Each of this triplets is translated into an amino-acid during a translation process to create proteins.

In a single strand of DNA you find 3 Reading frames, for example the following sequence:
```
AGGTGACACCGCAAGCCTTATATTAGC
```
will be decompose in:
```
Frame 1: AGG·TGA·CAC·CGC·AAG·CCT·TAT·ATT·AGC
Frame 2: A·GGT·GAC·ACC·GCA·AGC·CTT·ATA·TTA·GC
Frame 3: AG·GTG·ACA·CCG·CAA·GCC·TTA·TAT·TAG·C
```
In a double strand DNA you find 3 more Reading frames base on the reverse complement-strand, given the previous DNA sequence, in the reverse complement ( A-->T, G-->C, T-->A, C-->G).
Due to the splicing of DNA strands and the fixed reading direction of a nucleotide strand, the reverse complement gets read from right to left

```
                        AGGTGACACCGCAAGCCTTATATTAGC
Reverse complement:     TCCACTGTGGCGTTCGGAATATAATCG  
reversed reverse frame: GCTAATATAAGGCTTGCGGTGTCACCT
```

You have:
```
Reverse Frame 1: GCT AAT ATA AGG CTT GCG GTG TCA CCT
reverse Frame 2: G CTA ATA TAA GGC TTG CGG TGT CAC CT
reverse Frame 3: GC TAA TAT AAG GCT TGC GGT GTC ACC T
```

You can find more information about the Open Reading frame in wikipedia just [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frame)

Given the [standard table of genetic code](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi#SG1):

```
    AAs  = FFLLSSSSYY**CC*WLLLLPPPPHHQQRRRRIIIMTTTTNNKKSSRRVVVVAAAADDEEGGGG
  Base1  = TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
  Base2  = TTTTCCCCAAAAGGGGTTTTCCCCAAAAGGGGTTTTCCCCAAAAGGGGTTTTCCCCAAAAGGGG
  Base3  = TCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGTCAG
```

The tri-nucleotide TTT = F, TTC = F, TTA = L...

So our 6 frames will be translate as:

```
Frame 1: AGG·TGA·CAC·CGC·AAG·CCT·TAT·ATT·AGC
          R   *   H   R   K   P   Y   I   S

Frame 2: A·GGT·GAC·ACC·GCA·AGC·CTT·ATA·TTA·GC
             G  D   T   A   S   L   I   L  

Frame 3: AG·GTG·ACA·CCG·CAA·GCC·TTA·TAT·TAG·C
             V   T   P   Q   A   L   Y   *

Reverse Frame 1: GCT AAT ATA AGG CTT GCG GTG TCA CCT
                  A   N   I   R   L   A   V   S   P

Reverse Frame 2: G CTA ATA TAA GGC TTG CGG TGT CAC CT
                    L   I   *   G   L   R   C   H

Reverse Frame 3: GC TAA TAT AAG GCT TGC GGT GTC ACC T
                     *   Y   K   A   C   G   V   T

```

In this kata you should create a function that translates DNA on all 6 frames, this function takes 2 arguments.
The first one is the DNA sequence the second one is an array of frame number for example if we want to translate in Frame 1 and Reverse 1 this array will be [1,-1]. Valid frames are 1, 2, 3 and -1, -2, -3.

The translation hash is available for you under a translation hash `$codons` [Ruby] or `codon` [other languages] (for example to access value of 'TTT' you should  call $codons['TTT'] => 'F').

The function should return an array with all translation asked for, by default the function do the translation on all 6 frames.

# Task
 Given some points(array `A`) on the same line, determine the minimum number of line segments with length `L` needed to cover all of the given points. A point is covered if it is located inside some segment or on its bounds.

# Example

 For `A = [1, 3, 4, 5, 8]` and `L = 3`, the output should be `2`.

 Check out the image below for better understanding:

![](https://codefightsuserpics.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/segmentCover/img/example.png?_tm=1474900035857)

 For `A = [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` and `L = 1`, the output should be `3`.

 segment1: `1-2`(covered points 1,2), 

 segment2: `3-4`(covered points 3,4),

 segment3: `5-6`(covered point 5)

 For `A = [1, 10, 100, 1000]` and `L = 1`, the output should be `4`.

 segment1: `1-2`(covered point 1), 

 segment2: `10-11`(covered point 10),

 segment3: `100-101`(covered point 100), 

 segment4: `1000-1001`(covered point 1000)

# Input/Output

 - `[input]` integer array A

    Array of point coordinates on the line (all points are different).

    Constraints:

    `1 ≤ A.length ≤ 50,`

    `-5000 ≤ A[i] ≤ 5000.`

 - `[input]` integer `L`

    Segment length, a positive integer.

You've came to visit your grandma and she straight away found you a job - her Christmas tree needs decorating!

She first shows you a tree with an identified number of branches, and then hands you a some baubles (or loads of them!).

You know your grandma is a very particular person and she would like the baubles to be distributed in the orderly manner. You decide the best course of action would be to put the same number of baubles on each of the branches (if possible) or add one more bauble to some of the branches - starting from the beginning of the tree. 

In this kata you will return an array of baubles on each of the branches.

For example: 

10 baubles, 2 branches: [5,5]
5 baubles, 7 branches: [1,1,1,1,1,0,0]
12 baubles, 5 branches: [3,3,2,2,2]

The numbers of branches and baubles will be always greater or equal to 0.
If there are 0 branches return: ""Grandma, we will have to buy a Christmas tree first!"".

Good luck - I think your granny may have some minced pies for you if you do a good job!

# Task:

We define the ""self reversed power sequence"" as one shown below:

Implement a function that takes 2 arguments (`ord max` and `num dig`), and finds the smallest term of the sequence whose index is less than or equal to `ord max`, and has exactly `num dig` number of digits.

If there is a number with correct amount of digits, the result should be an array in the form:

```python
[True, smallest found term]
[False, -1]
```

## Input range:

```python
ord_max <= 1000
```

___

## Examples:

```python
min_length_num(5, 10) == [True, 10]   # 10th term has 5 digits
min_length_num(7, 11) == [False, -1]  # no terms before the 13th one have 7 digits
min_length_num(7, 14) == [True, 13]   # 13th term is the first one which has 7 digits
```

Which you can see in the table below:

```

Write a function which takes one parameter representing the dimensions of a checkered board. The board will always be square, so 5 means you will need a 5x5 board.

The dark squares will be represented by a unicode white square, while the light squares will be represented by a unicode black square (the opposite colours ensure the board doesn't look reversed on code wars' dark background). It should return a string of the board with a space in between each square and taking into account new lines. 

An even number should return a board that begins with a dark square. An odd number should return a board that begins with a light square.

The input is expected to be a whole number that's at least two, and returns false otherwise (Nothing in Haskell).

Examples:

```python
checkered_board(5)
```

returns the string
```
■ □ ■ □ ■
□ ■ □ ■ □
■ □ ■ □ ■
□ ■ □ ■ □
■ □ ■ □ ■
```

**There should be no trailing white space at the end of each line, or new line characters at the end of the string.**

**Note**   
Do not use HTML entities for the squares (e.g. `□` for white square) as the code doesn't consider it a valid square. A good way to check is if your solution prints a correct checker board on your local terminal.  

**Ruby note:**
CodeWars has encoding issues with rendered unicode in Ruby.
You'll need to use unicode source code (e.g. ""\u25A0"") instead of rendered unicode (e.g ""■"").

Your task is to create a function ```deepCount``` that returns the number of ALL elements within an array, including any within inner-level arrays.

For example:

```if:javascript
    deepCount([1, 2, 3]);  
    //>>>>> 3
    deepCount([""x"", ""y"", [""z""]]);  
    //>>>>> 4
    deepCount([1, 2, [3, 4, [5]]]);  
    //>>>>> 7
```
```if:ruby
    deepCount([1, 2, 3]);  
    //>>>>> 3
    deepCount([""x"", ""y"", [""z""]]);  
    //>>>>> 4
    deepCount([1, 2, [3, 4, [5]]]);  
    //>>>>> 7
```
```if:csharp
    deepCount([1, 2, 3]);  
    //>>>>> 3
    deepCount([""x"", ""y"", [""z""]]);  
    //>>>>> 4
    deepCount([1, 2, [3, 4, [5]]]);  
    //>>>>> 7
```
```if:php
    deep_c([1, 2, 3]);
    //>>>>> 3
    deep_c([""x"", ""y"", [""z""]]);
    //>>>>> 4
    deep_c([1, 2, [3, 4, [5]]]);
    //>>>>> 7
```
```if:python
    deepCount([1, 2, 3]);  
    //>>>>> 3
    deepCount([""x"", ""y"", [""z""]]);  
    //>>>>> 4
    deepCount([1, 2, [3, 4, [5]]]);  
    //>>>>> 7
```

The input will always be an array.

```if:php
In PHP you may *not* assume that the array passed in will be non-associative.

Please note that `count()`, `eval()` and `COUNT_RECURSIVE` are disallowed - you should be able to implement the logic for `deep_c()` yourself ;)

Given a certain integer  ```n, n > 0```and a number of partitions,  ```k, k > 0```; we want to know the partition which has the maximum or minimum product of its terms.

The function ```find_spec_partition() ```, will receive three arguments,  ```n```,  ```k```, and a command:  ```'max' or 'min'```

The function should output the partition that has maximum or minimum value product (it depends on the given command) as an array with its terms in decreasing order.

Let's see some cases (Python and Ruby)
```
find_spec_partition(10, 4, 'max') == [3, 3, 2, 2]
find_spec_partition(10, 4, 'min') == [7, 1, 1, 1]
```
and Javascript:
```
findSpecPartition(10, 4, 'max') == [3, 3, 2, 2]
findSpecPartition(10, 4, 'min') == [7, 1, 1, 1]
```
The partitions of 10 with 4 terms with their products are:
```
(4, 3, 2, 1): 24
(4, 2, 2, 2): 32
(6, 2, 1, 1): 12
(3, 3, 3, 1): 27
(4, 4, 1, 1): 16
(5, 2, 2, 1): 20

(3, 3, 2, 2): 36  <------- max.product value
(5, 3, 1, 1): 15

Your job is to write a function that takes a string and a maximum number of characters per line and then inserts line breaks as necessary so that no line in the resulting string is longer than the specified limit.

If possible, line breaks should not split words. However, if a single word is longer than the limit, it obviously has to be split. In this case, the line break should be placed after the first part of the word (see examples below).

Really long words may need to be split multiple times.

#Input

A word consists of one or more letters.

Input text will be the empty string or a string consisting of one or more words separated by single spaces. It will not contain any punctiation or other special characters.

The limit will always be an integer greater or equal to one.

#Examples

**Note:** Line breaks in the results have been replaced with two dashes to improve readability.

1. (""test"", 7) -> ""test""
2. (""hello world"", 7) -> ""hello--world""
3. (""a lot of words for a single line"", 10) -> ""a lot of--words for--a single--line""
4. (""this is a test"", 4) -> ""this--is a--test""
5. (""a longword"", 6) -> ""a long--word""
6. (""areallylongword"", 6) -> ""areall--ylongw--ord""

**Note:** Sometimes spaces are hard to see in the test results window.

*** Nova polynomial from roots*** 

This kata is from a series on polynomial handling. ( [#1](http://www.codewars.com/kata/nova-polynomial-1-add-1)   [#2](http://www.codewars.com/kata/570eb07e127ad107270005fe)  [#3](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5714041e8807940ff3001140 )   [#4](http://www.codewars.com/kata/571a2e2df24bdfd4e20001f5))

Consider a polynomial in a list where each element in the list element corresponds to the factors. The factor order is the position in the list. The first element is the zero order factor (the constant).

p = [a0, a1, a2, a3] signifies the polynomial a0 + a1x + a2x^2 + a3*x^3

In this kata create the polynomial from a list of roots:

[r0, r1 ,r2, r3 ]

p = (x-r0)(x-r1)(x-r2)(x-r3)

note: no roots should return the identity polynomial.

```python 
poly_from_roots([4]) = [-4, 1]
poly_from_roots([0, 0, 0, 0] ) = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
poly_from_roots([]) = [1]
```

###BACKGROUND:
Jacob recently decided to get healthy and lose some weight. He did a lot of reading and research and after focusing on steady exercise and a healthy diet for several months, was able to shed over 50 pounds! Now he wants to share his success, and has decided to tell his friends and family how much weight they could expect to lose if they used the same plan he followed.

Lots of people are really excited about Jacob's program and they want to know how much weight they would lose if they followed his plan. Unfortunately, he's really bad at math, so he's turned to you to help write a program that will calculate the expected weight loss for a particular person, given their weight and how long they think they want to continue the plan.

###TECHNICAL DETAILS:
Jacob's weight loss protocol, if followed closely, yields loss according to a simple formulae, depending on gender. Men can expect to lose 1.5% of their current body weight each week they stay on plan. Women can expect to lose 1.2%. (Children are advised to eat whatever they want, and make sure to play outside as much as they can!)

###TASK:
Write a function that takes as input:
```
- The person's gender ('M' or 'F');
- Their current weight (in pounds);
- How long they want to stay true to the protocol (in weeks);
```
and then returns the expected weight at the end of the program.

###NOTES:
Weights (both input and output) should be decimals, rounded to the nearest tenth.
Duration (input) should be a whole number (integer). If it is not, the function should round to the nearest whole number.
When doing input parameter validity checks, evaluate them in order or your code will not pass final tests.

Three candidates take part in a TV show.

In order to decide who will take part in the final game and probably become rich, they have to roll the Wheel of Fortune!

The Wheel of Fortune is divided into 20 sections, each with a number from 5 to 100 (only mulitples of 5).

Each candidate can roll the wheel once or twice and sum up the score of each roll.
The winner one that is closest to 100 (while still being lower or equal to 100). 
In case of a tie, the candidate that rolled the wheel first wins.

You receive the information about each candidate as an array of objects: each object should have a `name` and a `scores` array with the candidate roll values.

Your solution should return the name of the winner or `false` if there is no winner (all scored more than 100).

__Example:__

```python
c1 = {""name"": ""Bob"", ""scores"": [10, 65]}
c2 = {""name"": ""Bill"", ""scores"": [90, 5]}
c3 = {""name"": ""Charlie"", ""scores"": [40, 55]}
winner([c1, c2, c3]) #Returns ""Bill""
```

Please note that inputs may be invalid: in this case, the function should return false.

Potential errors derived from the specifications are:
- More or less than three candidates take part in the game.
- A candidate did not roll the wheel or rolled it more than twice.
- Scores are not valid.
- Invalid user entry (no name or no score).

The concept of ""[smooth number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_number)"" is applied to all those numbers whose prime factors are lesser than or equal to `7`: `60` is a smooth number (`2 * 2 * 3 * 5`), `111` is not (`3 * 37`).

More specifically, smooth numbers are classified by their highest prime factor and your are tasked with writing a `isSmooth`/`is_smooth` function that returns a string with this classification as it follows:

* 2-smooth numbers should be all defined as a `""power of 2""`, as they are merely that;
* 3-smooth numbers are to return a result of `""3-smooth""`;
* 5-smooth numbers will be labelled as `""Hamming number""`s (incidentally, you might appreciate [this nice kata on them](https://www.codewars.com/kata/hamming-numbers));
* 7-smooth numbers are classified as `""humble numbers""`s;
* for all the other numbers, just return `non-smooth`.

Examples:
```python
is_smooth(16) == ""power of 2""
is_smooth(36) == ""3-smooth""
is_smooth(60) == ""Hamming number""
is_smooth(98) == ""humble number""
is_smooth(111) == ""non-smooth""

The new £5 notes have been recently released in the UK and they've certainly became a sensation! Even those of us who haven't been carrying any cash around for a while, having given in to the convenience of cards, suddenly like to have some of these in their purses and pockets. But how many of them could you get with what's left from your salary after paying all bills? The programme that you're about to write will count this for you!

Given a salary and the array of bills, calculate your disposable income for a month and return it as a number of new £5 notes you can get with that amount. If the money you've got (or do not!) doesn't allow you to get any £5 notes return 0.

We need you to implement a method of receiving commands over a network, processing the information and responding.

Our device will send a single packet to you containing data and an instruction which you must perform before returning your reply.

To keep things simple, we will be passing a single ""packet"" as a string. 
Each ""byte"" contained in the packet is represented by 4 chars.

One packet is structured as below:
```
Header  Instruction   Data1    Data2   Footer
------   ------       ------   ------  ------
 H1H1     0F12         0012     0008    F4F4
------   ------       ------   ------  ------

The string received in this case would be - ""H1H10F1200120008F4F4""

Instruction: The calculation you should perform, always one of the below.
            0F12 = Addition
            B7A2 = Subtraction
            C3D9 = Multiplication
            FFFF = This instruction code should be used to identify your return value.
``` 
- The Header and Footer are unique identifiers which you must use to form your reply.

- Data1 and Data2 are the decimal representation of the data you should apply your instruction to. _i.e 0109 = 109._

- Your response must include the received header/footer, a ""FFFF"" instruction code, and the result of your calculation stored in Data1.

- Data2 should be zero'd out to ""0000"".

```
To give a complete example:

If you receive message ""H1H10F1200120008F4F4"".
The correct response would be ""H1H1FFFF00200000F4F4""

```
In the event that your calculation produces a negative result, the value returned should be ""0000"", similarily if the value is above 9999 you should return ""9999"".

Goodluck, I look forward to reading your creative solutions!

# History

This kata is a sequel of my [Mixbonacci](https://www.codewars.com/kata/mixbonacci/python) kata. Zozonacci is a special integer sequence named after [**ZozoFouchtra**](https://www.codewars.com/users/ZozoFouchtra), who came up with this kata idea in the [Mixbonacci discussion](https://www.codewars.com/kata/mixbonacci/discuss/python). 

This sequence combines the rules for computing the n-th elements of fibonacci, jacobstal, pell, padovan, tribonacci and tetranacci sequences according to a given pattern.

# Task

Compute the first `n` elements of the Zozonacci sequence for a given pattern `p`.

## Rules

1. `n` is given as integer and `p` is given as a list of as abbreviations as strings (e.g. `[""fib"", ""jac"", ""pad""]`)
2. When `n` is 0 or `p` is empty return an empty list.
3. The first four elements of the sequence are determined by the first abbreviation in the pattern (see the table below).
4. Compute the fifth element using the formula corespoding to the first element of the pattern, the sixth element using the formula for the second element and so on. (see the table below and the examples)
5. If `n` is more than the length of `p` repeat the pattern.

```
+------------+--------------+------------------------------------------+---------------------+
|  sequence  | abbreviation |         formula for n-th element         | first four elements |
+------------|--------------+------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| fibonacci  |     fib      | a[n] = a[n-1] + a[n-2]                   |     0, 0, 0, 1      |
| jacobsthal |     jac      | a[n] = a[n-1] + 2 * a[n-2]               |     0, 0, 0, 1      |
| padovan    |     pad      | a[n] = a[n-2] + a[n-3]                   |     0, 1, 0, 0      |
| pell       |     pel      | a[n] = 2 * a[n-1] + a[n-2]               |     0, 0, 0, 1      |
| tetranacci |     tet      | a[n] = a[n-1] + a[n-2] + a[n-3] + a[n-4] |     0, 0, 0, 1      |
| tribonacci |     tri      | a[n] = a[n-1] + a[n-2] + a[n-3]          |     0, 0, 0, 1      |
+------------+--------------+------------------------------------------+---------------------+
```

## Example

```
zozonacci([""fib"", ""tri""], 7) == [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

Explanation: 

          b     d
       /-----\/----\
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
 \--------/  
     | \--------/
     a     c

a - [0, 0, 0, 1] as ""fib"" is the first abbreviation
b - 5th element is 1 as the 1st element of the pattern is ""fib"": 1 = 0 + 1
c - 6th element is 2 as the 2nd element of the pattern is ""tri"": 2 = 0 + 1 + 1
d - 7th element is 3 as the 3rd element of the pattern is ""fib"" (see rule no. 5): 3 = 2 + 1
```

Assume you are creating a webshop and you would like to help the user in the search. You have products with brands, prices and name. You have the history of opened products (the most recently opened being the first item).

Your task is to create a list of brands ordered by popularity, if two brands have the same popularity level then choose the one which was opened last from the two and second the other one.

Product popularity is calculated from the history. If a product is more times in the history than it is more popular.

Your function will have one parameter which will be always an array/list of object.

example product:
{
  name: ""Phone"",
  price: 25,
  brand: ""Fake brand""

# Description:

```if:javascript
Given an array `arr` that contains some integers(positive, negative or 0), and a `range` list such as `[[start1,end1],[start2,end2],...]`, start and end are the index of `arr` and start always less than end. Your task is to calculate the sum value of each range (start index and end index are both inclusive), and return the maximum sum value.
```
```if:ruby
Given an array (`arr`) of integers and an array (`ranges`) of ranges (e.g. `[[1, 32], [16, 24],...]`), which represent an index range of `arr`, calculate the sum of each range (start index and end index are both inclusive) of `arr`, and return the maximum sum.
```
```if:php
Given an array `$a` that contains some integers and a `$range` list such as `[[$start1, $end1], [$start2, $end2], ... ]` where `$start(n)` and `$end(n)` are valid keys of the non-associative array `$a` and `$start(n)` is always guaranteed to be strictly less than `$end(n)`.  Your task is to calculate the sum value of each range (start index and end index are both inclusive) and return the maximum sum value.
```
```if:haskell
Given a list `arr` that contains some integers(positive, negative or 0), and a `range` list such as `[(start1,end1),(start2,end2),...]`, start and end are the index of `arr` and start always less than end. Your task is to calculate the sum value of each range (start index and end index are both inclusive), and return the maximum sum value.
```

For example:

# Note:

 - `arr`/`$a` always has at least 5 elements;
 - `range`/`$range`/`ranges` always has at least 1 element;
 - All inputs are valid;

# Task
 Given an array `arr`, find the rank of the element at the ith position.

 The `rank` of the arr[i] is a value equal to the number of elements `less than or equal to` arr[i] standing before arr[i], plus the number of elements `less than` arr[i] standing after arr[i].

# Example

 For `arr = [2,1,2,1,2], i = 2`, the result should be `3`.

 There are 2 elements `less than or equal to` arr[2] standing before arr[2]: 

 `arr[0] <= arr[2]`

 `arr[1] <= arr[2]`

 There is only 1 element `less than` arr[2] standing after arr[2]: 

 `arr[3] < arr[2]`

 So the result is `2 + 1 = 3`.

# Input/Output

 - `[input]` integer array `arr`

  An array of integers.

  `3 <= arr.length <= 50.`

 - `[input]` integer `i`

  Index of the element whose rank is to be found.

 - `[output]` an integer

  Rank of the element at the ith position.

Adding tip to a restaurant bill in a graceful way can be tricky, thats why you need make a function for it.

The function will receive the restaurant bill (always a positive number) as an argument. You need to 1) **add at least 15%** in tip, 2) round that number up to an *elegant* value and 3) return it.

What is an *elegant* number? It depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded. Numbers below 10 should simply be rounded to whole numbers. Numbers 10 and above should be rounded like this:

10 - 99.99... ---> Round to number divisible by 5

100 - 999.99... ---> Round to number divisible by 50

1000 - 9999.99... ---> Round to number divisible by 500

And so on...

Good luck!

## The galactic games have begun!

It's the galactic games! Beings of all worlds come together to compete in several interesting sports, like nroogring, fredling and buzzing (the beefolks love the last one). However, there's also the traditional marathon run.

Unfortunately, there have been cheaters in the last years, and the committee decided to place sensors on the track. Committees being committees, they've come up with the following rule:

> A sensor should be placed every 3 and 5 meters from the start, e.g.
> at 3m, 5m, 6m, 9m, 10m, 12m, 15m, 18m….

Since you're responsible for the track, you need to buy those sensors. Even worse, you don't know how long the track will be! And since there might be more than a single track, and you can't be bothered to do all of this by hand, you decide to write a program instead.

## Task
Return the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 __below__ a number. Being the _galactic_ games, the tracks can get rather large, so your solution should work for _really_ large numbers (greater than 1,000,000).

### Examples
```python
solution (10) # => 23 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9
solution (20) # => 78 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18

Write a method `alternate_sq_sum()` (JS: `alternateSqSum` ) that takes an array of integers as input and finds the sum of squares of the elements at even positions (*i.e.,* 2nd, 4th, *etc.*) plus the sum of the rest of the elements at odd position.

NOTE:
The values at even *position* need to be squared. For a language with zero-based indices, this will occur at oddly-indexed locations. For instance, in Python, the values at indices 1, 3, 5, *etc.* should be squared because these are the second, fourth, and sixth positions in the list.
For Example:

```python
alternate_sq_sum([11, 12, 13, 14, 15]) #should return 379
```

Explanation:

Elements at indices 0, 2, 4 are 11, 13, 15 and they are at odd positions as 11 is at position #1, 13 is at position #3 and 15 at #5.

Elements at indices 1, 3 are 12 and 14 and they are at even position.
So we need to add 11, 13, 15 as they are and square of 12 and 14

--> 11 + 13 + 15 + 12^2 + 14^2
  = 11 + 13 + 15 + 144 + 196
  = 379

For empty arrays, result should be 0 (zero) (except for Haskell).

Mike and Joe are fratboys that love beer and games that involve drinking. They play the following game: Mike chugs one beer, then Joe chugs 2 beers, then Mike chugs 3 beers, then Joe chugs 4 beers, and so on. Once someone can't drink what he is supposed to drink, he loses.

Mike can chug at most A beers in total (otherwise he would pass out), while Joe can chug at most B beers in total. Who will win the game? 

Write the function ```game(A,B)``` that returns the winner, ```""Mike""``` or ```""Joe""``` accordingly, for any given integer values of A and B.

In this kata, you have to define a function named **func** that will take a list as input.

You must try and guess the pattern how we get the output number and return list - **[output number,binary representation,octal representation,hexadecimal representation]**, but **you must convert that specific number without built-in : bin,oct and hex functions.**

Examples : 

```python
func([12,13,6,3,6,45,123]) returns - [29,'11101','35','1d']

func([1,9,23,43,65,31,63,99]) returns - [41,'101001','51','29']

func([2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,19]) returns - [10,'1010','12','a']

Implement a function which 
creates a **[radix tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree)** (a space-optimized trie [prefix tree]) 
in which each node that is the only child is merged with its parent [unless a word from the input ends there]) 
from a given list of words 
using dictionaries (aka hash maps or hash tables) where:

1. The dictionary keys are the nodes.
2. Leaf nodes are empty dictionaries.
3. The value for empty input is an empty dictionary.
4. Words are all lowercase or empty strings.
5. Words can contain duplicates.

### Examples:

```python
>>> radix_tree()
{}

>>> radix_tree("""")
{}

>>> radix_tree("""", """")
{}

>>> radix_tree(""radix"", ""tree"")
{""radix"": {}, ""tree"": {}}

# Task

John won the championship of a TV show. He can get some bonuses.

He needs to play a game to determine the amount of his bonus.

Here are `n` rows and `m` columns of cards were placed on the ground. A non-negative number is written on each card.

The rules of the game are:

- Player starts from the top-left coner, walk to the bottom-right coner. 

- Players can only walk downward or right. 

- The sum of the numbers collected by the players will be used as the bonus.

John has two chances to play this game on a game map. Specifically, when John finishes the game, the card on his path will be removed, and then he can walk again.

Your task is to help John calculate the maximum amount of bonuses he can get.

# Input

- `gameMap/gamemap`: A `n` x `m` integer array. Each element represents the number on the card.
  - `4 <= n,m <= 40(Pyhon)/100(JS)`

- All inputs are valid.

# Output

An integer. the maximum amount of bonuses John can get.

# Eaxmple

For 
```
gameMap=
[
[1, 3, 9],
[2, 8, 5],
[5, 7, 4]
]
```
The output should be `39`.

One of the possible solution is:
```
1st game:
[
[>, >, v],
[2, 8, v],
[5, 7, v]
]
1+3+9+5+4=22

2nd game:
[
[v, 0, 0],
[>, v, 0],
[5, >, >]
]
0+2+8+7+0=17

Final bonus = 22 + 17 = 39

# Leaderboard climbers

In this kata you will be given a leaderboard of unique names for example:

```python
['John',
 'Brian',
 'Jim',
 'Dave',
 'Fred']
```

Then you will be given a list of strings for example:

```python
['Dave +1', 'Fred +4', 'Brian -1']
```

Then you sort the leaderboard.

The steps for our example would be:

```python
# Dave up 1
['John',
 'Brian',
 'Dave',
 'Jim',
 'Fred']
```

```python
# Fred up 4
['Fred',
 'John',
 'Brian',
 'Dave',
 'Jim']
```

```python
# Brian down 1
['Fred',
 'John',
 'Dave',
 'Brian',
 'Jim']
```

Then once you have done this you need to return the leaderboard.

All inputs will be valid. All strings in the second list will never ask to move a name up higher or lower than possible eg. `""John +3""` could not be added to the end of the second input list in the example above.

The strings in the second list will always be something in the leaderboard followed by a space and a `+` or `-` sign followed by a number.

Error Handling is very important in coding and seems to be overlooked or not implemented properly.

#Task

Your task is to implement a function which takes a string as input and return an object containing the properties
vowels and consonants. The vowels property must contain the total count of vowels {a,e,i,o,u}, and the total count of consonants {a,..,z} - {a,e,i,o,u}. Handle invalid input and don't forget to return valid ones.

#Input

The input is any random string. You must then discern what are vowels and what are consonants and sum for each category their total occurrences in an object. However you could also receive inputs that are not strings. If this happens then you must return an object with a vowels and consonants total of 0 because the input was NOT a string. Refer to the Example section for a more visual representation of which inputs you could receive and the outputs expected. :)

Example:

```python
Input: get_count('test')
Output: {vowels:1,consonants:3}

Input: get_count('tEst')
Output: {vowels:1,consonants:3}

Input get_count('    ')
Output: {vowels:0,consonants:0}

Input get_count()
Output: {vowels:0,consonants:0}
```

The new football league season is coming and the Football Association need some help resetting the league standings. Normally the initial league standing is done in alphabetical order (from A to Z) but this year the FA have decided to freshen it up. 

It has been decided that team who finished first last season will begin the next season in first place. Regardless of what letter their club begins with. e.g. if Manchester City were in first place last year, they will begin the season in position one. All other teams should be in alphabetical order. 

The teams will be fed in as an object ({}). The key will be will be their position from last season and the value is the club's name e.g. Arsenal. 

The output should be an object ({}) with the key as the club's starting position for the new season and the value should be club's name e.g. Arsenal.

For example. If in the previous season the standings were:

1:'Leeds United'
2:'Liverpool'
3:'Manchester City'
4:'Coventry'
5:'Arsenal' 

Then the new season standings should 

1:'Leeds United' (first last season)
2:'Arsenal' (alphabetical)
3:'Coventry' (alphabetical) 
4:'Liverpool' (alphabetical) 
5:'Manchester City' (alphabetical)

Farmer Bob have a big farm, where he growths chickens, rabbits and cows. It is very difficult to count the number of animals for each type manually, so he diceded to buy a system to do it. But he bought a cheap system that can count only total number of heads, total number of legs and total number of horns of animals on the farm.
Help Bob to figure out how many chickens, rabbits and cows does he have?

All chickens have 2 legs, 1 head and no horns; all rabbits have 4 legs, 1 head and no horns; all cows have 4 legs, 1 head and 2 horns.

Your task is to write a function 
```Python
get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number)
```
```Csharp
Dictionary get_animals_count(int legs_number, int heads_number, int horns_number)
```
, which returns a dictionary 
```python
{""rabbits"" : rabbits_count, ""chickens"" : chickens_count, ""cows"" : cows_count}
``` 
```Csharp
new Dictionary(){{""rabbits"", rabbits_count},{""chickens"", chickens_count},{""cows"", cows_count}}
```

Parameters `legs_number, heads_number, horns_number` are integer, all tests have valid input.

Example:

```python
get_animals_count(34, 11, 6); # Should return {""rabbits"" : 3, ""chickens"" : 5, ""cows"" : 3}
get_animals_count(154, 42, 10); # Should return {""rabbits"" : 30, ""chickens"" : 7, ""cows"" : 5}
```

```Csharp
get_animals_count(34, 11, 6); //Should return  Dictionary(){{""rabbits"", 3},{""chickens"", 5},{""cows"", 3}}
get_animals_count(154, 42, 10); //Should return Dictionary(){{""rabbits"", 30},{""chickens"", 7},{""cows"", 5}}

Hi guys, welcome to introduction to DocTesting.

The kata is composed of two parts; in part (1) we write three small functions, and in part (2) we write a few doc tests for those functions.

Lets talk about the functions first...

    The reverse_list function takes a list and returns the reverse of it.
    If given an empty list, simply return an empty list.

The second function...

    The sum_list function takes a list as input and adds up all the values, 
    returning an integer. If the list is empty, return 0.

The third function...

    The head_of_list function simply returns the first item in the list.
    If the list is empty return None.

Each of these functions can be easily written with a single line of code; there are some tests for correctness but no tests for effciency.

Once you have implemented all three of these functions you can move onto phase two, which is writing doc tests. If you haven't written doc tests before then I suggest you check out the following documentation: 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html

To complete this kata all you have to do is write **EXACTLY TWO** doc tests for each of the three functions (any more/less than that and you will fail the tests).

Here is an example:

    def double(y):
      """"""Function returns y * 2
      >>> double(2)
      4
      """"""
      return y * 2

In the example above we have a function called 'double' and a single doctest. When we run the doctest module Python will check if double(2) equals 4. If it does not, then the doctest module will flag up an error.

Please note that this is intended as a beginners introduction to docstrings, if you try to do something clever (such as writing doc tests to catch exceptions, or tinkering with the 'option flags'), you will probably fail a test or two. This is due to how the tests are written.  

Oh and one last thing, don't try and get too 'cheeky' and try something like:

    """"""
    >>> True
    True
    """"""

such a solution is (a) not in the spirit of things and (b) I got tests for that! :p

Good Luck!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Issues & Helpful hints ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) In addition to the 'don't get too clever rule', please try to be precise when making your doctests; [1,2] may fail where [1, 2] may succeed. Likewise, "">>>function(x)"" may fail where "">>> function(x)"" is likely to suceed *(note the difference is single "" "" character)*. In short, if you fail a test the first thing to check is that you dont have any unecessary characters/spaces and/or odd formating.

2) As you shall see from the kata discussion testing for None is tricky and lots of people are struggling to get None tests working. So I'm going to quickly show you a way to test for not that will (should) pass the kata:

    def is_string(string):
        """"""
        returns the string if the string is Not empty, otherwise returns None
        >>> is_string("""") is None
        True
        """"""
        return string if string else None

3) If you happen to be struggling to actually complete the three functions in the first place then I would recomend you google *""Python Indexing"", ""Pythons sum function"" and ""if/else statements in Python""*.

Given a name, turn that name into a perfect square matrix (nested array with the amount of arrays equivalent to the length of each array). 

You will need to add periods (`.`) to the end of the name if necessary, to turn it into a matrix. 

If the name has a length of 0, return `""name must be at least one letter""`

## Examples

""Bill"" ==> [ [""B"", ""i""],
             [""l"", ""l""] ]

Given a random string consisting of numbers, letters, symbols, you need to sum up the numbers in the string. 

Note:

- Consecutive integers should be treated as a single number. eg, `2015` should be treated as a single number `2015`, NOT four numbers
- All the numbers should be treaded as positive integer. eg, `11-14` should be treated as two numbers `11` and `14`. Same as `3.14`, should be treated as two numbers `3` and `14`
- If no number was given in the string, it should return `0`

Example:

```
str = ""In 2015, I want to know how much does iPhone 6+ cost?""
```

 The numbers are `2015`, `6`

Sum is `2021`.

## Emotional Sort ( ︶︿︶)

You'll have a function called ""**sortEmotions**"" that will return an array of **emotions** sorted. It has two parameters, the first parameter called ""**arr**"" will expect an array of **emotions** where an **emotion** will be one of the following:

- **:D** -> Super Happy
- **:)** -> Happy
- **:|** -> Normal
- **:(** -> Sad
- **T\_T** -> Super Sad

Example of the array:``[ 'T_T', ':D', ':|', ':)', ':(' ]``

And the second parameter is called ""**order**"", if this parameter is **true** then the order of the emotions will be descending (from **Super Happy** to **Super Sad**) if it's **false** then it will be ascending (from **Super Sad** to **Super Happy**)

Example if **order** is true with the above array: ``[ ':D', ':)', ':|', ':(', 'T_T' ]``

- Super Happy -> Happy -> Normal -> Sad -> Super Sad

If **order** is false: ``[ 'T_T', ':(', ':|', ':)', ':D' ]``

- Super Sad -> Sad -> Normal -> Happy -> Super Happy

Example:
```
arr = [':D', ':|', ':)', ':(', ':D']
sortEmotions(arr, true) // [ ':D', ':D', ':)', ':|', ':(' ]
sortEmotions(arr, false) // [ ':(', ':|', ':)', ':D', ':D' ]

```

**More in test cases!**

Notes:
- The array could be empty, in that case return the same empty array ¯\\\_( ツ )\_/¯
- All **emotions** will be valid

Python dictionaries are inherently unsorted. So what do you do if you need to sort the contents of a dictionary?

Create a function that returns a sorted list of `(key, value)` tuples (Javascript: arrays of 2 items).

The list must be sorted by the `value` and be sorted **largest to smallest**.

## Examples

```python
sort_dict({3:1, 2:2, 1:3}) == [(1,3), (2,2), (3,1)]
sort_dict({1:2, 2:4, 3:6}) == [(3,6), (2,4), (1,2)]

You are making your very own boardgame. The game is played by two opposing players, featuring a 6 x 6 tile system, with the players taking turns to move their pieces (similar to chess). The design is finished, now it's time to actually write and implement the features. Being the good programmer you are, you carefully plan the procedure and break the program down into smaller managable sections. You decide to start coding the logic for resolving ""fights"" when two pieces engage in combat on a tile. 

Your boardgame features four unique pieces: 

Swordsman, Cavalry, Archer and Pikeman

Each piece has unique movement and has advantages and weaknesses in combat against one of the other pieces. 

Task

You must write a function ```fightResolve``` that takes the attacking and defending piece as input parameters, and returns the winning piece. It may be the case that both the attacking and defending piece belong to the same player, after which you must return an error value to indicate an illegal move. 

In C++ and C, the pieces will be represented as ```chars```. Values will be case-sensitive to display ownership. Let the following char values represent each piece from their respective player.

Player 1:  ```p```= Pikeman, ```k```= Cavalry, ```a```= Archer, ```s```= Swordsman 

Player 2:  ```P```= Pikeman, ```K```= Cavalry, ```A```= Archer, ```S```= Swordsman 

The outcome of the fight between two pieces depends on which piece attacks, the type of the attacking piece and the type of the defending piece. Archers always win against swordsmens, swordsmen always win against pikemen, pikemen always win against cavalry and cavalry always win against archers. If a matchup occurs that was not previously mentioned (for example Archers vs Pikemen) the attacker will always win. This table represents the winner of each possible engagement between an attacker and a defender.

(Attacker→)
    (Defender↓)
Archer
Pikeman
Swordsman
Knight

Knight
Defender
Attacker
Attacker
Attacker

Swordsman
Attacker
Defender
Attacker
Attacker

Archer
Attacker
Attacker
Defender
Attacker

Pikeman
Attacker
Attacker
Attacker
Defender

If two pieces from the same player engage in combat, i.e P vs S or k vs a, the function must return -1 to signify and illegal move. Otherwise assume that no other illegal values will be passed.

Examples

Function prototype: fightResolve(defender, attacker)
1. fightResolve('a', 'P') outputs 'P'. No interaction defined between Pikemen and Archer. Pikemen is the winner here because it is the attacking piece.

2. fightResolve('k', 'A') outputs 'k'. Knights always defeat archers, even if Archer is the attacking piece here.

3. fightResolve('S', 'A') outputs -1. Friendly units don't fight. Return -1 to indicate error.

Ahoy Matey!

Welcome to the seven seas.

You are the captain of a pirate ship.

You are in battle against the royal navy.

You have cannons at the ready.... or are they?

Your task is to check if the gunners are loaded and ready, if they are: ```Fire!```

If they aren't ready: ```Shiver me timbers!```

Your gunners for each test case are 4 or less.

When you check if they are ready their answers are in a dictionary and will either be: ```aye``` or ```nay```

Firing with less than all gunners ready is non-optimum (this is not fire at will, this is fire by the captain's orders or walk the plank, dirty sea-dog!)

If all answers are 'aye' then Fire!
if one or more are 'nay' then Shiver me timbers!

Also, check out the new Pirates!! Kata:

You are going to be given a word. Your job will be to make sure that each character in that word has the exact same number of occurrences. You will return `true` if it is valid, or `false` if it is not.

For example:

`""abcabc""` is a valid word because `'a'` appears twice, `'b'` appears twice, and`'c'` appears twice.  
`""abcabcd""` is **NOT** a valid word because `'a'` appears twice, `'b'` appears twice, `'c'` appears twice, but `'d'` only appears once!  
`""123abc!""` is a valid word because all of the characters only appear once in the word.

For this kata, capitals are considered the same as lowercase letters. Therefore: `'A' == 'a'` .

#Input 
A string (no spaces) containing `[a-z],[A-Z],[0-9]` and common symbols. The length will be `0 < string < 100`.

#Output
`true` if the word is a valid word, or `false` if the word is not valid.

Write a function that takes one or more arrays and returns a new array of unique values in the order of the original provided arrays.

In other words, all values present from all arrays should be included in their original order, but with no duplicates in the final array.

The unique numbers should be sorted by their original order, but the final array should not be sorted in numerical order.

Check the assertion tests for examples.

Brief
=====
Sometimes we need information about the list/arrays we're dealing with. You'll have to write such a function in this kata. Your function must provide the following informations:  

* Length of the array
* Number of integer items in the array
* Number of float items in the array
* Number of string character items in the array
* Number of whitespace items in the array

The informations will be supplied in arrays that are items of another array. Like below:

`Output array = [[array length],[no of integer items],[no of float items],[no of string chars items],[no of whitespace items]]`

Added Difficulty
----------------
If any item count in the array is zero, you'll have to replace it with a **None/nil/null** value (according to the language). And of course, if the array is empty then return **'Nothing in the array!**. For the sake of simplicity, let's just suppose that there are no nested structures.   
Output
======
If you're head is spinning (just kidding!) then these examples will help you out-   
```

array_info([1,2,3.33,4,5.01,'bass','kick',' '])--------->[[8],[3],[2],[2],[1]]    
array_info([0.001,2,' '])------------------------------>[[3],[1],[1],[None],[1]]   
array_info([])----------------------------------------->'Nothing in the array!'
array_info([' '])-------------------------------------->[[1],[None],[None],[None],[1]]

  ```    
Remarks
-------
The input will always be arrays/lists. So no need to check the inputs.

If the first day of the month is a Friday, it is likely that the month will have an `Extended Weekend`. That is, it could have five Fridays, five Saturdays and five Sundays. 

In this Kata, you will be given a start year and an end year. Your task will be to find months that have extended weekends and return:
```
- The first and last month in the range that has an extended weekend
- The number of months that have extended weekends in the range, inclusive of start year and end year.
```

For example:
```python
solve(2016,2020) = (""Jan"",""May"",5). #The months are: Jan 2016, Jul 2016, Dec 2017, Mar 2019, May 2020
```

More examples in test cases. Good luck!

It's the most hotly anticipated game of the school year - Gryffindor vs Slytherin! Write a function which returns the winning team. 

You will be given two arrays with two values. 

The first given value is the number of points scored by the team's Chasers and the second a string with a 'yes' or 'no' value if the team caught the golden snitch!

The team who catches the snitch wins their team an extra 150 points - but doesn't always win them the game.

If the score is a tie return ""It's a draw!""""

** The game only ends when someone catches the golden snitch, so one array will always include 'yes' or 'no.' Points scored by Chasers can be any positive integer.

In Math, an improper fraction is a fraction where the numerator (the top number) is greater than or equal to the denominator (the bottom number) For example: ```5/3``` (five third).

A mixed numeral is a whole number and a fraction combined into one ""mixed"" number. For example: ```1 1/2``` (one and a half) is a mixed numeral.

## Task

Write a function `convertToMixedNumeral` to convert the improper fraction into a mixed numeral.

The input will be given as a ```string``` (e.g. ```'4/3'```).

The output should be a ```string```, with a space in between the whole number and the fraction (e.g. ```'1 1/3'```).  You do not need to reduce the result to its simplest form.

For the purpose of this exercise, there will be no ```0```, ```empty string``` or ```null``` input value. However, the input can be:

- a negative fraction
- a fraction that does not require conversion
- a fraction that can be converted into a whole number

You are given an initial 2-value array (x). You will use this to calculate a score.

If both values in (x) are numbers, the score is the sum of the two. If only one is a number, the score is that number. If neither is a number, return 'Void!'.

Once you have your score, you must return an array of arrays. Each sub array will be the same as (x) and the number of sub arrays should be equal to the score.

For example:

if (x) == ['a', 3]  you should return [['a', 3], ['a', 3], ['a', 3]].

# Base64 Numeric Translator

Our standard numbering system is (Base 10). That includes 0 through 9. Binary is (Base 2), only 1’s and 0’s.  And Hexadecimal is (Base 16) (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F). A hexadecimal “F” has a (Base 10) value of 15. (Base 64) has 64 individual characters which translate in value in (Base 10) from between 0 to 63.

####Write a method that will convert a string from (Base 64) to it's (Base 10) integer value.

The (Base 64) characters from least to greatest will be
```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/
```
Where 'A' is equal to 0 and '/' is equal to 63.

Just as in standard (Base 10) when you get to the highest individual integer 9 the next number adds an additional place and starts at the beginning 10; so also (Base 64) when you get to the 63rd digit '/' and the next number adds an additional place and starts at the beginning ""BA"".

Example:
```
base64_to_base10(""/"") # => 63
base64_to_base10(""BA"") # => 64
base64_to_base10(""BB"") # => 65
base64_to_base10(""BC"") # => 66
```

Write a method `base64_to_base10` that will take a string (Base 64) number and output it's (Base 10) value as an integer.

In this kata, you will write a function that returns the positions and the values of the ""peaks"" (or local maxima) of a numeric array.

For example, the array `arr = [0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 0]` has a peak at position `3` with a value of `5` (since `arr[3]` equals `5`).

~~~if-not:php,cpp,java,csharp
The output will be returned as an object with two properties: pos and peaks. Both of these properties should be arrays. If there is no peak in the given array, then the output should be `{pos: [], peaks: []}`.
~~~
~~~if:php
The output will be returned as an associative array with two key-value pairs: `'pos'` and `'peaks'`.  Both of them should be (non-associative) arrays.  If there is no peak in the given array, simply return `['pos' => [], 'peaks' => []]`.
~~~
~~~if:cpp
The output will be returned as an object of type `PeakData` which has two members: `pos` and `peaks`.  Both of these members should be `vector`s.  If there is no peak in the given array then the output should be a `PeakData` with an empty vector for both the `pos` and `peaks` members.

`PeakData` is defined in Preloaded as follows:

~~~
~~~if:java
The output will be returned as a ``Map>` with two key-value pairs: `""pos""` and `""peaks""`. If there is no peak in the given array, simply return `{""pos"" => [], ""peaks"" => []}`.
~~~
~~~if:csharp
The output will be returned as a `Dictionary>` with two key-value pairs: `""pos""` and `""peaks""`. 
If there is no peak in the given array, simply return `{""pos"" => new List(), ""peaks"" => new List()}`.
~~~

Example: `pickPeaks([3, 2, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3])` should return `{pos: [3, 7], peaks: [6, 3]}` (or equivalent in other languages)

All input arrays will be valid integer arrays (although it could still be empty), so you won't need to validate the input.

The first and last elements of the array will not be considered as peaks (in the context of a mathematical function, we don't know what is after and before and therefore, we don't know if it is a peak or not).

Also, beware of plateaus !!! `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` has a peak while `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]` does not. In case of a plateau-peak, please only return the position and value of the beginning of the plateau. For example: 
`pickPeaks([1, 2, 2, 2, 1])` returns `{pos: [1], peaks: [2]}` (or equivalent in other languages)

Have fun!

Lеt's create function to play cards. Our rules:

We have the preloaded `deck`:

```
deck = ['joker','2♣','3♣','4♣','5♣','6♣','7♣','8♣','9♣','10♣','J♣','Q♣','K♣','A♣',
                '2♦','3♦','4♦','5♦','6♦','7♦','8♦','9♦','10♦','J♦','Q♦','K♦','A♦',
                '2♥','3♥','4♥','5♥','6♥','7♥','8♥','9♥','10♥','J♥','Q♥','K♥','A♥',
                '2♠','3♠','4♠','5♠','6♠','7♠','8♠','9♠','10♠','J♠','Q♠','K♠','A♠']
```

We have 3 arguments:

`card1` and `card2` - any card of our deck.

`trump` - the main suit of four ('♣', '♦', '♥', '♠').

If both cards have the same suit, the big one wins.

If the cards have different suits (and no one has trump) return 'Let's play again.'

If one card has `trump` unlike another, wins the first one.

If both cards have `trump`, the big one wins.

If `card1` wins, return 'The first card won.' and vice versa.

If the cards are equal, return 'Someone cheats.'

A few games:

```
('3♣', 'Q♣', '♦') -> 'The second card won.'

('5♥', 'A♣', '♦') -> 'Let us play again.'

('8♠', '8♠', '♣') -> 'Someone cheats.'

('2♦', 'A♠', '♦') -> 'The first card won.'

('joker', 'joker', '♦') -> 'Someone cheats.'

```
P.S. As a card you can also get the string 'joker' - it means this card always wins.

Write a comparator for a list of phonetic words for the letters of the [greek alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet).

A comparator is:
> *a custom comparison function of two arguments (iterable elements) which should return a negative, zero or positive number depending on whether the first argument is considered smaller than, equal to, or larger than the second argument*

*(source: https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#sorted)*

The greek alphabet is preloded for you as `greek_alphabet`:

```python
greek_alphabet = (
    'alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta', 'epsilon', 'zeta', 
    'eta', 'theta', 'iota', 'kappa', 'lambda', 'mu', 
    'nu', 'xi', 'omicron', 'pi', 'rho', 'sigma',
    'tau', 'upsilon', 'phi', 'chi', 'psi', 'omega')
```

## Examples

```python

greek_comparator('psi', 'psi')      == 0
greek_comparator('upsilon', 'rho')  >  0

Do you have in mind the good old TicTacToe?

Assuming that you get all the data in one array, you put a space around each value, `|` as a columns separator and multiple `-` as rows separator, with something like `[""O"", ""X"", "" "", "" "", ""X"", "" "", ""X"", ""O"", "" ""]` you should be returning this structure (inclusive of new lines):

```
 O | X |   
-----------
   | X |   
-----------
 X | O |   
```

Now, to spice up things a bit, we are going to expand our board well beyond a trivial `3` x `3` square and we will accept rectangles of big sizes, still all as a long linear array.

For example, for `""O"", ""X"", "" "", "" "", ""X"", "" "", ""X"", ""O"", "" "", ""O""]` (same as above, just one extra `""O""`) and knowing that the length of each row is `5`, you will be returning

```
 O | X |   |   | X 
-------------------
   | X | O |   | O 
```

And worry not about missing elements, as the array/list/vector length is always going to be a multiple of the width.

You will be given a fruit which a farmer has harvested, your job is to see if you should buy or sell.

You will be given 3 pairs of fruit. Your task is to trade your harvested fruit back into your harvested fruit via the intermediate pair, you should return a string of 3 actions.

if you have harvested apples, you would buy this fruit pair: apple_orange, if you have harvested oranges, you would sell that fruit pair.

(In other words, to go from left to right (apples to oranges) you buy, and to go from right to left you sell (oranges to apple))

e.g. 
apple_orange, orange_pear, apple_pear
1. if you have harvested apples, you would buy this fruit pair: apple_orange
2. Then you have oranges, so again you would buy this fruit pair: orange_pear
3. After you have pear, but now this time you would sell this fruit pair: apple_pear
4. Finally you are back with the apples

So your function would return a list: [“buy”,”buy”,”sell”]

Just another day in the world of Minecraft, Steve is getting ready to start his next exciting project -- building a railway system!

![Alt text](http://static.planetminecraft.com/files/resource_media/screenshot/1506/2015-02-02_0156508603066.jpg)

But first, Steve needs to melt some iron ores in the furnace to get the main building blocks of rails -- iron ingots. ![Alt text](http://www.blocksandgold.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/35x/cbcbef48e5e3bcce7c7ed908f20bc5b4/i/r/ironingot_icon32.png)

Each iron ingot takes 11 seconds* to produce. Steve needs a lot of them, and he has the following fuel options to add into the furnace: 

* Buckets of lava, each lasts 800 seconds* ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/items/bucketL.gif)
* Blaze rod, each lasts 120 seconds ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/items/blazerod.gif)
* Coals, each lasts 80 seconds ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/items/coal.gif)
* Blocks of Wood, each lasts 15 seconds ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/itemGifs/logs.gif)
* Sticks, each lasts 1 second* ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/items/stick.gif)

In Ruby:

To all the Minecraft players out there: 
feel free to expand this series or let me know if you have any ideas related to Minecraft that can be turned into codewars puzzles. Some ideas I have that might potentially be turned into katas:

* distance traveled in real world vs. in Nether
* shortest path problems related to mining diamonds/gold/goodies that appears in different levels under ground
* growth of animal population from breeding
* redstone stuff?!

If you do end up expanding this series, please send me a link of your kata so I can check it out and include a link to your kata here :-)

You are given a length of string and two thumbtacks. On thumbtack goes into the focus point *F₀* with coordinates *x₀* and *y₀*, and the other does into point *F₁* with points *x₁* and *y₁*. The string is then tied at the ends to the thumbtacks and has length *l* excluding the knots at the ends. If you pull the string taught with a pencil and draw around the plane you'll have an ellipse with focuses at *F₀* and *F₁*. Given a new point *P*, determine if it falls inside of the ellipse.

You must write a function that takes arguments `f0`, `f1`, `l`, and `p` and returns `true` or `false` depending on whether or not `p` falls inside the ellipse. 

Each of `f0`, `f1`, and `p` has has properties `x` and `y` for its coordinates.

You will never be given the case where the string is too short to reach between the points.

It's the fourth quater of the Super Bowl and your team is down by 4 points. You're 10 yards away from the endzone, if your team doesn't score a touchdown in the next four plays you lose. On a previous play, you were injured and rushed to the hospital. Your hospital room has no internet, tv, or radio and you don't know the results of the game. You look at your phone and see that on your way to the hospital a text message came in from one of your teamates. It contains an array of the last 4 plays in chronological order. In each play element of the array you will receive the yardage of the play and the type of the play. Have your function let you know if you won or not.

# What you know:

* Gaining greater than 10 yds from where you started is a touchdown and you win.
* Yardage of each play will always be a positive number greater than 0.
* There are only four types of plays: ""run"", ""pass"", ""sack"", ""turnover"".
* Type of plays that will gain yardage are: ""run"", ""pass"".
* Type of plays that will lose yardage are: ""sack"".
* Type of plays that will automatically lose the game are: ""turnover"".
* When a game ending play occurs the remaining (plays) arrays will be empty.
* If you win return true, if you lose return false.

# Examples:

[[8, ""pass""],[5, ""sack""],[3, ""sack""],[5, ""run""]]
`false`
[[12, ""pass""],[],[],[]])
`true`
[[2, ""run""],[5, ""pass""],[3, ""sack""],[8, ""pass""]]

Section numbers are strings of dot-separated integers. The highest level sections (chapters) are numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. Second level sections are numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, etc. Next level sections are numbered 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, erc. There is no bound on the number of sections a document may have, nor is there any bound on the number of levels. 

A section of a certain level may appear directly inside a section several levels higher without the levels between. For example, section 1.0.1 may appear directly under section 1, without there being any level 2 section. Section 1.1 comes after section 1.0.1. Sections with trailing "".0"" are considered to be the same as the section with the trailing "".0"" truncated. Thus, section 1.0 is the same as section 1, and section 1.2.0.0 is the same as section 1.2.

Welcome young Jedi! In this Kata you must create a function that takes an amount of US currency in `cents`, and returns a dictionary/hash which shows the least amount of coins used to make up that amount. The only coin denominations considered in this exercise are: `Pennies (1¢), Nickels (5¢), Dimes (10¢) and Quarters (25¢)`.
Therefor the dictionary returned should contain exactly 4 key/value pairs.

Notes:

* If the function is passed either 0 or a negative number, the function should return the dictionary with all values equal to 0.
* If a float is passed into the function, its value should be be rounded down, and the resulting dictionary should never contain fractions of a coin.

## Examples
```
loose_change(56)    ==>  {'Nickels': 1, 'Pennies': 1, 'Dimes': 0, 'Quarters': 2}
loose_change(-435)  ==>  {'Nickels': 0, 'Pennies': 0, 'Dimes': 0, 'Quarters': 0}

This is a follow-up from my previous Kata which can be found here: http://www.codewars.com/kata/5476f4ca03810c0fc0000098

This time, for any given linear sequence, calculate the function [f(x)] and return it as a function in Javascript or Lambda/Block in Ruby.

For example:

```python
get_function([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])(5) => 5
get_function([0, 3, 6, 9, 12])(10) => 30
get_function([1, 4, 7, 10, 13])(20) => 61
```

Assumptions for this kata are:
```
The sequence argument will always contain 5 values equal to f(0) - f(4).
The function will always be in the format ""nx +/- m"", 'x +/- m', 'nx', 'x' or 'm'
If a non-linear sequence simply return 'Non-linear sequence' for javascript, ruby, and python. For C#, throw an ArgumentException.

You need to write a function, that returns the first non-repeated character in the given string.

For example for string `""test""` function should return `'e'`.  
For string `""teeter""` function should return `'r'`.  

If a string contains all unique characters, then return just the first character of the string.  
Example: for input `""trend""` function should return `'t'`  

You can assume, that the input string has always non-zero length.

If there is no repeating character, return `null` in JS or Java, and `None` in Python.

Lot of junior developer can be stuck when they need to change the access permission to a file or a directory in an Unix-like operating systems.

To do that they can use the `chmod` command and with some magic trick they can change the permissionof a file or a directory. For more information about the `chmod` command you can take a look at the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod).

`chmod` provides two types of syntax that can be used for changing permissions. An absolute form using octal to denote which permissions bits are set e.g: 766.
Your goal in this kata is to define the octal you need to use in order to set yout permission correctly.

Here is the list of the permission you can set with the octal representation of this one.

- User
  - read (4)
  - write (2)
  - execute (1)
- Group
  - read (4)
  - write (2)
  - execute (1)
- Other
  - read (4)
  - write (2)
  - execute (1)

The method take a hash in argument this one can have a maximum of 3 keys (`owner`,`group`,`other`). Each key will have a 3 chars string to represent the permission, for example the string `rw-` say that the user want the permission `read`, `write` without the `execute`.
If a key is missing set the permission to `---`

**Note**: `chmod` allow you to set some special flags too (`setuid`, `setgid`, `sticky bit`) but to keep some simplicity for this kata we will ignore this one.

Write a function that takes a string and returns an array of the repeated characters (letters, numbers, whitespace) in the string.

If a charater is repeated more than once, only show it once in the result array.

Characters should be shown **by the order of their first repetition**. Note that this may be different from the order of first appearance of the character.

Characters are case sensitive.

# Task
Given array of integers `sequence` and some integer `fixedElement`, output the number of `even` values in sequence before the first occurrence of `fixedElement` or `-1` if and only if `fixedElement` is not contained in sequence.

# Input/Output

`[input]` integer array `sequence`

A non-empty array of positive integers.

`4 ≤ sequence.length ≤ 100`

`1 ≤ sequence[i] ≤ 9`

`[input]` integer `fixedElement`

An positive integer

`1 ≤ fixedElement ≤ 9`

`[output]` an integer

# Example

For `sequence = [1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 1] and fixedElement = 6`, the output should be `2`.

There are `2` even numbers before `6`: `4 and 2`

For `sequence = [2, 2, 2, 1] and fixedElement = 3`, the output should be `-1`.

There is no `3` appears in `sequence`. So returns `-1`.

For `sequence = [1, 3, 4, 3] and fixedElement = 3`, the output should be `0`.

`3` appears in `sequence`, but there is no even number before `3`.

`Description:`

Given an input array (`arr`) of positive integers, the objective is to return an output array where each index represents the amount of times an element appeared (frequency) in the input array. 

More specifically, the element at each index of the output array will be an array (bucket) containing integers that appeared index-amount-of-times. 

Otherwise, slot nulls (JavaScript, Java), None's (Python) nils (Ruby), or NULL's (C/C++) where appropriate. A valid array will always be provided.

If an array of [1,2,3,4,4,5,5,5] is passed in, the expected output should be: [null, [1,2,3], [4], [5], null, null, null, null, null].

`Explanation:`

```python
# bucketize(arr) ======> outputArray
bucketize(1,2,3,4,4,5,5,5) ======> [None, [1, 2, 3], [4], [5], None, None, None, None, None]
```

An element cannot appear 0 times, so a null is placed at outputArray[0]. The elements 1, 2, and 3 appear once. This is why they are located at outputArray[1]. Notice the elements are grouped together in an array and sorted in ascending order. The element 4 appears twice. This is why it is located at outputArray[2]. The element 5 appears three times. This is why it is located at outputArray[3]. 

Although an integer could have possibly appeared four, five, six, seven, or eight times, this is not the case for this particular example. This is the reason why the elements at outputArray[4], outputArray[5], outputArray[6], outputArray[7], and outputArray[8] are all null values.

`Examples:`

```python
bucketize(2,2,4,4,6,6,9,9,9,9) ==> [None, None, [2,4,6], None, [9], None, None, None, None, None, None]
bucketize(3,3,3,3,2) ============> [None, [2], None, None, [3], None]
bucketize(5,5,5,5,5) ============> [None, None, None, None, None, [5]]
bucketize(77,3,40,40,40) ========> [None, [3,77], None, [40], None, None]
bucketize(16,7,5,3,6,23) ========> [None, [3,5,6,7,16,23], None, None, None, None, None]

- on track
- challenge is completed

Examples:

`(12, 1, ""February"")` - should return `""You are on track.""`

`(12, 1, ""March"")` - should return `""You are 1 behind schedule.""`

`(12, 5, ""March"")` - should return `""You are 3 ahead of schedule.""`

`(12, 12, ""September"")` - should return `""Challenge is completed.""`

Details:
- you do not need to do any prechecks (input will always be a natural number and correct name of the month)
- months should be as even as possible (i.e. for 100 items: January, February, March and April - 9, other months 8)
- count only the item for completed months (i.e. for March check the values from January and February) and it means that for January you should always return `""You are on track.""`.

*SCHEDULE YOUR DA(RRA)Y*

The best way to have a productive day is to plan out your work schedule. Given the following three inputs, please create an an array of time alloted to work, broken up with time alloted with breaks:

Input 1: Hours - Number of hours available to you to get your work done! 
Input 2: Tasks - How many tasks you have to do througout the day
Input 3: Duration (minutes)- How long each of your tasks will take to complete
Criteria to bear in mind:
- Your schedule should start with work and end with work.
- It should also be in minutes, rounded to the nearest whole minute. 
- If your work is going to take more time than you have, return ""You're not sleeping tonight!""
Example:

```python
day_plan(8, 5, 30) == [ 30, 82, 30, 82, 30, 82, 30, 82, 30 ]

# Your task
Oh no... more lemmings!! And in Lemmings Planet a huge battle
is being fought between the two great rival races: the green
lemmings and the blue lemmings. Everybody was now assigned
to battle and they will fight until one of the races completely
dissapears: the Deadly War has begun!

Every single lemming has a power measure that describes its
ability to fight. When two single lemmings fight with each one,
the lemming with more power survives and the other one dies.
However, the power of the living lemming gets smaller after the
fight, exactly in the value of the power of the lemming that died.
For example, if we have a green lemming with power ``50`` and a
blue lemming with power ``40``, the blue one dies and the green one
survives, but having only power 10 after the battle ``(50-40=10)``.
If two lemmings have the same power when they fight, both of
them die.

In the fight between the two races, there are a certain number of battlefields. Each race assigns one
lemming for each battlefield, starting with the most powerful. So for example, if a race has 5 lemmings
with power ```{50, 50, 40, 40, 30}``` and we have `3` battlefields, then a lemming with power `50` will be assigned
to battlefield 1, another with `50` power will be assigned to battlefield 2 and last a lemming with power `40` will go to battlefield 3. The other race will do the same.

The Deadly War is processed by having each race send its best soldiers as described to the battle-
fields, making a battle round. Then, all battles process at the same time, and some of the lemmings
will emerge victorious (but with less power) and some of them will die. The surviving ones will return to their race’s army and then a new round will begin, with each race sending again its best remaining soldiers to the battlefields. If at some point a race does not have enough soldiers to fill all battlefields, then only the ones with soldiers from both races will have a fight.

The Deadly War ends when one of the races has no more lemmings or when both of them disappear
at the same time. For example, imagine a war with 2 battlefields and a green army with powers `{20,10}` and a blue army with powers `{10, 10, 15}`. The first round will have `20 vs 15` in battlefield 1 and `10 vs 10` in battlefield 2. After these battles, green race will still have a power `5` lemming (that won on battlefield 1) and blue race will have one with power 10 (that did not fight). The ones in battlefield 2
died, since they both had the same power. Afer that comes a second round, and only battlefield 1 will have a fight, being `5 vs 10`. The blue lemming wins, killing the last green soldier and giving the victory to the blue race!

But in the real battle, will victory be green or blue?

Given the number of battefields and the armies of both races, your task is to discover which race
will win the Deadly War and show the power of the surviving soldiers.

## Input

You are given B, SG and SB, representing respectively the number of battlefields available, a vector of integers size `n` of lemmings in the green army 
and a vector of integers size `n` of lemmings in the blue army  (1 ≤ B, SG, SB ≤ 100000).

The lemmings in each army do not need to come in any particular order.

## Output
For each test case you should return :

• ""Green and Blue died"" if both races died in the same round

• ""Green wins : Each surviving soldier in descending order"" if the green army won the Deadly War

• ""Blue wins : Each surviving soldier in descending order"" if the blue army won the Deadly War

## Example

```python
lemming_battle(5, [10], [10]) == ""Green and Blue died""
lemming_battle(2, [20,10], [10,10,15]) == ""Blue wins: 5""
lemming_battle(3, [50,40,30,40,50], [50,30,30,20,60]) == ""Green wins: 10 10""

Given a sequence of items and a specific item in that sequence, return the item immediately following the item specified. If the item occurs more than once in a sequence, return the item after the first occurence. This should work for a sequence of any type.

When the item isn't present or nothing follows it, the function should return nil in Clojure and Elixir, Nothing in Haskell, undefined in JavaScript, None in Python.

Sam is an avid collector of numbers. Every time he finds a new number he throws it on the top of his number-pile. Help Sam organise his collection so he can take it to the International Number Collectors Conference in Cologne. 

Given an array of numbers, your function should return an array of arrays, where each subarray contains all the duplicates of a particular number. Subarrays should be in the same order as the first occurence of the number they contain:
Assume the input is always going to be an array of numbers. If the input is an empty array, an empty array should be returned.

Write a function that outputs the transpose of a matrix - a new matrix
where the columns and rows of the original are swapped.

For example, the transpose of:

    | 1 2 3 |
    | 4 5 6 |

is

    | 1 4 |
    | 2 5 |
    | 3 6 |

The input to your function will be an array of matrix rows. You can
assume that each row has the same length, and that the height and
width of the matrix are both positive.

In this kata you need to write a function that will receive two strings (```n1``` and ```n2```), each representing an integer as a binary number. A third parameter will be provided (```o```) as a string representing one of the following operators: add, subtract, multiply.

Your task is to write the calculate function so that it will perform the arithmetic and the result returned should be a string representing the binary result.

Examples:
```
1 + 1 === 10
10 + 10 === 100
```

Negative binary numbers are usually preceded by several 1's. For this kata, negative numbers can be represented with the negative symbol at the beginning of the string.

Examples of negatives:
```
1 - 10 === -1
10 - 100 === -10
```

Math hasn't always been your best subject, and these programming symbols always trip you up!

I mean, does `**` mean *""Times, Times""* or *""To the power of""*?

Luckily, you can create the function `expression_out()` to write out the expressions for you!

The operators you'll need to use are:

```python
{ '+':   'Plus ',
  '-':   'Minus ',
  '*':   'Times ',
  '/':   'Divided By ',  
  '**':  'To The Power Of ',
  '=':   'Equals ',
  '!=':  'Does Not Equal ' }
```

These values will be stored in the preloaded dictionary `OPERATORS` just as shown above.

But keep in mind: INVALID operators will also be tested, to which you should return `""That's not an operator!""`

And all of the numbers will be `1` to`10`!
Isn't that nice!

Here's a few examples to clarify:

```python
expression_out(""4 ** 9"") == ""Four To The Power Of Nine""
expression_out(""10 - 5"") == ""Ten Minus Five""
expression_out(""2 = 2"")  == ""Two Equals Two""
```

Good luck!

You are the judge at a competitive eating competition and you need to choose a winner!

There are three foods at the competition and each type of food is worth a different amount of points.
Points are as follows:

- Chickenwings: 5 points  

- Hamburgers: 3 points   

- Hotdogs: 2 points

Write a function that helps you create a scoreboard. 
It takes as a parameter a list of objects representing the participants, for example:
```
[
  {name: ""Habanero Hillary"", chickenwings: 5 , hamburgers: 17, hotdogs: 11},
  {name: ""Big Bob"" , chickenwings: 20, hamburgers: 4, hotdogs: 11}

```
It should return 
""name"" and ""score"" properties sorted by score; if scores are equals, sort alphabetically by name.

  {name: ""Habanero Hillary"", score: 98}

# Task
Two players - `""black""` and `""white""` are playing a game. The game consists of several rounds. If a player wins in a round, he is to move again during the next round. If a player loses a round, it's the other player who moves on the next round. Given whose turn it was on the previous round and whether he won, determine whose turn it is on the next round.

# Input/Output

`[input]` string `lastPlayer`/`$last_player`

`""black""` or `""white""` - whose move it was during the previous round.

`[input]` boolean `win`/`$win`

`true` if the player who made a move during the previous round won, `false` otherwise.

`[output]` a string

Return `""white""` if white is to move on the next round, and `""black""` otherwise.

# Example

For `lastPlayer = ""black"" and win = false`, the output should be `""white""`.

For `lastPlayer = ""white"" and win = true`, the output should be `""white""`.

It's a Pokemon battle! Your task is to calculate the damage that a particular move would do using the following formula (not the actual one from the game):

Where:

* attack = your attack power
* defense = the opponent's defense
* effectiveness = the effectiveness of the attack based on the matchup (see explanation below)

Effectiveness:

Attacks can be super effective, neutral, or not very effective depending on the matchup. For example, water would be super effective against fire, but not very effective against grass.

* Super effective: 2x damage
* Neutral: 1x damage
* Not very effective: 0.5x damage

To prevent this kata from being tedious, you'll only be dealing with four types: `fire`, `water`, `grass`, and `electric`.  Here is the effectiveness of each matchup:

* `fire > grass`
* `fire < water`
* `fire = electric`

* `water < grass`
* `water < electric`

* `grass = electric`

For this kata, any type against itself is not very effective. Also, assume that the relationships between different types are symmetric (if `A` is super effective against `B`, then `B` is not very effective against `A`).

The function you must implement takes in:
1. your type
2. the opponent's type
3. your attack power
4. the opponent's defense

Your website is divided vertically in sections, and each can be of different size (height).  
You need to establish the section index (starting at `0`) you are at, given the `scrollY` and `sizes` of all sections.  
Sections start with `0`, so if first section is `200` high, it takes `0-199` ""pixels"" and second starts at `200`.

### Example:

`getSectionIdFromScroll( 300, [300,200,400,600,100] )`

will output number `1` as it's the second section.

`getSectionIdFromScroll( 1600, [300,200,400,600,100] )`

will output number `-1` as it's past last section.

Given the `scrollY` integer (always non-negative) and an array of non-negative integers (with at least one element), calculate the index (starting at `0`) or `-1` if `scrollY` falls beyond last section (indication of an error).

You will be given an array of positive integers. The array should be sorted by the amount of distinct perfect squares and reversed, that can be generated from each number permuting its digits.

E.g.: ```arr = [715, 112, 136, 169, 144]``` 
``` 
Number   Perfect Squares w/ its Digits   Amount
 715                -                       0
 112               121                      1
 136               361                      1
 169           169, 196, 961                3
 144             144, 441                   2
``` 
So the output will have the following order:
```[169, 144, 112, 136, 715]``` 

When we have two or more numbers with the same amount of perfect squares in their permutations, we sorted by their values.

In the example given above, we can see that 112 and 136 both generate a perfect square. So 112 comes first.

Examples for this kata:
```python
sort_by_perfsq([715, 112, 136, 169, 144]) == [169, 144, 112, 136, 715]
# number of perfect squares:                   3    2    1    1    0
``` 
We may have in the array numbers that belongs to the same set of permutations.
```python
sort_by_perfsq([234, 61, 16, 441, 144, 728]) == [144, 441, 16, 61, 234, 728]
# number of perfect squares:                      2    2    1   0   0    0
```

Features of the random tests:
~~~if:ruby,python
- Number of tests: 80
- Arrays between 4 and 20 elements
- Integers having from 1 to 7 digits included
~~~
~~~if:js
- Number of tests: 30
- Arrays between 4 and 16 elements

~~~

Enjoy it!!

Born a misinterpretation of [this kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-fun-number-334-two-beggars-and-gold/), your task here is pretty simple: given an array of values and an amount of beggars, you are supposed to return an array with the sum of what each beggar brings home, assuming they all take regular turns, from the first to the last.

For example: `[1,2,3,4,5]` for `2` beggars will return a result of `[9,6]`, as the first one takes `[1,3,5]`, the second collects `[2,4]`.

The same array with `3` beggars would have in turn have produced a better out come for the second beggar: `[5,7,3]`, as they will respectively take `[1,4]`, `[2,5]` and `[3]`.

Also note that not all beggars have to take the same amount of ""offers"", meaning that the length of the array is not necessarily a multiple of `n`; length can be even shorter, in which case the last beggars will of course take nothing (`0`).

***Note:*** in case you don't get why this kata is about *English* beggars, then you are not familiar on how religiously queues are taken in the kingdom ;)

In graph theory, a graph is a collection of nodes with connections between them.
Any node can be connected to any other node exactly once, and can be connected to no nodes, to some nodes, or to every other node.
Nodes cannot be connected to themselves
A path through a graph is a sequence of nodes, with every node connected to the node following and preceding it.
A closed path is a path which starts and ends at the same node.

An open path:
```
1 -> 2 -> 3
```
a closed path:
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1
```
A graph is connected if there is a path from every node to every other node.
A graph is a tree if it is connected and there are no closed paths.

Your job is to write a function 'isTree', which returns true if a graph is a tree, and false if it is not a tree.

Graphs will be given as an array with each item being an array of integers which are the nodes that node is connected to.

For example, this graph:
```
0--1
|  |
2--3--4
```
has array:
```
[[1,2], [0,3], [0,3], [1,2,4], [3]]
```
Note that it is also not a tree, because it contains closed path:
```
0->1->3->2->0
```
A node with no connections is an empty array
Note that if node 0 is connected to node 1, node 1 is also connected to node 0. This will always be true.
The order in which each connection is listed for each node also does not matter.

Good luck!

The aim of the kata is to decompose `n!` (factorial n) into its prime factors.

Examples:
```
n = 12; decomp(12) -> ""2^10 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7 * 11""
since 12! is divisible by 2 ten times, by 3 five times, by 5 two times and by 7 and 11 only once.

n = 22; decomp(22) -> ""2^19 * 3^9 * 5^4 * 7^3 * 11^2 * 13 * 17 * 19""

n = 25; decomp(25) -> 2^22 * 3^10 * 5^6 * 7^3 * 11^2 * 13 * 17 * 19 * 23
```

Prime numbers should be in increasing order. When the exponent of a prime is 1 don't put the exponent.

Notes

- the function is `decomp(n)` and should return the decomposition of `n!` into its prime factors in increasing order of the primes, as a string.
- factorial can be a very big number (`4000! has 12674 digits`, n will go from 300 to 4000).
- In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any redundant trailing whitespace: you can use `dynamically allocated character strings`.

A wildlife study involving ducks is taking place in North America. Researchers are visiting some wetlands in a certain area taking a survey of what they see. The researchers will submit reports that need to be processed by your function.

## Input

The input for your function will be an array with a list of common duck names along with the counts made by the researchers. The names and counts are separated by spaces in one array element. The number of spaces between the name and the count could vary; but, there will always be at least one. A name may be repeated because a report may be a combination of surveys from different locations.

An example of an input array would be:
```
[""Redhead 3"", ""Gadwall 1"", ""Smew 4"", ""Greater Scaup 10"", ""Redhead 3"", ""Gadwall 9"", ""Greater Scaup 15"", ""Common Eider 6""]
```

## Processing

Your function should change the names of the ducks to a six-letter code according to given rules (see below). The six-letter code should be in upper case. The counts should be summed for a species if it is repeated.

## Output

The final data to be returned from your function should be an array sorted by the species codes and the total counts as integers. The codes and the counts should be individual elements.

An example of an array to be returned (based on the example input array above) would be:
```
[""COMEID"", 6, ""GADWAL"", 10, ""GRESCA"", 25, ""REDHEA"", 6, ""SMEW"", 4]
```
The codes are strings in upper case and the totaled counts are integers.

### Special Note

If someone has `""Labrador Duck""` in their list, the whole list should be thrown out as this species has been determined to be extinct. The person who submitted the list is obviously unreliable. Their lists will not be included in the final data. In such cases, return an array with a single string element in it: `""Disqualified data""`

Rules for converting a common name to a six-letter code:

* Hyphens should be considered as spaces.
* If a name has only one word, use the first six letters of the name. If that name has less than six letters, use what is there.
* If a name has two words, take the first three letters of each word.
* If a name has three words, take the first two letters of each word.
* If a name has four words, take the first letters from the first two words, and the first two letters from the last two words.

`This kata is the first of the ADFGX Ciphers, the harder version can be found `here.

The ADFGX Cipher is a pretty well-known Cryptographic tool, and is essentially a modified Polybius Square.

Rather than having numbers as coordinates on the table, it has the letters:

 `A, D, F, G, X`

Also, because this is the first step, and to help simplify things, you won't have to worry about a key, or the corresponding columnar transposition. In this kata ;)

All you have to do is encrypt and decrypt a string into `ADFGX` format.

`adfgx_encrypt() and adfgx_decrypt()` will be passed a string, `plaintext` and `ciphertext` respectively, and an adfgx`square`, for which will guide the operations. 

Now for some examples to clear confusion:

```python
adfgx_encrypt(""helloworld"", ""bchigklnmoqprstuvwxyzadef"")

    A D F G X

A   b c h i g
D   k l n m o     
F   q p r s t  -> square (PLEASE NOTE, j SHOULD BE TREATED AS i)  
G   u v w x y  
X   z a d e f

""helloworld""   -> plaintext

EVALUATES TO:

      F  
          -> ""AF""
A     h
--------------
          G 
               -> ""XG""  
X         e 

AND SO FORTH...

#Results in:

adfgx_encrypt(""helloworld"", ""bchigklnmoqprstuvwxyzadef"") 
==
""AFXGDDDDDXGFDXFFDDXF""
```
Now decryption:
```python
adfgx_decrypt(""FGXGADGDXGFXAXXGFGFGAADGXG"", ""aczlmuqngoipvstkrwfxhdbey) 

    A D F G X

A   a c z l m
D   u q n g o     
F   i p v s t  -> square (PLEASE NOTE, j SHOULD BE TREATED AS i)  
G   k r w f x  
X   h d b e y

""FGXGADGDXGFXAXXGFGFGAADGXG""   -> ciphertext

""FG"" == ""s""
""XG"" == ""e""

In this kata, your task is to write a function `to_bytes(n)` (or `toBytes(n)` depending on language) that produces a list of bytes that represent a given non-negative integer `n`. Each byte in the list is represented by a string of `'0'` and `'1'` of length 8. The most significant byte is first in the list. The example test cases should provide you with all the details. You may assume that the argument `n` is valid.

In some countries of former Soviet Union there was a belief about lucky tickets. A transport ticket of any sort was believed to posess luck if sum of digits on the left half of its number was equal to the sum of digits on the right half. Here are examples of such numbers:
```
003111    #             3 = 1 + 1 + 1
813372    #     8 + 1 + 3 = 3 + 7 + 2
17935     #         1 + 7 = 3 + 5  // if the length is odd, you should ignore the middle number when adding the halves.
56328116  # 5 + 6 + 3 + 2 = 8 + 1 + 1 + 6
```
Such tickets were either eaten after being used or collected for bragging rights.

Your task is to write a funtion ```luck_check(str)```, which returns ```true/True``` if argument is string decimal representation of a lucky ticket number, or ```false/False``` for all other numbers. It should throw errors for empty strings or strings which don't represent a decimal number.

Your job is to figure out the index of which vowel is missing from a given string:

* `A` has an index of 0,
* `E` has an index of 1, 
* `I` has an index of 2, 
* `O` has an index of 3,
* `U` has an index of 4.

**Notes:** There is no need for string validation and every sentence given will contain all vowles but one. Also, you won't need to worry about capitals.

## Examples

""John Doe hs seven red pples under his bsket""          =>  0  ; missing: ""a""
""Bb Smith sent us six neatly arranged range bicycles""  =>  3  ; missing: ""o""

## The Riddle

The King of a small country invites 1000 senators to his annual party. As a tradition, each senator brings the King a bottle of wine. Soon after, the Queen discovers that one of the senators is trying to assassinate the King by giving him a bottle of poisoned wine. Unfortunately, they do not know which senator, nor which bottle of wine is poisoned, and the poison is completely indiscernible.

However, the King has 10 lab rats. He decides to use them as taste testers to determine which bottle of wine contains the poison. The poison when taken has no effect on the rats, until exactly 24 hours later when the infected rats suddenly die. The King needs to determine which bottle of wine is poisoned by tomorrow, so that the festivities can continue as planned.

Hence he only has time for one round of testing, he decides that each rat tastes multiple bottles, according to a certain scheme.

## Your Task

You receive an array of integers (`0 to 9`), each of them is the number of a rat which died after tasting the wine bottles. Return the number of the bottle (`1..1000`) which is poisoned.

**Good Luck!**

*Hint: think of rats as a certain representation of the number of the bottle...*

We have the numbers with different colours with the sequence: ['red', 'yellow', 'blue'].

That sequence colours the numbers in the following way:

 1   2   3    4    5   6  7   8   9   10   11  12   13 .....

We have got the following recursive function:

  ```
f(1) = 1
f(n) = f(n - 1) + n
```

Some terms of this sequence with their corresponding colour are:

```
term   value   colour
1        1     ""red""
2        3     ""blue""
3        6     ""blue""
4       10     ""red""
5       15     ""blue""
6       21     ""blue""
7       28     ""red""
```

The three terms of the same colour ""blue"", higher than 3, are: `[6, 15, 21]`

We need a function `same_col_seq(), that may receive three arguments:

- `val`, an integer number
- `k`, an integer number
- `colour`, the name of one of the three colours(red, yellow or blue), as a string.

The function will output a sorted array with the smallest `k` terms, having the same marked colour, but higher than `val`.

Let's see some examples:

```python
same_col_seq(3, 3, 'blue') == [6, 15, 21]
same_col_seq(100, 4, 'red') == [136, 190, 253, 325]
```

The function may output an empty list if it does not find terms of the sequence with the wanted colour in the range [val, 2* k * val]

```python
same_col_seq(250, 6, 'yellow') == []
```

That means that the function did not find any ""yellow"" term in the range `[250, 3000]`

Tests will be with the following features:

* Nmber of tests: `100`
* `100 < val < 1000000`
* `3 < k < 20`

Given a standard english sentence passed in as a string, write a method that will return a sentence made up of the same words, but sorted by their first letter. However, the method of sorting has a twist to it:
* All words that begin with a lower case letter should be at the beginning of the sorted sentence, and sorted in ascending order.
* All words that begin with an upper case letter should come after that, and should be sorted in descending order.

If a word appears multiple times in the sentence, it should be returned multiple times in the sorted sentence. Any punctuation must be discarded.

## Example

For example, given the input string `""Land of the Old Thirteen! Massachusetts land! land of Vermont and Connecticut!""`, your method should return `""and land land of of the Vermont Thirteen Old Massachusetts Land Connecticut""`. Lower case letters are sorted `a -> l -> l -> o -> o -> t` and upper case letters are sorted `V -> T -> O -> M -> L -> C`.

Hi! Welcome to my first kata.

In this kata the task is to take a list of integers (positive and negative) and split them according to a simple rule; those ints greater than or equal to the key, and those ints less than the key (the itself key will always be positive).

However, in this kata the goal is to sort the numbers IN PLACE, so DON'T go messing around with the order in with the numbers appear.

You are to return a nested list. If the list is empty, simply return an empty list.

Confused? Okay, let me walk you through an example...

    The input is: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 10, 5, 10], the key is: 6
Okay so the first five numbers are less than the key, 6, so we group them together.

    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
The next two numbers, 6 & 10, are both >= 6 to they belong in a seperate group, which we will add to the first group. Like so:

    [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [6, 10]]
The next two numbers are 5 & 10. Since the key is 6 these two numbers form seperate groups, which we will add to the previous result. like so:

    [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [6, 10], [5], [10]]
And voila! We're done.

Here are a few more basic examples:

    group_ints([1, 0], key= 0)  
    --> [[1,0]]

    group_ints([1, 0, -1, 5], key= 0) 
    --> [[1, 0], [-1], [5]]

    group_ints([1, 0, -1, 5], key= 5) 
    --> [[1, 0, -1], [5]]

Good luck guys/gals!

Let's just place tokens on a connect four board.

** INPUT **

Provided as input the list of columns where a token is placed, from 0 to 6 included.
The first player starting is the yellow one (marked with `Y`), then the red (marked with `R`); the other cells might be empty and marked with `-`.

** OUTPUT **

The output is the state of the board after all the tokens in input have been placed.

** ASSUMPTIONS **

- The board is the standard 7x6;
- Of course you'll need to deal with gravity;
- You don't need to hassle with wrong input, wrong column numbers, checking for full column or going off the board;
- the columns list will always include proper column numbers;
- Notice: when you read the results in tests, the highest row appears first and the lowest row appears last; debugging using `\n` after each row might help (check example);

** EXAMPLES **

1.
```
Moves = [0,1,2,5,6]

Result:
['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']
['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']
['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']
['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']
['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']
['Y', 'R', 'Y', '-', '-', 'R', 'Y']
```
2.
```
Moves = [0,1,2,5,6,2,0,0]

Result:
['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']
['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']
['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']
['R', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-']
['Y', '-', 'R', '-', '-', '-', '-']
['Y', 'R', 'Y', '-', '-', 'R', 'Y']
```

A [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) is a binary tree that is ordered. This means that if you were to convert the tree to an array using an in-order traversal, the array would be in sorted order. The benefit gained by this ordering is that when the tree is balanced, searching is a logarithmic time operation, since each node you look at that isn't the one you're searching for lets you discard half of the tree.

If you haven't worked with binary trees before or don't understand what a traversal is, you can learn more about that here: https://www.codewars.com/kata/binary-tree-traversal.

In this kata, you will write a function that will validate that a given binary tree is a binary search tree. The sort order is not predefined so it should work with either.

These are valid binary search trees:

        5
       / \
      2   7
     / \   \
    1   3   9

      7
     / \
    9   2

while these are not:

      1
     / \
    2   3

      5
     / \
    2   9
     \
      7

There are several different approaches you can take to solve this kata. If you're not as comfortable with recursion I'd recommend practicing that.

Note: no test case tree will contain duplicate numbers.

This kata is about singly 
linked list.  A linked list is an ordered set of data elements, each containing a link to its successor (and sometimes its predecessor, known as a double linked list).  You are you to implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element.

For example given a linked list of:
a -> b -> c -> d

if k is the number one then d should be returned
if k is the number two then c should be returned
if k is the number three then b should be returned
if k is the number four then a should be returned
if k exceeds the size of the list then None returned

Special Note --> Node classes contain two fields; data and next.
And to access the head of the list, use head. e.g. linked_list.head

A company is opening a bank, but the coder who is designing the user class made some errors. They need  you  to help them. 

You must include the following:

- A withdraw method
  - Subtracts money from balance
  - One parameter, money to withdraw
  - Raise ValueError if there isn't enough money to withdraw
  - Return a string with name and balence(see examples)

* A check method
  - Adds money to baleance
  - Two parameters, other user and money
  - Other user will always be valid
  - Raise a ValueError if other user doesn't have enough money
  - Raise a ValueError if checking_account isn't true for other user
  - Return a string with name and balance plus other name and other balance(see examples)

- An add_cash method
  - Adds money to balance
  - One parameter, money to add
  - Return a string with name and balance(see examples)

Additional Notes:
  * Checking_account should be stored as a boolean
  - No input numbers will be negitive
  * Output must end with period
  - Float numbers will not be used so, balance should be integer
  * No currency will be used

Examples:
``` Python
Jeff = User('Jeff', 70, True)
Joe = User('Joe', 70, False)

Jeff.withdraw(2) # Returns 'Jeff has 68.'

Joe.check(Jeff, 50) # Returns 'Joe has 120 and Jeff has 18.'

Jeff.check(Joe, 80) # Raises a ValueError

Joe.checking_account = True # Enables checking for Joe

Jeff.check(Joe, 80) # Returns 'Jeff has 98 and Joe has 40'

Joe.check(Jeff, 100) # Raises a ValueError

Jeff.add_cash(20.00) # Returns 'Jeff has 118.'
```

The 26 letters of the English alphabets are randomly divided into 5 groups of 5 letters with the remaining letter being ignored.  Each of the group is assigned a score of more than 0.  The ignored letter always has a score of 0.

With this kata, write a function ```nameScore(name)``` to work out the score of a name that is passed to the function.

The output should be returned as an object:

Only letters have a score. Spaces do not.

You can safely assume that ```name``` does not contain any punctuations or symbols.  There will also be no ```empty string``` or ```null``` value.

A static ```alpha``` object for testing has been preloaded  for your convenience in the following format:

Note that the ```alpha``` object will be randomly generated each time you run the test.

#Example

In accordance to the above ```alpha``` object, the name ```Mary Jane``` will have a name score of ```20``` => M=3 + a=1 + r=4 + y=5 + J=2 + a=1 + n=3 + e=1

You're going on a trip with some students and it's up to you to keep track of how much money each Student has. A student is defined like this:

        self.tens = tens
        self.twenties = twenties
```

As you can tell, each Student has some fives, tens, and twenties. Your job is to return the name of the student with the most money. If every student has the same amount, then return `""all""`.

My tired eyes surveyed the horizon to spot a right triangle, made of an unknown material that sparkles in the endless void I have trekked thus far.

I hurried towards it. However far it seemed, it can't compare to the uncounted days I have been trapped here in this endless void. To break the monotony, it shall do nicely.

Reaching the triangle, I inspected it. It is even more spectacular up close than a far, like a piece of the heavens, just as grand as the best Hubble photo I've ever seen. Adorned onto its striking surface were two numbers, each hugging a side of the triangle in white chalk.

```python
{'a': 3, 'b': 4}
```

Almost unconsciously, I grabbed at the misshapen chalk piece in my pocket, a small stone shaped calcium oddity I found among the void. I am hit with the sudden urge to write on the cosmic shape, to complete the numbers by filling in the missing side. The shear burning desire scares me, but I did it anyway. With a bit of internal head math, I wrote down my solution.

```python
{'a': 3, 'b': 4, 'c': 5}
```

The triangle glowed white, contrasting almost blindingly against the surrounding darkness around me. Could it be, that solving this shape would be my salvation, my escape from this dark and empty place?

I stared at the shining geometry for what felt like ever, before, with a disappointed sigh, I glanced away from the mesmerizing false hope. Only to catch the sight of two more triangles of right angles.

```python
{'a': 5, 'c': 13}
{'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

Somehow, I knew the third triangle had its first side unmarked, rather than its second, I'll have to take that into account were I to do this right. I idly solved them both, looking on in wonder as they too turned white.

```python
{'a': 5, 'b': 12, 'c': 13}
{'a': 2.236, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

Something on the edge of my peripheral vision moved. I looked up, to be greeted with hundreds of right triangles, like angels from the heavens, coming down right at me.

I might need a better solution to turn them all shining white...

# Background

A spider web is defined by

* ""rings"" numbered out from the centre as `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`

* ""radials"" labelled clock-wise from the top as `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `H`

Here is a picture to help explain:

# Web Coordinates

As you can see, each point where the rings and the radials intersect can be described by a ""web coordinate"".

So in this example the spider is at `H3` and the fly is at `E2`

# Kata Task

Our friendly jumping spider is resting and minding his own spidery business at web-coordinate `spider`.

An inattentive fly bumbles into the web at web-coordinate `fly` and gets itself stuck.

Your task is to calculate and return **the 
 distance** the spider must jump to get to the fly.

# Example

The solution to the scenario described by the picture is ``4.63522``

# Notes

* The centre of the web will always be referred to as `A0` 
* The rings intersect the radials at **evenly** spaced distances of **1 unit**

# An introduction to propositional logic

Logic and proof theory are fields that study the formalization of logical statements and the structure of valid proofs. One of the most common ways to represent logical reasonings is with **propositional logic**.

A propositional formula is no more than what you normally use in your *if statements*, but without functions or predicates. The basic unit for these formulas are **literals**. Let's see some examples:

```
f = p ∧ q
```

Here ```p``` and ```q``` would be the literals. This formula means that *f* evaluates to ```True``` only when both ```p``` **and** ```q``` are True too. The ```∧``` operator is formally called **conjunction** and is often called **and**.

```
f = p ∨ q
```

This formula means that *f* evaluates to ```True``` only when any of ```p``` **or** ```q``` are  True. This includes the case when both are True. The ```∨``` operator is formally called **disjunction** and is often called **or**.

```
f = ¬p
```

The ```¬``` operator is analogous to the **not** operation. it evaluates to True only when its argument evaluates to False.

Normally, there are also two other operators called **implication** and **biconditional**, but we will ignore them for this kata (they can be expressed in terms of the other three anyways).

Once we know this, can construct what is called an **interpretation** in order to evaluate a propositional formula. This is a fancy name for any structure that tells us which literals are False and which ones are True. Normally, interpretations are given as a set:

```python
p = Literal('p')
q = Literal('q')
r = Literal('r')

f = p ∨ q ∨ ¬r

i_1 = {p, q} # p and q are True, r is False
i_2 = {r}    # r is True, p and q are False
i_3 = {}     # p, q and r are False

# Note: the 'evaluate' function is not given
evaluate(f, i_1) == True
evaluate(f, i_2) == False
evaluate(f, i_3) == True
```

As you can see, if the literal is in the set, we say it evaluates to True, else it is False.

As a final note, an interpretation that makes a formula True is called a **model** when all the literals in the set appear in the formula.

# The SAT problem

This is a famous NP problem that is stated as follows:

> Given a propositional formula *F*, does it exist an interpretation such that it evaluates to True? (i.e. is *F* **satisfiable**?)

Numerous algorithms exist for this purpose, and your task is to program one of them. Right now, you are not supposed to program an efficient algorithm, but I may create a performance version if this kata gets good reception :)

# Specification

Program a ```sat(f: Formula)``` function that returns the following:
- ```False``` if ```f``` is not satisfiable.
- An interpretation that makes ```f``` evaluate to True in the case that it is satisfiable.

# Preloaded code

You are given a class ```Formula``` that has the following members:

- ```args```: arguments of the operation if the formula is not a literal (children nodes of the formula's tree). They are given as a list of Formula objects that has one element in the case of the negation operator and two or more elements in the case of the conjunction and disjunction operators.
- ```is_literal()```: True if the formula is a literal (i.e. not an operation).
- ```is_and()```: True if the formula is a **conjunction**.
- ```is_or()```: True if the formula is a **disjunction**. 
- ```is_not()```: True if the formula is a **negation**. 

You are also given a class ```Literal``` that extends from ```Formula``` and has the following members:

- ```name```: string that represents the literal. Two literals with the same name **are the same literal**.
*Note: the rest of members are not guaranteed in the case of a literal*

The ```&``` operator is overloaded as the conjunction, ```|``` as the disjunction and ```~``` as the negation. Also, a ```__repr__``` function is given for debugging purposes.

# Extra examples

```
f = ¬(p ∨ q) # Satisfiable with {}
```
```
f = ¬(p ∧ q) # Satisfiable with {p}, {q} and {}
```
```
f = p ∧ (q ∨ r) # Satisfiable with {p, q}, {p, r} and {p, q, r}
```
```
f = ¬p ∨ ¬q # Satisfiable with {p}, {q} and {} (See De Morgan's Laws)
```
```
f = p ∧ ¬p # Not satisfiable
```

Linked Lists - Get Nth

Implement a GetNth() function that takes a linked list and an integer index and returns the node stored at the Nth index position. GetNth() uses the C numbering convention that the first node is index 0, the second is index 1, ... and so on. So for the list 42 -> 13 -> 666, GetNth() with index 1 should return Node(13);

The index should be in the range [0..length-1]. If it is not, GetNth() should throw/raise an exception (`ArgumentException` in C#, `InvalidArgumentException` in PHP). You should also raise an exception (`ArgumentException` in C#, `InvalidArgumentException` in PHP) if the list is empty/null/None.

Prerequisite Kata (may be in beta):

- Linked Lists - Push & BuildOneTwoThree
- Linked Lists - Length & Count

> The push() and buildOneTwoThree() (`BuildOneTwoThree` in C#, `build_one_two_three()` in PHP) functions do not need to be redefined.

# Task
Follow the instructions in each failing test case to write logic that calculates the total price when ringing items up at a cash register.

# Purpose
Practice writing maintainable and extendable code. 

# Intent
This kata is meant to emulate the real world where requirements change over time. This kata does not provide a specification for the final end-state up front. Instead, it walks you through a series of requirements, modifying and extending them via test cases as you go. This kata is about the journey, not the destination. Your ability to write maintainable and extendable code will affect how difficult this kata is. 

# Provided Utility Function
You may use the following preloaded function:
```python
get_price(item)
""""""Accepts a str specifying an item. Returns the price of
the item (float) or raises a KeyError if no price is available.

Example: 

    >>> get_price(apple)
    0.4
""""""
```

The [Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator) is one of the oldest pseudo random number generator functions.

The algorithm is as follows:

## Xn+1=(aXn + c) mod m
where:
* `a`/`A` is the multiplier (we'll be using `2`)
* `c`/`C` is the increment (we'll be using `3`)
* `m`/`M` is the modulus (we'll be using `10`)

X0 is the seed.

# Your task

Define a method `random`/`Random` in the class `LCG` that provides the next random number based on a seed. You never return the initial seed value.

Similar to [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.random) return the result as a floating point number in the range `[0.0, 1.0)`

# Example

```python
# initialize the generator with seed = 5
LCG(5)

# first random number (seed = 5)
LCG.random() = 0.3      # (2 * 5 + 3) mod 10 = 3 --> return 0.3

# next random number (seed = 3)
LCG.random() = 0.9      # (2 * 3 + 3) mod 10 = 9 --> return 0.9

# next random number (seed = 9)
LCG.random() = 0.1

# next random number (seed = 1)
LCG.random() = 0.5

# Idea

In the world of graphs exists a structure called ""spanning tree"". It is unique because it's created not on its own, but based on other graphs. To make a spanning tree out of a given graph you should remove all the edges which create cycles, for example:
```
This can become      this      or      this        or       this

 A                    A                  A                   A
 |\                   |                   \                  |\
 | \       ==>        |                    \                 | \
 |__\                 |__                 __\                |  \
B   C                 B  C               B  C                B  C
```
Each *edge* (line between 2 *vertices*, i.e. points) has a weight, based on which you can build minimum and maximum spanning trees (sum of weights of vertices in the resulting tree is minimal/maximal possible).  
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree) on spanning trees, in case you need it.

___

# Task

You will receive an array like this: `[[""AB"", 2], [""BC"", 4], [""AC"", 1]]` which includes all edges of an arbitrary graph and a string `""min""`/`""max""`. Based on them you should get and return a new array which includes only those edges which form a minimum/maximum spanning trees.
```python
edges = [(""AB"", 2), (""BC"", 4), (""AC"", 1)]

make_spanning_tree(edges, ""min"")    ==>    [(""AB"", 2), (""AC"", 1)]
make_spanning_tree(edges, ""max"")    ==>    [(""AB"", 2), (""BC"", 4)]
```

# Notes

* All vertices will be connected with each other
* You may receive cycles, for example - `[""AA"", n]`
* The subject of the test are these 3 values: number of vertices included, total weight, number of edges, but **you should not return them**, there's a special function which will analyze your output instead

Create a `Vector` class with `x` and a `y` attributes that represent component magnitudes in the x and y directions.

Your vectors should handle vector additon with an `.add()` method that takes a second vector as an argument and returns a new vector equal to the sum of the vector you call `.add()` on and the vector you pass in.

For example:

```python
>>> a = Vector(3, 4)
>>> a.x
3
>>> a.y
4
>>> b = Vector(1, 2)
>>> c = a.add(b)
>>> c.x
4
>>> c.y
6
```

Adding vectors when you have their components is easy: just add the two x components together and the two y components together to get the x and y components for the vector sum.

# Magpies are my favourite birds

Baby ones even more so...

It is a little known fact^ that the black & white colours of baby magpies differ by **at least** one place and **at most** two places from the colours of the mother magpie.

So now you can work out if any two magpies may be related. 

*...and Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle the magpies said*

# Kata Task

Given the colours of two magpies, determine if one is a possible **child** or **grand-child** of the other.

# Notes

* Each pair of birds being compared will have same number of colour areas
* `B` = Black
* `W` = White

# Example

Given these three magpies

Magpie 1  BWBWBW
Magpie 2  BWBWBB
Magpie 3  WWWWBB

You can see:
* Magpie 2 may be a child of Magpie 1 because there is only one difference
* Magpie 3 may be child of Magpie 2 because there are two differences
* So Magpie 3 may be a grand-child of Magpie 1
* On the other hand, Magpie 3 cannot be a child of Magpie 1 because there are three differences

When you were little, your mother used to make the most delicious cookies, which you could not resist. So, every now and then, when your mother didn't see you, you sneaked into the kitchen, climbed onto a stool to reach the cookie jar, and stole a cookie or two. However, sometimes while doing this, you would hear foot steps approaching, so you quickly jumped down from the stool and, when your mother entered the kitchen, you pretended as if nothing had happened (whistle, whistle innocently). However, your mother knew. How did she know? You forgot to put the lid back on the cookie jar! Oh, no!

Growing older (and still not able to resist your mother's cookies), you deviced a contraption that would automatically put the lid back on the cookie jar, _no matter what would happen_.

The class `CookieJar` is provided: 
```Python
class CookieJar(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self._is_open = False

    def take(self):
        if not self._is_open:

Your task is to implement the 'contraption' `SelfClosing` (class, method, whatever; it's your choice) such that, given an instance`cookie_jar` of `CookieJar`, you may call:

```Python
with SelfClosing(cookie_jar) as jar:
    cookie = jar.take()
```
after which, `cookie_jar.is_open() == False`, _no matter what_.

Do not alter the provided code. (Tests will be performed with a code that differs slightly from the one provided, so modifying it is to no avail.)

Enjoy!

Classy Extensions
Classy Extensions, this kata is mainly aimed at the new JS ES6 Update introducing extends keyword. You will be preloaded with the Animal class, so you should only edit the Cat class.

Task
Your task is to complete the Cat class which Extends Animal and replace the speak method to return the cats name + meows.
e.g. 'Mr Whiskers meows.'

The name attribute is passed with this.name (JS), @name (Ruby) or self.name (Python).

John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He's heard that 
making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds. 
He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.

John knows that the rectangular room has a length of `l` meters, a width of `w` meters, a height of `h` meters.
The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is `52` centimeters. The 
length of a roll is `10` meters.
He bears in mind however, that it’s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length `15%` greater than the one he needs.

Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John? Your function `wallpaper(l, w, h)` should return as a plain English word
in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

### Example:

`wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return ""ten""`

`wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return ""zero""`

# Notes:
- all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge 
- 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that `w x h x l` is zero
- the integer `r` (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20

- FORTH: the number of rolls will be a *positive or null integer* (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)
-/",,,"def wallpaper (l w h : Float) : NumberWord := sorry

We have a distribution of probability of a discrete variable (it may have only integer values)
```
x       P(x)
0       0.125
1       0.375
2       0.375
3       0.125
Total = 1.000   # The sum of the probabilities for all the possible values should be one (=1)
```
The mean, ```μ```,  of the values of x is:

For our example
```
μ = 0*0.125 + 1*0.375 + 2*0.375 + 3*0.125 = 1.5
```

The variance, ```σ²``` is:

For our example :
```
σ² = 0.75
```

The standard deviation, ```σ``` is:

Finally, for our example:
```
σ = 0.8660254037844386
```
Make the function ```stats_disc_distr()``` that receives a 2D array. Each internal array will have a pair of values: the first one, the value of the variable ```x``` and the second one its correspondent probability, ```P(x)```.

For the example given above:
```python
stats_disc_distr([[0, 0.125], [1, 0.375], [2, 0.375], [3, 0.125]]) == [1.5, 0.75, 0.8660254037844386]
```
The function should check also if it is a valid distribution.

If the sum of the probabilities is different than ```1```, the function should output an alert.
```python
stats_disc_distr([[0, 0.425], [1, 0.375], [2, 0.375], [3, 0.125]]) == ""It's not a valid distribution""
```
If one of the values of ```x``` is not an integer, the function will give a specific alert:
```python
stats_disc_distr([[0.1, 0.425], [1.1, 0.375], [2, 0.375], [3, 0.125]]) == ""All the variable values should be integers""
```

If the distribution has both problems will output another specific alert:
```python
stats_disc_distr([[0.1, 0.425], [1.1, 0.375], [2, 0.375], [3, 0.125]]) == ""It's not a valid distribution and furthermore, one or more variable value are not integers""
```
But if a value is a float with its decimal part equals to 0 will proceed without inconveniences, (if the sum of probabilities is ```1```:
```python
stats_disc_distr([[0.0, 0.125], [1.0, 0.375], [2.0, 0.375], [3, 0.125]]) == [1.5, 0.75, 0.8660254037844386]
```

The 2Darray will not have any strings.

Enjoy it!!

John and Mary want to travel between a few towns A, B, C ... Mary has on a sheet of paper a list of distances between these towns.
`ls = [50, 55, 57, 58, 60]`.
John is tired of driving and he says to Mary that he doesn't want to drive more than `t = 174 miles` and he
will visit only `3` towns.

Which distances, hence which towns, they will choose so that the sum of the distances is the biggest possible to please Mary and John?

Example: 

With list `ls` and 3 towns to visit they can make a choice between: 
`[50,55,57],[50,55,58],[50,55,60],[50,57,58],[50,57,60],[50,58,60],[55,57,58],[55,57,60],[55,58,60],[57,58,60]`.

The sums of distances are then:
`162, 163, 165, 165, 167, 168, 170, 172, 173, 175`.

The biggest possible sum taking a limit of `174` into account is then `173` and the distances of the `3` 
corresponding towns is `[55, 58, 60]`.

The function `chooseBestSum` (or `choose_best_sum` or ... depending on the language) will take as parameters `t` (maximum sum of distances, integer >= 0), `k` (number of towns to visit, k >= 1) 
and `ls` (list of distances, all distances are positive or null integers and this list has at least one element).
The function returns the ""best"" sum ie the biggest possible sum of `k` distances less than or equal to the given limit `t`, if that sum exists,
or otherwise nil, null, None, Nothing, depending on the language. With C++, C, Rust, Swift, Go, Kotlin return `-1`.

Examples: 

`ts = [50, 55, 56, 57, 58]`
`choose_best_sum(163, 3, ts) -> 163`

`xs = [50]`
`choose_best_sum(163, 3, xs) -> nil (or null or ... or -1 (C++, C, Rust, Swift, Go)`

`ys = [91, 74, 73, 85, 73, 81, 87]`
`choose_best_sum(230, 3, ys) -> 228`

## Description

Welcome, Warrior! In this kata, you will get a message and you will need to get the frequency of each and every character!

## Explanation

Your function will be called `char_freq`/`charFreq`/`CharFreq` and you will get passed a string, you will then return a dictionary (object in JavaScript) with as keys the characters, and as values how many times that character is in the string. You can assume you will be given valid input. 

## Example

```python
char_freq(""I like cats"") // Returns {'a': 1, ' ': 2, 'c': 1, 'e': 1, 'I': 1, 'k': 1, 'l': 1, 'i': 1, 's': 1, 't': 1}

Quite recently it happened to me to join some recruitment interview, where my first task was to write own implementation of built-in split function. It's quite simple, is it not?

However, there were the following conditions:

* the function **cannot** use, in any way, the original `split` or `rsplit` functions,
* the new function **must** be a generator,
* it should behave as the built-in `split`, so it will be tested that way -- think of `split()` and `split('')`

*This Kata will control if the new function is a generator and if it's not using the built-in split method, so you may try to hack it, but let me know if with success, or if something would go wrong!*

Enjoy!

A circle is defined by three coplanar points that are not aligned.

You will be given a list of circles and a point [xP, yP]. You have to create a function, ```count_circles()``` (Javascript ```countCircles()```), that will count the amount of circles that contains the point P inside (the circle border line is included).

```python
list_of_circles = ([[[-3,2], [1,1], [6,4]], [[-3,2], [1,1], [2,6]], [[1,1], [2,6], [6,4]], [[[-3,2],[2,6], [6,4]]]

point1 = [1, 4] # P1
count_circles(list_of_circles, point1) == 4 #(The four circles have P1 inside)
```

It may happen that the point may be external to all the circles.

```python
list_of_circles = ([[[-3,2], [1,1], [6,4]], [[-3,2], [1,1], [2,6]], [[1,1], [2,6], [6,4]], [[-3,2],[2,6], [6,4]]]

point2 = [10, 6] # P2
count_circles(list_of_circles, point2) == 0 #(P2 is exterior to the four circles)
```
The point may be in the circle line and that will be consider as an internal point of it, too. 
For practical purposes a given point ```P``` will be in the circle line if: 
         |r - d|/r < 10^(-10)

```r```: radius of the circle that should be calculated from the coordinates of the three given points.

```d```: distance from the point ```P``` to the center of the circle. Again we have to do a calculation, the coordinates of the center should be calculated using the coordinates of the three given points.

Let's see a case when the pints is in the circle line.

```python
list_of_circles = ([[[-3,2], [1,1], [6,4]], [[-3,2], [1,1], [2,6]], [[1,1], [2,6], [6,4]], [[[-3,2],[2,6], [6,4]]]

point3 = point2 = [2, 6] # P3
count_circles(list_of_circles, point3) == 4 #(P3  is an internal point of the four circles)
```

All these three cases are shown in the image below:

Your code should be able to skip these cases:

- inexistent circle when we have three points aligned

- undefined circles when two or three of given points coincides.

First ten people to solve it will receive extra points.

Hints: This kata will give you important formulas: ```Give The Center And The Radius of Circumscribed Circle. (A warm up challenge)```

The special score(ssc) of an array of integers will be the sum of each integer multiplied by its corresponding index plus one in the array.

E.g.: with the array  ```[6, 12, -1]```
```
arr =   [6,      12,       -1 ]
ssc =   1*6  +  2* 12 +  3.(*1) = 6 + 24 - 3 = 27
```
The array given in the example has six(6) permutations and are with the corresponding ssc:
```
Permutations      Special Score (ssc)
[6, 12, -1]      1*6 + 2*12 + 3*(-1) = 27
[6, -1, 12]       1*6 + 2*(-1) + 3*12 = 40
[-1, 6, 12]       1*(-1) + 2*6 + 3*12 = 47
[-1, 12, 6]       1*(-1) + 2*12 + 3*6 = 41
[12, -1, 6]       1*12 + 2*(-1) + 3*6 = 28
[12, 6, -1]       1*12 + 2*6 + 3*(-1) = 21
```
The total sum of the ```ssc's``` of all the possible permutations is: ```27 + 40 + 47 + 41 + 28 + 21 = 204```

The maximum value for the ```ssc``` is ```47```.

The minimum value for the ```ssc``` is ```21```.

We need a special function ```ssc_forperm()``` that receives an array of uncertain number of elements (the elements may occur more than once) and may output a list of dictionaries with the following data:
```
[{""total perm"":__}, {""total ssc"": ___}, {""max ssc"": __}, {""min ssc"": __}]
```
For the example we have above will be:
```python
ssc_forperm([6, 12, -1]) = [{""total perm"":6}, {""total ssc:204}, {""max ssc"":47}, {""min ssc"":21}]
```
You may assume that you will never receive an empty array.

Also you will never receive an array with the same element in all the positions like [1, 1, 1, 1 ,1], but you may have elements occuring twice or more like [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]

Enjoy it!!

#Split all even numbers to odd ones in different ways

Your task is to split all even numbers from an array to odd ones. So your method has to return a new array with only odd numbers.

For ""splitting"" the numbers there are four ways.

```
0 -> Split into two odd numbers, that are closest to each other.
     (e.g.: 8 -> 3,5)
1 -> Split into two odd numbers, that are most far from each other.
     (e.g.: 8 -> 1,7)
2 -> All new odd numbers from the splitting should be equal and the maximum possible number.
     (e.g.: 8 -> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
3 -> Split into 1s.
     (e.g.: 8 -> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
The new numbers (from the splitting) have always to be in ascending order.
So in the array every even number is replaced by the new odd numbers from the splitting.
```

Your method will get as parameters the input-array and the number of the way for splitting the even numbers.

Some Examples
```
[1,10,1,3],0 -> [1,5,5,1,3]
[1,10,1,3],1 -> [1,1,9,1,3]
[1,10,1,3],2 -> [1,5,5,1,3]
[1,10,1,3],3 -> [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3]

[1,1,3,8],0 -> [1,1,3,3,5]
[1,1,3,8],1 -> [1,1,3,1,7]
[1,1,3,8],2 -> [1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
[1,1,3,8],3 -> [1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
```

The array will never be null and will always contain only integer numbers > 0. Also your result-array must contain only integer numbers > 0.
The way-parameter will always be between inclusive 0 and inclusive 3 (0,1,2,3).

You must not change the input-array!

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) 

I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!

# Context

According to Wikipedia : ""The seventh son of a seventh son is a concept from folklore regarding special powers given to, or held by, such a son. **The seventh son must come from an unbroken line with no female siblings born between, and be, in turn, born to such a seventh son.**""

# Your task

You will be given a string of JSON, consisting of a family tree containing people's names, genders and children. Your task will be to find the seventh sons of seventh sons in the family tree, and return a __set__ of their names. If there are none, return an __empty set__.

## Tips

* Have a good look at the sample test cases.

* For a seventh son to be a seventh son, there must not be any daughters in the line leading to him. There may be daughters after him, though.

* **You may want to use the json module for this one.**

The year is 2088 and the Radical Marxist Socialist People's Party (RMSPP) has just seized power in Brazil.

Their first act in power is absolute wealth equality through coercive redistribution.

Create a function that redistributes all wealth equally among all citizens.

Wealth is represented as an array/list where every index is the wealth of a single citizen. The function should mutate the input such that every index has the same amount of wealth. **MUTATE the input array/list, don't return anything.**

See example:

```python
wealth = [5, 10, 6]  # This represents:
                     # citizen 1 has wealth 5
                     # citizen 2 has wealth 10
                     # citizen 3 has wealth 6

redistribute_wealth(wealth) # mutates wealth list
wealth => [7, 7, 7] # wealth has now been equally redistributed

```

Info:

- **MUTATE the input array/list, don't return anything**

- Input is garantueed to hold at least 1 or more citizens

- Wealth of citizen will an integer with minimum 0 (negative wealth not possible)

- Handling of floating point error will not be tested

# Story

You were supposed to implement a node-based calculator. Hopefully for you, a colleague agreed to do the task. When the management saw the code, they were infuriated with its low quality, and as a punishment told you to shorten it as much as possible...

___

# Task

You will be given a ready solution passing all the fixed and random tests. Unfortunately for you, it is very long and overly repetitive. Current code length is `901` characters. Your task is to shorten it to at most `300` characters.

**Note/hint**: you can modify the implementation any way you want, as long as it is written using only OOP; the sample tests check solution's functionality the same way as the final tests do - if your solution passes the former, it will also pass the latter.

According to Gary Chapman, marriage counselor and the author of [""The Five Love Languages""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages) books, there are five major ways to express our love towards someone: *words of affirmation, quality time, gifts, acts of service,* and *physical touch*. These are called the love languages. Usually, everyone has a main language: the one that he/she ""speaks"" and understands best. In a relationship, it's import to find your partner's main love language, so that you get along better with each other.

## Your task

Unfortunately, your relationship got worse lately... After a long discussion with your partner, you agreed to give yourself a few weeks to improve it, otherwise you split up...

You will be given a `partner` instance, and `n` weeks. The `partner`  has a `.response` method, and the responses may be: `""positive""` or `""neutral""`. You can try to get a response once a day, thus you have `n * 7` tries in total to find the main love language of your partner!

```if-not:haskell
The love languages are: `""words"", ""acts"", ""gifts"", ""time"", ""touch""` (available predefined as `LOVE_LANGUAGES`)
```
```if:haskell
The love languages are: `Words, Acts, Gifts, Time, Touch` ( available `Preloaded` as `LoveLanguage` )
```

Note: your partner may (and will) sometimes give a positive response to any love language (""false positive""), but the main one has a much higher possibility. On the other hand, you may get a neutral response even for the main language, but with a low possibility (""false negative"").

There will be 50 tests. Although it's difficult to fail, in case you get unlucky, just run the tests again. After all, a few weeks may not be enough...

## Examples

```python
main love language: ""words""

partner.response(""words"") ==> ""positive""
partner.response(""acts"")  ==> ""neutral""
partner.response(""words"") ==> ""positive""
partner.response(""time"")  ==> ""neutral""
partner.response(""acts"")  ==> ""positive""    # false positive
partner.response(""gifts"") ==> ""neutral""
partner.response(""words"") ==> ""neutral""     # false negative
etc.
```

My third kata, write a function `check_generator` that examines the status of a Python generator expression `gen` and returns `'Created'`, `'Started'` or `'Finished'`. For example:

`gen = (i for i in range(1))` >>> returns `'Created'` (the generator has been initiated)

`gen = (i for i in range(1)); next(gen, None)` >>> returns `'Started'` (the generator has yielded a value)

`gen = (i for i in range(1)); next(gen, None); next(gen, None)` >>> returns `'Finished'` (the generator has been exhuasted)

For an introduction to Python generators, read: https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators.

Please do vote and rank the kata, and provide any feedback.

Hint: you can solve this if you know the right module to use.

# Find the gatecrashers on CocoBongo parties

CocoBongo is a club with very nice parties. However, you only can get inside if you know at least one other guest. Unfortunately, some gatecrashers can appear at those parties. The gatecrashers do not know any other party member and should not be at our amazing party!

We will give to you a collection with all party members and a collection with some guests and their invitations. Your mission is to find out those gatecrashers and give us a sorted array of them.

Note that invitations are undirectional relations, so if guest `A` invites `B`, we can consider that `B` also knows `A`. Once the relation `(A, {B})` appears on the invitations collection, the reverse relation `(B, {A})` may or may not appear in the input. You need to take care of that.

## Example

```python
party_members = [0,1,2,3,4]
invitations = [ (0, [1,2]), (2, [3]) ]
gatecrashers = [4]
```

## Explanation

We have `invitations = [ (0, [1,2]), (2, [3]) ]`.  
Guest `0` has invited guests `1` and `2`; also, guest `2` has invited guest `3`.
However, noone has invited guest `4`, so he is a gatecrasher.

Your task is to build a model^(1) which can predict y-coordinate.
You can pass tests if predicted y-coordinates are inside error margin.

You will receive train set which should be used to build a model. 
After you build a model tests will call function ```predict``` and pass x to it. 

Error is going to be calculated with RMSE.

Blocked libraries: sklearn, pandas, tensorflow, numpy, scipy

Explanation
[1] A mining model is created by applying an algorithm to data, but it is more than an algorithm or a metadata container: it is a set of data, statistics, and patterns that can be applied to new data to generate predictions and make inferences about relationships.

# Toggling Grid
You are given a grid (2d array) of 0/1's. All 1's represents a solved puzzle. Your job is to come up with a sequence of toggle moves that will solve a scrambled grid.

Solved:

```
[ [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1] ]
``` 

""0"" (first row) toggle:
```
[ [0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1] ]
```

then ""3"" (first column) toggle:
```
[ [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 1],
  [0, 1, 1] ]
```

The numbers in quotes are codes for the row/column, and will be explained.

## Your task: findSolution()
Your task is to write a function, `findSolution()` (or `find_solution()`), which takes as input a 2d array, and returns an array of ""steps"" that represent a sequence of toggles to solve the puzzle.

For example:

```python
solution = find_solution(puzzle)
print(solution);
> [0, 3]
```
Note that, in the above example, `[1, 2, 4, 5]` is also a valid solution! Any solution will pass the tests.

The solution is tested like this, for each number in the solution:

```python
if n < puzzle.size:
  toggleRow(n)
else:
  toggleCol(n - puzzle.size)
```
To elaborate, possible n's for a 3x3 puzzle:

- Row numbers = (0    --> size - 1)
- Cols numbers = (size --> size * 2 - 1)

### Example of ""2"" toggle:

### Example of ""4"" toggle:

## More examples:

```python
puzzle = [
  [ 0, 1, 0 ],
  [ 1, 0, 1 ],
  [ 1, 0, 1 ]
];
solution = find_solution(puzzle)
print(solution);
> [0, 4]
```
let's try some bigger puzzles:

```python
puzzle = [
  [ 1, 0, 1, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 1, 0, 1, 1 ],
  [ 0, 1, 0, 1, 1 ],
  [ 0, 1, 0, 1, 1 ],
  [ 1, 0, 1, 0, 0 ]
];
solution = find_solution(puzzle)
print(solution);
> [ 0, 5, 4, 7 ]
```

```python
puzzle = [
  [ 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 ],
  [ 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 ],
  [ 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 ],
  [ 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 ],
  [ 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 ]
];
solution = find_solution(puzzle)
print(solution);
> [ 3, 10 ]
```

There are randomized tests with puzzles of up to 100x100 in size. Have fun!

Create a class Vector that has simple (3D) vector operators.

In your class, you should support the following operations, given Vector ```a``` and Vector ```b```:

```python
a + b # returns a new Vector that is the resultant of adding them
a - b # same, but with subtraction
a == b # returns true if they have the same magnitude and direction
a.cross(b) # returns a new Vector that is the cross product of a and b
a.dot(b) # returns a number that is the dot product of a and b
a.to_tuple() # returns a tuple representation of the vector.
str(a) # returns a string representation of the vector in the form """"
a.magnitude # returns a number that is the magnitude (geometric length) of vector a.
a.x # gets x component
a.y # gets y component
a.z # gets z component
Vector([a,b,c]) # creates a new Vector from the supplied 3D array.
Vector(a,b,c) # same as above
```
The test cases will not mutate the produced Vector objects, so don't worry about that.

# Task
 A boy is walking a long way from school to his home. To make the walk more fun he decides to add up all the numbers of the houses that he passes by during his walk. Unfortunately, not all of the houses have numbers written on them, and on top of that the boy is regularly taking turns to change streets, so the numbers don't appear to him in any particular order.

 At some point during the walk the boy encounters a house with number `0` written on it, which surprises him so much that he stops adding numbers to his total right after seeing that house.

 For the given sequence of houses determine the sum that the boy will get. It is guaranteed that there will always be at least one 0 house on the path.

# Example

 For `inputArray = [5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 5, 0, 2]`, the output should be `11`.

 The answer was obtained as `5 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 11`.

# Input/Output

 - `[input]` integer array `inputArray`

    Constraints: `5 ≤ inputArray.length ≤ 50, 0 ≤ inputArray[i] ≤ 10.`

 - `[output]` an integer

Lets play some Pong! 

![pong](http://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pong-gif-3.gif)

For those who don't know what Pong is, it is a simple arcade game where two players can move their paddles to hit a ball towards the opponent's side of the screen, gaining a point for each opponent's miss. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).

___

# Task:

You must finish the `Pong` class. It has a constructor which accepts the `maximum score` a player can get throughout the game, and a method called `play`. This method determines whether the current player hit the ball or not, i.e. if the paddle is at the sufficient height to hit it back. There're 4 possible outcomes: player successfully hits the ball back, player misses the ball, player misses the ball **and his opponent reaches the maximum score winning the game**, either player tries to hit a ball despite the game being over. You can see the input and output description in detail below.

### ""Play"" method input:

* ball position - The Y coordinate of the ball
* player position - The Y coordinate of the centre(!) of the current player's paddle

### ""Play"" method output:

One of the following strings:

* `""Player X has hit the ball!""` - If the ball ""hits"" the paddle
* `""Player X has missed the ball!""` - If the ball is above/below the paddle
* `""Player X has won the game!""` - If one of the players has reached the maximum score
* `""Game Over!""` - If the game has ended but either player still hits the ball

### Important notes:

* Players take turns hitting the ball, always starting the game with the Player 1.
* The paddles are `7` pixels in height.
* The ball is `1` pixel in height.

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

* `addWord` (or `add_word`) which adds a word,
* `search` which searches a literal word or a regular expression string containing lowercase letters `""a-z""` or `"".""` where `"".""` can represent any letter

You may assume that all given words contain only lowercase letters.

## Examples
```python
add_word(""bad"")
add_word(""dad"")
add_word(""mad"")

search(""pad"") == False
search(""bad"") == True
search("".ad"") == True
search(""b.."") == True
```

There are a **n** balls numbered from 0 to **n-1** (0,1,2,3,etc). Most of them have the same weight, but one is heavier. Your task is to find it.

Your function will receive two arguments - a `scales` object, and a ball count. The `scales` object has only one method:

```python
    get_weight(left, right)
```

where `left` and `right` are arrays of numbers of balls to put on left and right pan respectively.

If the method returns `-1` - left pan is heavier

If the method returns `1` - right pan is heavier

If the method returns `0` - both pans weigh the same

So what makes this the ""ubermaster"" version of this kata? First, it's not restricted to 8 balls as in the previous versions - your solution has to work for 8-500 balls. 

Second, you can't use the scale any more than mathematically necessary. Here's a chart:

    ball count | uses
    -----------------
           0-9 |    2
         10-27 |    3
         28-81 |    4
        82-243 |    5
       244-500 |    6

Everyday we go to different places to get our things done. Those places can be represented by specific location points `[ [, ], ... ]` on a map. I will be giving you an array of arrays that contain coordinates of the different places I had been on a particular day. Your task will be to find `peripheries (outermost edges)` of the bounding box that contains all the points.

Polly is 8 years old. She is eagerly awaiting Christmas as she has a bone to pick with Santa Claus. Last year she asked for a horse, and he brought her a dolls house. Understandably she is livid.

The days seem to drag and drag so Polly asks her friend to help her keep count of how long it is until Christmas, in days. She will start counting from the first of December.

Your function should take 1 argument (a Date object) which will be the day of the year it is currently. The function should then work out how many days it is until Christmas.

You and your friends have been battling it out with your Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em robots, but things have gotten a little boring. You've each decided to add some amazing new features to your robot and automate them to battle to the death.

Each robot will be represented by an object. You will be given two robot objects, and an object of battle tactics and how much damage they produce. Each robot will have a name, hit points, speed, and then a list of battle tacitcs they are to perform in order. Whichever robot has the best speed, will attack first with one battle tactic. 

Your job is to decide who wins.

Example:
```python
 robot_1 = {
  ""name"": ""Rocky"",
  ""health"": 100,
  ""speed"": 20,
  ""tactics"": [""punch"", ""punch"", ""laser"", ""missile""]
 }
 robot_2 = {
   ""name"": ""Missile Bob"",
   ""health"": 100,
   ""speed"": 21,
   ""tactics"": [""missile"", ""missile"", ""missile"", ""missile""]
 }
 tactics = {
   ""punch"": 20,
   ""laser"": 30,
   ""missile"": 35
 }

 fight(robot_1, robot_2, tactics) -> ""Missile Bob has won the fight.""
```

robot2 uses the first tactic, ""missile"" because he has the most speed. This reduces robot1's health by 35. Now robot1 uses a punch, and so on. 

**Rules**

- A robot with the most speed attacks first. If they are tied, the first robot passed in attacks first.
- Robots alternate turns attacking. Tactics are used in order.
- A fight is over when a robot has 0 or less health or both robots have run out of tactics.
- A robot who has no tactics left does no more damage, but the other robot may use the rest of his tactics.
- If both robots run out of tactics, whoever has the most health wins. Return the message ""{Name} has won the fight.""
- If both robots run out of tactics and are tied for health, the fight is a draw. Return ""The fight was a draw.""

**To Java warriors**

`Robot` class is immutable.

Linked Lists - Length & Count

Implement Length() to count the number of nodes in a linked list.
Implement Count() to count the occurrences of an integer in a linked list.

I've decided to bundle these two functions within the same Kata since they are both very similar.

The `push()`/`Push()` and `buildOneTwoThree()`/`BuildOneTwoThree()` functions do not need to be redefined.

You're putting together contact information for all the users of your website to ship them a small gift. You queried your database and got back a list of users, where each user is another list with up to two items: a string representing the user's name and their shipping zip code. Example data might look like:

```python
[[""Grae Drake"", 98110], [""Bethany Kok""], [""Alex Nussbacher"", 94101], [""Darrell Silver"", 11201]]
```
Notice that one of the users above has a name but _doesn't_ have a zip code.

Write a function `user_contacts()` that takes a two-dimensional list like the one above and returns a dictionary with an item for each user where the key is the user's name and the value is the user's zip code. If your data doesn't include a zip code then the value should be `None`.

For example, using the input above, `user_contacts()` would return this dictionary:
```python
{
    ""Grae Drake"": 98110,
    ""Bethany Kok"": None,
    ""Alex Nussbacher"": 94101,
    ""Darrell Silver"": 11201,    
}
```

You don't have to worry about leading zeros in zip codes.

# Introduction

Dots and Boxes is a pencil-and-paper game for two players (sometimes more). It was first published in the 19th century by Édouard Lucas, who called it la pipopipette. It has gone by many other names, including the game of dots, boxes, dot to dot grid, and pigs in a pen.

Starting with an empty grid of dots, two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. The player who completes the fourth side of a 1×1 box earns one point and takes another turn only if another box can be made. (A point is typically recorded by placing a mark that identifies the player in the box, such as an initial). The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner is the player with the most points. The board may be of any size. When short on time, a 2×2 board (a square of 9 dots) is good for beginners. A 5×5 is good for experts. (Source Wikipedia)

# Task

Your task is to complete the class called Game. You will be given the board size as an integer board that will be between 1 and 26, therefore the game size will be board x board. You will be given an array of lines that have already been taken, so you must complete all possible squares.

# Rules

1.  The integer board will be passed when the class is initialised.

2.  board will be between 1 and 26.

3.  The lines array maybe empty or contain a list of line integers.

4.  You can only complete a square if 3 out of the 4 sides are already complete.

5.  The lines array that is passed into the play() function may not be sorted numerically!

# Returns

Return an array of all the lines filled in including the original lines.

Return array must be sorted numerically.

Return array must not contain duplicate integers.

# Example 1
## Initialise
Initialise a board of 2 squares by 2 squares where ```board = 2```

## Line Numbering

## Line Input
So for the line input of `[1, 3, 4]` the below lines would be complete

to complete the square line `6` is needed
## Game Play
```python
board = 2
lines = [1, 3, 4]
game = Game(board)
game.play(lines) => [1, 3, 4, 6]
```

# Example 2
## Initialise
```python
board = 2
lines = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12]
game = Game.new(board)
game.play(lines) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
```
## Solution 

Good luck and enjoy!

Another rewarding day in the fast-paced world of WebDev. Man, you love your job! But as with any job, somtimes things can get a little tedious. Part of the website you're working on has a very repetitive structure, and writing all the HTML by hand is a bore. Time to automate! You want to write some functions that will generate the HTML for you. 

To organize your code, make of all your functions methods of a class called HTMLGen. Tag functions should be named after the tag of the element they create. Each function will take one argument, a string, which is the inner HTML of the element to be created. The functions will return the string for the appropriate HTML element.

For example, 

In JavaScript:

In Python:
```python
g = HTMLGen();
paragraph = g.p('Hello, World!')
block = g.div(paragraph)

# The following are now true
paragraph == 'Hello, World!'
block == 'Hello, World!'
```

Your HTMLGen class should have methods to create the following elements:

  * a
  * b
  * p
  * body
  * div
  * span
  * title
  * comment

Note: The comment method should wrap its argument with an HTML comment. It is the only method whose name does not match an HTML tag. So, ```g.comment('i am a comment')``` must produce ``````.

/-- numpy.nonzero: Return the indices of the elements that are non-zero.
    
    For a 1D array, returns a list containing the indices of all non-zero elements.
    The indices are returned in ascending order and correspond to positions where
    the input array has non-zero values.
    
    This function is commonly used for boolean indexing and finding positions
    of elements that satisfy certain conditions.

/-- numpy.linalg.qr: Compute the QR factorization of a matrix.
    
    Factor the matrix A as Q*R, where Q is orthonormal and R is upper-triangular.
    This is the 'reduced' mode QR decomposition for rectangular matrices.
    
    For a matrix A with shape (m, n) where m >= n, the QR decomposition produces:
    - Q: orthonormal matrix with shape (m, n) 
    - R: upper-triangular matrix with shape (n, n)
    
    The decomposition satisfies: A = Q @ R
    
    Parameters:
    - a: Matrix to be factored, shape (m, n) where m >= n
    
    Returns:
    - (Q, R): tuple where Q is orthonormal and R is upper-triangular
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. Reconstruction: A = Q @ R
    2. Q has orthonormal columns: Q^T @ Q = I
    3. R is upper-triangular: R[i,j] = 0 for i > j

    2. Strict ordering: For each index i, exactly one of the following holds:
       - x1[i] < x2[i] (result[i] = true)
       - x1[i] ≥ x2[i] (result[i] = false)
    3. Anti-symmetry: If less(x1, x2)[i] = true, then less(x2, x1)[i] = false
    4. Transitivity property: If less(x1, x2)[i] = true and less(x2, x3)[i] = true,
       then less(x1, x3)[i] = true
    5. Special values: NaN comparisons always return false (IEEE 754 standard)
    6. Irreflexivity: x[i] is never less than itself
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for basic comparison)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = true iff x1[i] < x2[i]

Computes the coefficients of a Chebyshev series of degree `deg` that is the
least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`.

The fitted polynomial is in the form:
p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * T_1(x) + ... + c_deg * T_deg(x)

where T_k(x) is the k-th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.

Specification: chebfit returns coefficients c such that the resulting Chebyshev series
minimizes the sum of squared errors between the original data points and the fitted polynomial.

The specification ensures:
1. The result has deg + 1 coefficients (from degree 0 to deg)
2. The degree must be less than the number of data points (deg < m) for a well-defined problem
3. The coefficients produce a Chebyshev polynomial that best fits the data in the least squares sense
4. The fitting minimizes the sum of squared residuals: Σ(y[i] - p(x[i]))²
   where p(x) is the Chebyshev polynomial with the computed coefficients
5. All x-coordinates must be in the interval [-1, 1] for standard Chebyshev polynomials,
   or the implementation should transform them appropriately
6. The Chebyshev basis provides better numerical conditioning than power series

    1. Empty coefficient matrix: When rows = 0 or cols = 0, returns zero vector
    2. Constant polynomial: When rows = 1 and cols = 1, returns c[0,0] at all points
    3. Linear separability: For c[i,j] = a[i] * b[j], result[k] = chebval(x[k], a) * chebval(y[k], b)
    4. Symmetry: chebval2d(x, y, c) and chebval2d(y, x, c^T) produce related results
    5. Clenshaw recursion: Implementation should use numerically stable recursion

/-- Specification: herme2poly converts Hermite series coefficients to polynomial coefficients.
    
    The function performs a basis transformation from Hermite E polynomials to standard polynomials.
    The transformation preserves the polynomial degree and maintains the coefficient ordering.
    
    For n = 1 or n = 2, the function returns the input unchanged.
    For n > 2, it applies a recurrence relation using the Hermite E polynomial recurrence.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - Preserves the polynomial degree (same vector length)
    - For single coefficient (n = 1): identity transformation
    - For degree 1 (n = 2): identity transformation  
    - For higher degrees: applies Hermite E to polynomial basis conversion
    - The result represents the same polynomial in standard monomial basis -/

/-- numpy.strings.add: Add arguments element-wise (string concatenation).

    Concatenates two vectors of strings element-wise. Each element of the result
    is the concatenation of the corresponding elements from the input vectors.

    This is equivalent to string concatenation using the + operator for each
    element pair. The function preserves the shape of the input arrays and
    handles empty strings appropriately.

    From NumPy documentation:
    - Parameters: x1, x2 (array_like) - Input arrays with string dtype
    - Returns: add (ndarray) - The concatenated strings, element-wise

    Mathematical Properties:
    1. Element-wise concatenation: result[i] = x1[i] ++ x2[i]
    2. Associativity: add(add(x1, x2), x3) = add(x1, add(x2, x3))
    3. Identity with empty strings: add(x, empty_vector) = x
    4. Preserves vector length: result.size = x1.size = x2.size
    5. Non-commutative: add(x1, x2) ≠ add(x2, x1) in general

/-- Specification: numpy.strings.add returns a vector where each element is the
    concatenation of the corresponding elements from x1 and x2.

    Mathematical Properties:
    1. Element-wise correctness: result[i] = x1[i] ++ x2[i] for all i
    2. Associativity: For any three string vectors a, b, c of the same length,
       add(add(a, b), c) = add(a, add(b, c))
    3. Identity with empty strings: add(x, zeros) = x where zeros is a vector of empty strings
    4. Preserves vector length: result.size = x1.size = x2.size
    5. String concatenation properties: preserves individual string properties

/-- numpy.strings.isnumeric: For each element, return True if there are only numeric characters in the element.

    This function checks if each string contains only numeric characters.
    Numeric characters include:
    1. ASCII digits (0-9) 
    2. Unicode characters with numeric value property (like fraction characters)
    
    The function returns True for non-empty strings that contain only numeric characters,
    and False for empty strings or strings containing any non-numeric characters.
    
    Based on the NumPy documentation examples:
    - '123' → True (only digits)
    - '123abc' → False (contains non-numeric characters)
    - '9.0' → False (decimal point is not numeric)
    - '1/4' → False (slash is not numeric)

    2. All characters in a[i] are numeric (satisfy a numeric character test)
    
    Mathematical Properties:
    - Empty strings return False: ∀ i, a.get i = """" → result.get i = false
    - Non-empty numeric strings return True: ∀ i, a.get i ≠ """" ∧ (a.get i).all isNumericChar → result.get i = true

    - Single numeric characters return True: ∀ i, (a.get i).length = 1 ∧ isNumericChar ((a.get i).get! 0) → result.get i = true
    
    The core behavior matches Python's str.isnumeric() where:

    - Strings with only numeric characters (including Unicode numeric) return True
    - Strings with any non-numeric characters return False
    - Decimal points and arithmetic symbols are not considered numeric

/-- numpy.strings.title: Return element-wise title cased version of string or unicode.

    Converts each string element in the input vector to title case. Title case means
    the first character of each word is uppercase and all other cased characters are
    lowercase. Words are typically separated by whitespace or non-alphabetic characters.

    The function preserves the shape of the input array and handles empty strings
    appropriately by returning them unchanged.

    From NumPy documentation:
    - Parameters: a (array_like) - Input array with string dtype
    - Returns: out (ndarray) - Output array with elements converted to title case

    Mathematical Properties:
    1. Element-wise transformation: result[i] = title(a[i]) for all i
    2. Length preservation: result[i].length = a[i].length for all i
    3. Title case transformation: first letter of each word uppercase, others lowercase
    4. Word boundary detection: non-alphabetic characters separate words
    5. Preserves vector length: result.size = a.size

/-- ufunc.at: Performs operation in-place at specified array indices.

    Performs an in-place operation on an array at specified indices, with special
    handling for repeated indices. Unlike standard array indexing, this function
    allows accumulation of results when the same index appears multiple times.

    This function is particularly useful for scatter operations where you need to
    accumulate values at specific indices without the buffering limitations of
    regular array indexing.

    From NumPy documentation:
    - Parameters: a (array_like) - target array, indices (array_like) - indexing specification,
      b (array_like, optional) - second operand for binary operations
    - Returns: None (modifies array in-place)

    Mathematical Properties:
    1. In-place modification: modifies the original array a
    2. Accumulation with repeated indices: when an index appears multiple times,
       the operation is applied multiple times
    3. Unbuffered operation: does not suffer from buffering issues of regular indexing
    4. Preserves array shape: only modifies values, not structure

/-- Specification: ufunc.at performs in-place operation at specified indices
    with proper handling of repeated indices.

    Mathematical Properties:
    1. In-place semantics: modifies the original array values
    2. Accumulation property: for repeated indices, operations accumulate
    3. Index correspondence: indices[i] determines where b[i] is applied
    4. Bounds safety: all indices must be valid for the array
    5. Preserves array length: result has same length as input array

    Precondition: All indices must be valid (within bounds of array a)
    Postcondition: For each index i in indices, the value at a[indices[i]] is
    modified by the operation with b[i], with accumulation for repeated indices

/-- Specification: nin returns the correct number of input arguments for each ufunc type.
    
    For binary ufuncs (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power), nin returns 2.
    For unary ufuncs (sin, cos, exp, log, sqrt, abs, modf), nin returns 1.
    
    This property is essential for ufunc introspection and validates that the
    number of inputs matches the mathematical definition of each operation.

    1. Binary operations consistently return 2 inputs
    2. Unary operations consistently return 1 input
