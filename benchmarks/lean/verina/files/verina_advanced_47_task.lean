-----Description-----
This task requires writing a Lean 4 method that merges all overlapping intervals from a given list of intervals.

Each interval is represented as a pair [start, end], indicating the start and end of the interval. If two intervals overlap, they should be merged into a single interval that spans from the minimum start to the maximum end of the overlapping intervals.

The goal is to return a list of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the input intervals after merging.

-----Input-----
The input consists of one array:

intervals: An array of pairs of integers where intervals[i] = [startᵢ, endᵢ] represents the start and end of the ith interval.

-----Output-----
The output is an array of pairs of integers:
Returns the list of merged, non-overlapping intervals sorted by their start times.
