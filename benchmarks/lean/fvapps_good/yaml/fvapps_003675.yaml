  In this Kata, we are going to reverse a string while maintaining the spaces (if any) in their original place.

  For example:
  ```
  solve("our code") = "edo cruo"
  -- Normal reversal without spaces is "edocruo". 
  -- However, there is a space at index 3, so the string becomes "edo cruo"

  solve("your code rocks") = "skco redo cruoy". 
  solve("codewars") = "srawedoc"
  ```
  More examples in the test cases. All input will be lower case letters and in some cases spaces.

  Good luck!
