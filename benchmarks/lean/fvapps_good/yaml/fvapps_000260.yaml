vc-description: |-
  /-
  Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

  Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

  Note:

         Division between two integers should truncate toward zero.
         The given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result and there won't be any divide by zero operation.

  Example 1:

  Input: ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]
  Output: 9
  Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

  Example 2:

  Input: ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"]
  Output: 6
  Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

  Example 3:

  Input: ["10", "6", "9", "3", "+", "-11", "*", "/", "*", "17", "+", "5", "+"]
  Output: 22
  Explanation: 
    ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
  = ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
  = ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
  = ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
  = (0 + 17) + 5
  = 17 + 5
  = 22
