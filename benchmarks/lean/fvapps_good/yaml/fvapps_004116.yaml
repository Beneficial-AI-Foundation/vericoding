  /-
  In this Kata, you will be given two positive integers `a` and `b` and your task will be to apply the following operations:

  ```
  i) If a = 0 or b = 0, return [a,b]. Otherwise, go to step (ii);
  ii) If a ≥ 2*b, set a = a - 2*b, and repeat step (i). Otherwise, go to step (iii);
  iii) If b ≥ 2*a, set b = b - 2*a, and repeat step (i). Otherwise, return [a,b].
  ```

  `a` and `b` will both be lower than 10E8.

  More examples in tests cases. Good luck!
