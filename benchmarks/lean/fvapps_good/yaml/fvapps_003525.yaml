vc-description: |-
  /-
  An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.

  Example: 
   - The starting array sequence is `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`
   - The mixed array with one deleted number is `[3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]`
   - Your function should return the int `5`.

  If no number was deleted from the array and no difference with it, your function should return the int `0`.

  Note that N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be `[]`).
