  Chef made two laddus with sweetness X and Y respectively. Cheffina comes and sees the chef created two laddus with different sweetness (might be same). Cheffina has the magical power to make the sweetness of laddus equal. Cheffina requires 1 unit of power to increase the sweetness of laddu by its original value i.e. 1 unit to convert Z to 2Z and 2 unit to convert Z to 3Z and so on… How many units of power does cheffina want to make the sweetness equal?

  -----Input:-----
  - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
  - Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $X, Y$. 

  -----Output:-----
  For each test case, output in a single line answer as power required.

  -----Constraints-----
  - $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
  - $1 \leq X,Y \leq 10^5$

  -----Sample Input:-----
  2
  2 2
  4 6

  -----Sample Output:-----
  0
  3

  -----EXPLANATION:-----
  For 1) Sweetness are same so no need to use power.
  For 2) 
  1st laddu
  2 Unit power = 4 -> 12
  2nd Laddu
  1 Unit power = 6 -> 12
  After using total 3 unit power sweetness of both laddus are same.
