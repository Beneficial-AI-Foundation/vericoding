"vc-description": "Sherlock has a new girlfriend (so unlike him!). Valentine's day\
  \ is coming and he wants to gift her some jewelry.\n\nHe bought n pieces of jewelry.\
  \ The i-th piece has price equal to i + 1, that is, the prices of the jewelry are\
  \ 2, 3, 4, ... n + 1.\n\nWatson gave Sherlock a challenge to color these jewelry\
  \ pieces such that two pieces don't have the same color if the price of one piece\
  \ is a prime divisor of the price of the other piece. Also, Watson asked him to\
  \ minimize the number of different colors used.\n\nHelp Sherlock complete this trivial\
  \ task.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤\
  \ 100000) — the number of jewelry pieces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line\
  \ of output should contain a single integer k, the minimum number of colors that\
  \ can be used to color the pieces of jewelry with the given constraints.\n\nThe\
  \ next line should consist of n space-separated integers (between 1 and k) that\
  \ specify the color of each piece in the order of increasing price.\n\nIf there\
  \ are multiple ways to color the pieces using k colors, you can output any of them.\n\
  \n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1 2 \nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n2\n2\
  \ 1 1 2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first input, the colors for first, second\
  \ and third pieces of jewelry having respective prices 2, 3 and 4 are 1, 1 and 2\
  \ respectively.\n\nIn this case, as 2 is a prime divisor of 4, colors of jewelry\
  \ having prices 2 and 4 must be distinct."
