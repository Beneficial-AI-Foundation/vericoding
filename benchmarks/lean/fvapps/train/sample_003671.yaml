"vc-description": "Three candidates take part in a TV show.\n\nIn order to decide\
  \ who will take part in the final game and probably become rich, they have to roll\
  \ the Wheel of Fortune!\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune is divided into 20 sections, each\
  \ with a number from 5 to 100 (only mulitples of 5).\n\nEach candidate can roll\
  \ the wheel once or twice and sum up the score of each roll.\nThe winner one that\
  \ is closest to 100 (while still being lower or equal to 100). \nIn case of a tie,\
  \ the candidate that rolled the wheel first wins.\n\nYou receive the information\
  \ about each candidate as an array of objects: each object should have a `name`\
  \ and a `scores` array with the candidate roll values.\n\nYour solution should return\
  \ the name of the winner or `false` if there is no winner (all scored more than\
  \ 100).\n\n__Example:__\n\n```python\nc1 = {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"scores\": [10,\
  \ 65]}\nc2 = {\"name\": \"Bill\", \"scores\": [90, 5]}\nc3 = {\"name\": \"Charlie\"\
  , \"scores\": [40, 55]}\nwinner([c1, c2, c3]) #Returns \"Bill\"\n```\n\nPlease note\
  \ that inputs may be invalid: in this case, the function should return false.\n\n\
  Potential errors derived from the specifications are:\n- More or less than three\
  \ candidates take part in the game.\n- A candidate did not roll the wheel or rolled\
  \ it more than twice.\n- Scores are not valid.\n- Invalid user entry (no name or\
  \ no score)."
