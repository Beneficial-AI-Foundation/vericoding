  \ will always be a number and there will always be at least 1 dog.\n\n```r\nThe\
  \ expected behaviour is as follows:\n- Your friend has fewer than 10 dogs:     \
  \               \"Hardly any\"\n- Your friend has at least 10 but fewer than 51\
  \ dogs:    \"More than a handful!\"\n- Your friend has at least 51 but not exactly\
  \ 101 dogs:  \"Woah that's a lot of dogs!\"\n- Your friend has 101 dogs:       \
  \                       \"101 DALMATIANS!!!\"\n\nYour friend will always have between\
  \ 1 and 101 dogs, inclusive.\n```"
