"vc-description": "Have you heard about Megamind? Megamind and Metro Man are two aliens\
  \ who came to earth. Megamind wanted to destroy the earth, while Metro Man wanted\
  \ to stop him and protect mankind. After a lot of fighting, Megamind finally threw\
  \ Metro Man up into the sky. Metro Man was defeated and was never seen again. Megamind\
  \ wanted to be a super villain. He believed that the difference between a villain\
  \ and a super villain is nothing but presentation. Megamind became bored, as he\
  \ had nobody or nothing to fight against since Metro Man was gone. So, he wanted\
  \ to create another hero against whom he would fight for recreation. But accidentally,\
  \ another villain named Hal Stewart was created in the process, who also wanted\
  \ to destroy the earth. Also, at some point Megamind had fallen in love with a pretty\
  \ girl named Roxanne Ritchi. This changed him into a new man. Now he wants to stop\
  \ Hal Stewart for the sake of his love. So, the ultimate fight starts now.\n\n*\
  \ Megamind has unlimited supply of guns named Magic-48. Each of these guns has `shots`\
  \ rounds of magic spells.\n* Megamind has perfect aim. If he shoots a magic spell\
  \ it will definitely hit Hal Stewart. Once hit, it decreases the energy level of\
  \ Hal Stewart by `dps` units.\n* However, since there are exactly `shots` rounds\
  \ of magic spells in each of these guns, he may need to swap an old gun with a fully\
  \ loaded one. This takes some time. Let’s call it swapping period. \n* Since Hal\
  \ Stewart is a mutant, he has regeneration power. His energy level increases by\
  \ `regen` unit during a swapping period. \n* Hal Stewart will be defeated immediately\
  \ once his energy level becomes zero or negative. \n* Hal Stewart initially has\
  \ the energy level of `hp` and Megamind has a fully loaded gun in his hand.\n* Given\
  \ the values of `hp`, `dps`, `shots` and `regen`, find the minimum number of times\
  \ Megamind needs to shoot to defeat Hal Stewart. If it is not possible to defeat\
  \ him,  return `-1` instead.\n\n# Example\nSuppose, `hp` = 13, `dps` = 4, `shots`\
  \ = 3 and `regen` = 1. There are 3 rounds of spells in the gun. Megamind shoots\
  \ all of them. Hal Stewart’s energy level decreases by 12 units, and thus his energy\
  \ level becomes 1. Since Megamind’s gun is now empty, he will get a new gun and\
  \ thus it’s a swapping period. At this time, Hal Stewart’s energy level will increase\
  \ by 1 unit and will become 2. However, when Megamind shoots the next spell, Hal’s\
  \ energy level will drop by 4 units and will become −2, thus defeating him. So it\
  \ takes 4 shoots in total to defeat Hal Stewart. However, in this same example if\
  \ Hal’s regeneration power was 50 instead of 1, it would have been impossible to\
  \ defeat Hal."
