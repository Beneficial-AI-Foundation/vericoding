"vc-description": "We start with a string $s$ consisting only of the digits $1$, $2$,\
  \ or $3$. The length of $s$ is denoted by $|s|$. For each $i$ from $1$ to $|s|$,\
  \ the $i$-th character of $s$ is denoted by $s_i$. \n\nThere is one cursor. The\
  \ cursor's location $\\ell$ is denoted by an integer in $\\{0, \\ldots, |s|\\}$,\
  \ with the following meaning:   If $\\ell = 0$, then the cursor is located before\
  \ the first character of $s$.  If $\\ell = |s|$, then the cursor is located right\
  \ after the last character of $s$.  If $0 < \\ell < |s|$, then the cursor is located\
  \ between $s_\\ell$ and $s_{\\ell+1}$. \n\nWe denote by $s_\\text{left}$ the string\
  \ to the left of the cursor and $s_\\text{right}$ the string to the right of the\
  \ cursor. \n\nWe also have a string $c$, which we call our clipboard, which starts\
  \ out as empty. There are three types of actions:  The Move action. Move the cursor\
  \ one step to the right. This increments $\\ell$ once.  The Cut action. Set $c \\\
  leftarrow s_\\text{right}$, then set $s \\leftarrow s_\\text{left}$.  The Paste\
  \ action. Append the value of $c$ to the end of the string $s$. Note that this doesn't\
  \ modify $c$. \n\nThe cursor initially starts at $\\ell = 0$. Then, we perform the\
  \ following procedure:  Perform the Move action once.  Perform the Cut action once.\
  \  Perform the Paste action $s_\\ell$ times.  If $\\ell = x$, stop. Otherwise, return\
  \ to step 1. \n\nYou're given the initial string $s$ and the integer $x$. What is\
  \ the length of $s$ when the procedure stops? Since this value may be very large,\
  \ only find it modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\nIt is guaranteed that $\\ell \\le |s|$ at\
  \ any time.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer\
  \ $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain\
  \ descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a\
  \ single integer $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le 10^6$). The second line of each test case consists\
  \ of the initial string $s$ ($1 \\le |s| \\le 500$). It is guaranteed, that $s$\
  \ consists of the characters \"1\", \"2\", \"3\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum\
  \ of $x$ in a single file is at most $10^6$. It is guaranteed that in each test\
  \ case before the procedure will stop it will be true that $\\ell \\le |s|$ at any\
  \ time.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing\
  \ a single integer denoting the answer for that test case modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\n\

  \ with the first test case. Initially, we have $s = $ 231. Initially, $\\ell = 0$\
  \ and $c = \\varepsilon$ (the empty string). The following things happen if we follow\
  \ the procedure above:\n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 1$.  Step 2, Cut\
  \ once: we get $s = $ 2 and $c = $ 31.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 2 times: we get\
  \ $s = $ 23131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 1 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n\
  \  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 2$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23 and\
  \ $c = $ 131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step\
  \ 4: $\\ell = 2 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once:\
  \ we get $\\ell = 3$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 231 and $c = $ 31131131.\
  \  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 1 time: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell\
  \ = 3 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\\
  ell = 4$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2313 and $c = $ 1131131.  Step 3, Paste\
  \ $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.  Step 4: $\\ell\
  \ = 4 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\\
  ell = 5$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23131 and $c = $ 13113111311311131131.\
  \  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 1 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.\
  \  Step 4: $\\ell = 5 = x$, so we stop. \n\nAt the end of the procedure, $s$ has\
  \ length $25$."
