"vc-description": "To give credit where credit is due: This problem was taken from\
  \ the ACMICPC-Northwest Regional Programming Contest. Thank you problem writers.\n\
  \nYou are helping an archaeologist decipher some runes. He knows that this ancient\
  \ society used a Base 10 system, and that they never start a number with a leading\
  \ zero. He's figured out most of the digits as well as a few operators, but he needs\
  \ your help to figure out the rest.\n\nThe professor will give you a simple math\
  \ expression, of the form\n\n```\n[number][op][number]=[number]\n```\n\nHe has converted\
  \ all of the runes he knows into digits. The only operators he knows are addition\
  \ (`+`),subtraction(`-`), and multiplication (`*`), so those are the only ones that\
  \ will appear. Each number will be in the range from -1000000 to 1000000, and will\
  \ consist of only the digits 0-9, possibly a leading -, and maybe a few ?s. If there\
  \ are ?s in an expression, they represent a digit rune that the professor doesn't\
  \ know (never an operator, and never a leading -). All of the ?s in an expression\
  \ will represent the same digit (0-9), and it won't be one of the other given digits\
  \ in the expression. No number will begin with a 0 unless the number itself is \
  \ 0, therefore 00 would not be a valid number. \n\nGiven an expression, figure out\
  \ the value of the rune represented by the question mark. If more than one digit\
  \ works, give the lowest one. If no digit works, well, that's bad news for the professor\
  \ - it means that he's got some of his runes wrong. output -1 in that case.\n\n\
  Complete the method to solve the expression to find the value of the unknown rune.\
  \ The method takes a string as a paramater repressenting the expression and will\
  \ return an int value representing the unknown rune or -1 if no such rune exists.\n\
  \n~~~if:php\n**Most of the time, the professor will be able to figure out most of\
  \ the runes himself, but sometimes, there may be exactly 1 rune present in the expression\
  \ that the professor cannot figure out (resulting in all question marks where the\
  \ digits are in the expression) so be careful ;)**\n~~~"
