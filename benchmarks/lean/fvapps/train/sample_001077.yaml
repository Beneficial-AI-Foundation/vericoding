"vc-description": "Chefu is Chef's little brother, he is 12 years old and he is new\
  \ to competitive programming.\nChefu is practicing very hard to become a very skilled\
  \ competitive programmer and win gold medal in IOI.\nNow Chefu is participating\
  \ in a contest and the problem that he is trying to solve states:\nGiven an array\
  \ A of N integers, find any i, j such that i <  j \nand Ai + Aj is maximum possible\
  \ \nunfortunately, there's no much time left before the end of the contest, so Chefu\
  \ doesn't have time to think of correct solution, so instead, he wrote a solution\
  \ that selects a random pair (i,  j) (i <  j) and output Ai + Aj. each pair is equiprobable\
  \ to be selected.\nNow Chefu wants your help to calculate the probability that his\
  \ solution will pass a particular input.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line contains\
  \ an integer T denoting the number of test-cases.\nFirst line of each test-case\
  \ contains a single integer N\nSecond line of each test-case contains N space-separated\
  \ integers A1 A2 ... AN\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test-case output a single\
  \ line containing a single number denoting the probability that Chefu's solution\
  \ to output a correct answer. your answer will be accepted if the absolute difference\
  \ between it and correct answer is less than 1e-6\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1\
  \ ≤ T ≤ 100\n- 2 ≤ N ≤ 100\n- 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1,000\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n3\n4\n\
