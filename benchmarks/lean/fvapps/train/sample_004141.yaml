"vc-description": "Fast & Furious Driving School's (F&F) charges for lessons are as\
  \ below: \n\n\n\nTime\nCost\n\n\nUp to 1st hour\n$30\n\n\nEvery subsequent half\
  \ hour**\n$10\n\n\n** Subsequent charges are calculated by rounding up to nearest\
  \ half hour.\n\n\nFor example, if student X has a lesson for 1hr 20 minutes, he\
  \ will be charged $40 (30+10) for 1 hr 30 mins and if he has a lesson for 5 minutes,\
  \ he will be charged $30 for the full hour. \n\nOut of the kindness of its heart,\
  \ F&F also provides a 5 minutes grace period. So, if student X were to have a lesson\
  \ for 65 minutes or 1 hr 35 mins, he will only have to pay for an hour or 1hr 30\
  \ minutes respectively. \n\nFor a given lesson time in minutes (min) , write a function\
  \ price to calculate how much the lesson costs."
