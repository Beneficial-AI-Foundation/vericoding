"vc-description": "You are an evil sorcerer at a round table with $N$ sorcerers (including\
  \ yourself). You can cast $M$ spells which have distinct powers $p_1, p_2, \\ldots,\
  \ p_M$.\nYou may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n\
  - Assign a living sorcerer to each positive integer cyclically to your left starting\
  \ from yourself ― the closest living sorcerer to your left is assigned to $1$, the\
  \ next living sorcerer to the left is assigned to $2$ and so on. Note that each\
  \ living sorcerer (including yourself) is assigned to an infinite number of integers.\n\
  - Choose a spell $j$ (possibly a spell you have chosen before) and kill the living\
  \ sorcerer assigned to $p_j$. You may not cast a spell to kill yourself. \n\nWhat\
  \ is the maximum number of sorcerers you can kill using zero or more operations?\n\
  \n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting\
  \ the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first\
  \ line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.\n- The\
  \ second line contains $M$ space-separated integers $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_M$.\n\n\
  -----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer\
  \ ― the maximum number of sorcerers you can kill.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1\
  \ \\le T \\le 1,000$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le M \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$\n\
  - $1 \\le p_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\n- $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_N$ are pairwise\
  \ distinct\n- the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$\n\

  Example case 1: The initial state is shown in the figure from the statement. We\
  \ can first use spell $1$ and kill the $5$-th sorcerer to our left, i.e. sorcerer\
  \ $2$. Now there are $3$ living sorcerers and the state is as shown in the following\
  \ figure:\n\nWe can use spell $1$ again and kill the current $5$-th living sorcerer\
  \ to our left, i.e. sorcerer $4$. Now there are $2$ living sorcerers and the state\
  \ is:\n\nFinally, we can use spell $1$ again and kill the only other living sorcerer,\
  \ i.e. sorcerer $3$. Now, none of the other sorcerers are alive. As we cannot cast\
  \ a spell to kill ourselves, we cannot improve the answer any further.\nExample\
  \ case 2: We can perform $4$ operations using the spell $p_1 = 2$ each time. We\
  \ can also instead use $p_2 = 4$ in the first two operations and $p_1 = 2$ in the\
  \ last two operations. Note that there may be multiple valid sequences of operations\
  \ that lead to the best answer.\nExample case 3: We cannot perform any operations\
  \ using any of the given spells, so we are unable to kill any sorcerers.\nExample\
  \ case 4: We can perform $1,755,647$ operations, each of them using the spell $p_1\
  \ = 998,244,353$."
