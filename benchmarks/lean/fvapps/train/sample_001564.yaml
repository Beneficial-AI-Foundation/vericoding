"vc-description": "# Ten-Pin Bowling\n\nIn the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls\
  \ a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end\
  \ of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane\
  \ and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after\
  \ two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player\
  \ will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum\
  \ of three total rolls. \n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will be given\
  \ a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this:\
  \ `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `\"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44\"`), where\
  \ each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents\
  \ spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore`\
  \ and return the players total score.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe scoring for ten-pin bowling\
  \ can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten\
  \ if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:\n\n### Frames\n\nIn Ten-Pin\
  \ Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which\
  \ can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get\
  \ all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll\
  \ each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on\
  \ the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**\n\
  \nIn this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In\
  \ this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9\
  \ points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their\
  \ third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling\
  \ scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.\n\n###\
  \ Strikes \nRepresented in this challenge as `'X'`\n\nA strike is scored when a\
  \ player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude\
  \ the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from\
  \ the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score\
  \ of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4)\
  \ and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nA perfect game in bowling is\
  \ 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'`\
  \ (in Java: `\"X X X X X X X X X XXX\"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.\n\
  \n### Spares\nRepresented in this challenge as `'/'`\n\nA spare is scored when a\
  \ player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will\
  \ be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames\
  \ `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24. The first frame would\
  \ be worth 15 (10 + 5) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nFor a more\
