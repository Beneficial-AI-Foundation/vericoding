"vc-description": "Chef is playing a game on the non-negative x-axis. It takes him\
  \ $1$ second to reach from $i^{th}$ position to $(i-1)^{th}$ position or $(i+1)^{th}$\
  \ position. The chef never goes to the negative x-axis. Also, Chef doesn't stop\
  \ at any moment of time.\nThe movement of chef can be described as follows.\n- At\
  \ the start he is standing at $x=0$ at time $0$.\n- In the first round, he moves\
  \ towards $x=1$ and comes back to the $x=0$ position. \n- In the second round, he\
  \ moves towards the $x=2$ and comes back again to $x=0$. \n- Generalizing, in the\
  \ $k^{th}$ round, he moves from $x=0$ to $x=k$ and then returns back to $x=0$ at\
  \ the end of the round. This goes on as the game progresses.\nFor Example, the path\
  \ of Chef for $3^{rd}$ round is given below.\n$0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0$ \nThe\
  \ overall path followed by Chef would look somewhat like this:\n$0 - 1 - 0 - 1 -\
  \ 2 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 3 - …$\nYou are given two\
  \ non-negative integers $N$ and $K$. You have to tell the time at which Chef arrives\
  \ at $x=N$ for the $K^{th}$ time. \nNote - Chef can not skip a position while visiting\
  \ the positions.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line contains $T$ the number of\
  \ test cases. Then the test cases follow.\n- Each test case contains a single line\
  \ of two integers $N$ and $K$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, print a\
  \ single line containing one integer -- the time taken by the chef to arrive at\
  \ $x=N$ for the $K^{th}$ time by modulo $1,000,000,007$.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n\
  - $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n- $0 \\le N \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le K \\le 10^9$\n\n-----Sample\
  \ Input:-----\n5\n0 1\n1 1\n2 1\n1 3\n4 6\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n0\n1\n4\n\
  5\n46\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nTest Case 1:\n\nChef starts the journey from the\
  \ $N = 0$ at time $t = 0$ and it's the first time $(K = 1)$, he is here. So, the\
  \ answer is $0$.  \nTest Case 2:\n\nChef starts the journey from the $N = 0$ at\
  \ time $t = 0$ then goes to $N = 1$ at $t = 1$ and it's the first time $(K = 1)$,\
  \ he is here. So, the answer is $1$.\nTest Case 4:\n\nThe path followed by Chef\
  \ to reach $1$ for the third time is given below.\n$0 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 1$\n\nHe\
  \ reaches $1$ for the third time at $t=5$."
