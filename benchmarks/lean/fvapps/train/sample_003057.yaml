"vc-description": "My friend John likes to go to the cinema. He can choose between\
  \ system A and system B.\n```\nSystem A : he buys a ticket (15 dollars) every time\n\
  System B : he buys a card (500 dollars) and a first ticket for 0.90 times the ticket\
  \ price, \nthen for each additional ticket he pays 0.90 times the price paid for\
  \ the previous ticket.\n```\n#Example: \nIf John goes to the cinema 3 times:\n```\n\
  System A : 15 * 3 = 45\nSystem B : 500 + 15 * 0.90 + (15 * 0.90) * 0.90 + (15 *\
  \ 0.90 * 0.90) * 0.90 ( = 536.5849999999999, no rounding for each ticket)\n```\n\
  John wants to know how many times he must go to the cinema so that the *final result*\
  \ of System B, when rounded *up* to the next dollar, will be cheaper than System\
  \ A.\n\nThe function `movie` has 3 parameters: `card` (price of the card), `ticket`\
  \ (normal price of \na ticket), `perc` (fraction of what he paid for the previous\
  \ ticket) and returns the first `n` such that\n```\nceil(price of System B) < price\
  \ of System A.\n```\nMore examples:\n```\nmovie(500, 15, 0.9) should return 43 \n\
  \    (with card the total price is 634, with tickets 645)\nmovie(100, 10, 0.95)\
  \ should return 24 \n    (with card the total price is 235, with tickets 240)\n\
