"vc-description": "Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this\
  \ test is `to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others`.\
  \ Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in **evenness**.\
  \ Help Bob — to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers\
  \ finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.\n\
  \n`!` Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a `real IQ test`, which means\
  \ indexes of the elements start from `1 (not 0)`\n\n##Examples :\n\n \n```python\n\
  iq_test(\"2 4 7 8 10\") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers\
  \ are even\n\niq_test(\"1 2 1 1\") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest\
  \ of the numbers are odd\n```"
