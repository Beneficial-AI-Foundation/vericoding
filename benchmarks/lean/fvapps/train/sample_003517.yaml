"vc-description": "# Solve For X\n\nYou will be given an equation as a string and\
  \ you will need to [solve for X](https://www.mathplacementreview.com/algebra/basic-algebra.php#solve-for-a-variable)\
  \ and return x's value. For example: \n\n```python\nsolve_for_x('x - 5 = 20') #\
  \ should return 25\nsolve_for_x('20 = 5 * x - 5') # should return 5\nsolve_for_x('5\
  \ * x = x + 8') # should return 2\nsolve_for_x('(5 - 3) * x = x + 2') # should return\
  \ 2\n```\n\nNOTES:\n * All numbers will be whole numbers\n * Don't forget about\
  \ the [order of operations](https://www.mathplacementreview.com/algebra/basic-algebra.php#order-of-operations).\n\
  \ * If the random tests don't pass the first time, just run them again."
