"vc-description": "In case you might be unlucky enough not to know the best dark fantasy\
  \ franchise ever, Berserk tells the story of a man that, hating gratuitous violence,\
  \ decided to become a mercenary (thus one who sells violence, no gratuity anymore!)\
  \ and starts an epic struggle against apparently unsormountable odds, unsure if\
  \ he really wants to pursue a path of vengeance or to try to focus on his remaining\
  \ and new loved ones.\n\n*The main character, Gatsu,ready to start yet another Tuesday*\n\
  \nOk, the first part was a joke, but you can read more about the tale of the main\
  \ character, a \"Byronic hero\" for wikipedia, in other pages like [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk_(manga%29).\n\
  \nAfter an insanely long waiting, finally fans got the [follow up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk_(2016_TV_series%29)\
  \ of [the acclaimed 90s show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk_(1997_TV_series%29).\n\
  \nRegrettably, while the first adaption was considerably shortened, the latter was\
  \ quite butchered, missing entire parts, like the \"lost children\" arc, but that\
  \ would have actual children butchered and thus you might get why it was decided\
  \ to skip it. And fan could somehow cope with it, if it was not for the very meager\
  \ use of CG (Computer Graphic).\n\nLuckily, I am a simple man and every time Gatsu\
  \ swings his humongous sword, that is enough to make me forget about everything\
  \ else.\n\nYour goal is to build a Berserk Rater function that takes an array/list\
  \ of events of each episode (as strings) and calculate a rating based on that: you\
  \ start with a score of 0 (hey, it's a work from Miura-sensei, I have great expectations\
  \ to satisfy!) and you have to:\n\n* subtract 2 each time \"CG\" is mentioned (case\
  \ insensitive);\n* add 5 every time \"Clang\" is mentioned (case insensitive);\n\
  * if a sentence has both \"Clang\" and \"CG\", \"Clang\" wins (add 5);\n* remove\
  \ 1 every time neither is mentioned (I get bored easily, you know, particularly\
  \ if you remove important parts and keep side character whining for half an episode).\n\
  \nYou should then return a string, structured like this:\n\n* if the finale score\
  \ is less than 0: \"worstest episode ever\";\n* if the score is between 0 and 10:\
  \ the score itself, as a string;\n* if the finale score is more than 10: \"bestest\
  \ episode ever\".\n\nExamples:\n```python\nberserk_rater([\"is this the CG from\
  \ a P2 game?\",\"Hell, no! Even the CG in the Dreamcast game was more fluid than\
  \ this!\",\"Well, at least Gatsu does his clang even against a mere rabbit\", \"\
  Hey, Cosette was not in this part of the story!\", \"Ops, everybody dead again!\
  \ Well, how boring...\"])==\"worstest episode ever\"\nberserk_rater([\"missing the\
  \ Count arc\",\"lame CG\",\"Gatsu doing its clang against a few henchmen\", \"even\
  \ more lame CG\"])==\"0\"\nberserk_rater([\"Farnese unable to shut the fuck up\"\
  ,\"awful CG dogs assaulting everybody\", \"Gatsu clanging the pig apostle!\"])==\"\
  2\"\nberserk_rater([\"spirits of the dead attacking Gatsu and getting clanged for\
  \ good\", \"but the wheel spirits where really made with bad CG\", \"Isidoro trying\
  \ to steal the dragon Slayer and getting a sort of clang on his face\", \"Gatsu\
  \ vs. the possessed horse: clang!\", \"Farnese whining again...\",\"a shame the\
  \ episode ends with that scrappy CG\"])==\"10\"\nberserk_rater([\"Holy chain knights\
  \ being dicks\", \"Serpico almost getting clanged by Gatsu, but without losing his\
  \ composure\",\"lame CG\",\"Luka getting kicked\",\"Gatsu going clang against the\
  \ angels\", \"Gatsu clanging vs Mozgus, big time!\"])==\"bestest episode ever\"\n\
  ```\n\nExtra cookies if you manage to solve it all using a `reduce/inject` approach.\n\
