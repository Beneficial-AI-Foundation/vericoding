"vc-description": "An Arithmetic Progression is defined as one in which there is a\
  \ constant difference between the consecutive terms of a given series of numbers.\
  \ You are provided with consecutive elements of an Arithmetic Progression. There\
  \ is however one hitch: exactly one term from the original series is missing from\
  \ the set of numbers which have been given to you. The rest of the given series\
  \ is the same as the original AP.  Find the missing term.  \n\nYou have to write\
  \ a function that receives a list, list size will always be at least 3 numbers.\
  \ The missing term will never be the first or last one.\n\n## Example\n```python\n\
  find_missing([1, 3, 5, 9, 11]) == 7\n```\n\nPS: This is a sample question of the\
  \ facebook engineer challenge on interviewstreet.\nI found it quite fun to solve\
  \ on paper using math, derive the algo that way.\nHave fun!"
