"vc-description": "Chef has many friends, but his best friend is Hemant. They both\
  \ love to watch anime.\nIn fact, their weekends are meant for that only. Also, Hemant\
  \ is highly into games, of which Chef is unaware. Hemant once gave a game to Chef\
  \ and asked him to determine the winner of the game. Since the Chef is busy, and\
  \ you are also his friend, he asked you to help him.\nThe Game is played between\
  \ two players, $A$ and $B$. There are $N$ marbles. $A$ and $B$ plays alternately,\
  \ and $A$ goes first. Each player can choose $1$ marble or $even$ number of marbles\
  \ in his turn. The player who is not able to choose any marbles loses the game.\n\
  \n-----Input:-----\n- The first line consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the\
  \ number of test cases.\n- The Second line contains an integers $N$, denoting the\
  \ number of marbles.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, print the name of\
  \ the player who loses the game.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n\
  - $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n3\n1 \n3\n7 \n\n-----Sample\
  \ Output:-----\nB\nA\nB"
