"vc-description": "The Petrozavodsk camp takes place in about one month. Jafar wants\
  \ to participate in the camp, but guess what? His coach is Yalalovichik.\nYalalovichik\
  \ is a legendary coach, famous in the history of competitive programming. However,\
  \ he is only willing to send to the camp students who solve really hard problems\
  \ on Timus. The deadline that Yalalovichik set before has passed and he refuses\
  \ to send Jafar to the camp.\nJafar decided to make Yalalovichik happy in hopes\
  \ of changing his decision, so he invented a new sequence of numbers and named them\
  \ Yalalovichik numbers. Jafar is writing a research paper about their properties\
  \ and wants to publish it in the Science Eagle yearly journal.\nA Yalalovichik number\
  \ is created in the following way:\n- Consider an integer $N$ in decimal notation;\
  \ let's call it the base of the Yalalovichik number $Y_N$. $N$ may not contain the\
  \ digit $0$.\n- Treat $N$ as a decimal string. Compute all left shifts of this string\
  \ $N_0, N_1, \\ldots, N_{|N|-1}$ ($|N|$ denotes the number of digits of $N$); specifically,\
  \ $N_k$ denotes the string formed by moving the first $k$ digits of $N$ to the end\
  \ in the same order.\n- Concatenate the strings $N_0, N_1, \\ldots, N_{|N|-1}$.\
  \ The resulting string is the decimal notation of $Y_N$.\nFor example, if $N = 123$,\
  \ the left shifts are $123, 231, 312$ and thus $Y_N = 123231312$.\nYou are given\
  \ the base $N$. Calculate the value of $Y_N$ modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n-----Input-----\n\
  - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number\
  \ of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only\
  \ line of each test case contains a single decimal integer $N$.\n\n-----Output-----\n\
  For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the value of the\
  \ Yalalovichik number $Y_N$ modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le\
  \ T \\le 200$\n- $|N| \\le 10^5$\n- $N$ does not contain the digit $0$\n- the sum\
  \ of $|N|$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\n\n-----Example Input-----\n\
  1\n123\n\n-----Example Output-----\n123231312"
