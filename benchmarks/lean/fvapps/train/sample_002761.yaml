"vc-description": "Following from the previous kata and taking into account how cool\
  \ psionic powers are compare to the Vance spell system (really, the idea of slots\
  \ to dumb down the game sucks, not to mention that D&D became a smash hit among\
  \ geeks, so...), your task in this kata is to create a function that returns how\
  \ many power points you get as a psion [because psions are the coolest, they allow\
  \ for a lot of indepth tactic playing and adjusting for psychic warriors or wilders\
  \ or other non-core classes would be just an obnoxious core].\n\nConsider both [the\
  \ psion power points/days table](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Psion#Making_a_Psion)\
  \ and [bonus power points](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/classes/#Table_Ability_Modifiers_and_Bonus_Power_Points)\
  \ to figure out the correct reply, returned as an integer; the usual interpretation\
  \ is that bonus power points stop increasing after level 20, but for the scope of\
  \ this kata, we will pretend they keep increasing as they did before.\n\nTo compute\
  \ the total, you will be provided, both as non-negative integers:\n\n* class level\
  \ (assume they are all psion levels and remember the base power points/day halts\
  \ after level 20)\n* manifesting attribute score (Intelligence, to be more precise)\
  \ to determine the total, provided the score is high enough for the character to\
  \ manifest at least one power.\n\nSome examples:\n\n```python\npsion_power_points(1,0)\
  \ == 0\npsion_power_points(1,10) == 0\npsion_power_points(1,11) == 2\npsion_power_points(1,20)\
  \ == 4\npsion_power_points(21,30) == 448\n```\n\n*Note: I didn't explain things\
  \ in detail and just pointed out to the table on purpose, as my goal is also to\
  \ train the pattern recognition skills of whoever is going to take this challenges,\
  \ so do not complain about a summary description. Thanks :)*\n\nIn the same series:\n\
