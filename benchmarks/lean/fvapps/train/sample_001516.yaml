"vc-description": "Indian National Olympiad in Informatics 2016\n\tBoing Inc, has\
  \ N employees, numbered 1 ... N. Every employee other than Mr. Hojo (the head of\
  \ the company) has a manager (P[i] denotes the manager of employee i). Thus an employee\
  \ may manage any number of other employees but he reports only to one manager, so\
  \ that the organization forms a tree with Mr. Hojo at the root. We say that employee\
  \ B is a subordinate of employee A if B appears in the subtree rooted at A.\n\n\t\
  Mr. Hojo, has hired Nikhil to analyze data about the employees to suggest how to\
  \ identify faults in Boing Inc. Nikhil, who is just a clueless consultant, has decided\
  \ to examine wealth disparity in the company. He has with him the net wealth of\
  \ every employee (denoted A[i] for employee i). Note that this can be negative if\
  \ the employee is in debt. He has already decided that he will present evidence\
  \ that wealth falls rapidly as one goes down the organizational tree. He plans to\
  \ identify a pair of employees i and j, j a subordinate of i, such A[i] - A[j] is\
  \ maximum. Your task is to help him do this.\n\n\tSuppose, Boing Inc has 4 employees\
  \ and the parent (P[i]) and wealth information (A[i]) for each employee are as follows:\n\
  \ni\t\t1\t2\t3\t4\nA[i]\t\t5\t10\t6\t12\nP[i]\t\t2\t-1\t4\t2\n\nP[2] = -1 indicates\
  \ that employee 2 has no manager, so employee 2 is Mr. Hojo.\n\nIn this case, the\
  \ possible choices to consider are (2,1) with a difference in wealth of 5, (2,3)\
  \ with 4, (2,4) with -2 and (4,3) with 6. So the answer is 6.\n\n\n-----Input format-----\n\
  \tThere will be one line which contains (2*N + 1) space-separate integers. The first\
  \ integer is N, giving the number of employees in the company. The next N integers\
  \ A[1], .., A[N] give the wealth of the N employees. The last N integers are P[1],\
  \ P[2], .., P[N], where P[i] identifies the manager of employee i. If Mr. Hojo is\
  \ employee i then, P[i] = -1, indicating that he has no manager.\n\n\n-----Output\
  \ format-----\n\tOne integer, which is the needed answer.\n\n\n-----Test data-----\n\
