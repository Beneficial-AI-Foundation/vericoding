"vc-description": "The Bubble Cup hypothesis stood unsolved for $130$ years. Who ever\
  \ proves the hypothesis will be regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of\
  \ our time! A famous mathematician Jerry Mao managed to reduce the hypothesis to\
  \ this problem:\n\nGiven a number $m$, how many polynomials $P$ with coefficients\
  \ in set ${\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}}$ have: $P(2)=m$?\n\nHelp Jerry Mao solve the long\
  \ standing problem!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer\
  \ $t$ $(1 \\leq t \\leq 5\\cdot 10^5)$ - number of test cases.\n\nOn next line there\
  \ are $t$ numbers, $m_i$ $(1 \\leq m_i \\leq 10^{18})$ - meaning that in case $i$\
  \ you should solve for number $m_i$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case\
  \ $i$, print the answer on separate lines: number of polynomials $P$ as described\
  \ in statement such that $P(2)=m_i$, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\n\
  Input\n2\n2 4\n\nOutput\n2\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn first case, for $m=2$,\
  \ polynomials that satisfy the constraint are $x$ and $2$.\n\nIn second case, for\
  \ $m=4$, polynomials that satisfy the constraint are $x^2$, $x + 2$, $2x$ and $4$."
