"vc-description": "# Your Task\nThe city of Darkishland has a strange hotel with infinite\
  \ rooms. The groups that come to this hotel follow the following rules:\n\n* At\
  \ the same time only members of one group can rent the hotel.\n\n* Each group comes\
  \ in the morning of the check-in day and leaves the hotel in the evening of the\
  \ check-out day.\n\n* Another group comes in the very next morning after the previous\
  \ group has left the hotel.\n\n* A very important property of the incoming group\
  \ is that it has one more member than its previous group unless it is the starting\
  \ group. You will be given the number of members of the starting group.\n\n* A group\
  \ with n members stays for n days in the hotel. For example, if a group of four\
  \ members comes on 1st August in the morning, it will leave the hotel on 4th August\
  \ in the evening and the next group of five members will come on 5th August in the\
  \ morning and stay for five days and so on.\n\nGiven the initial group size you\
  \ will have to find the group size staying in the hotel on a specified day.\n# Input\n\
  S denotes the initial size of the group and D denotes that you will have to find\
  \ the group size staying in the hotel on D-th day (starting from 1). A group size\
  \ S\nmeans that on the first day a group of S members comes to the hotel and stays\
  \ for S days. Then comes a group of S + 1 members according to the previously described\
  \ rules and so on."
