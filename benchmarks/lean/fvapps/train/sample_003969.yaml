"vc-description": "Background\n----------\nIn another dimension, there exist two immortal\
  \ brothers: Solomon and Goromon. As sworn loyal subjects to the time elemental,\
  \ Chronixus, both Solomon and Goromon were granted the power to create temporal\
  \ folds. By sliding through these temporal folds, one can gain entry to parallel\
  \ dimensions where time moves relatively faster or slower.\n\nGoromon grew dissatisfied\
  \ and one day betrayed Chronixus by stealing the Temporal Crystal, an artifact used\
  \ to maintain the time continuum. Chronixus summoned Solomon and gave him the task\
  \ of tracking down Goromon and retrieving the Temporal Crystal.\n\nUsing a map given\
  \ to Solomon by Chronixus, you must find Goromon's precise location.\n\nMission\
  \ Details\n---------------\nThe map is represented as a 2D array. See the example\
  \ below:\n\n```python\nmap_example = [[1,3,5],[2,0,10],[-3,1,4],[4,2,4],[1,1,5],[-3,0,12],[2,1,12],[-2,2,6]]\n\
  ```\nHere are what the values of each subarray represent:\n- **Time Dilation:**\
  \ With each additional layer of time dilation entered, time slows by a factor of\
  \ `2`. At layer `0`, time passes normally. At layer `1`, time passes at half the\
  \ rate of layer `0`. At layer `2`, time passes at half the rate of layer `1`, and\
  \ therefore one quarter the rate of layer `0`.\n- **Directions** are as follow:\
  \ `0 = North, 1 = East, 2 = South, 3 = West`\n- **Distance Traveled:** This represents\
  \ the distance traveled relative to the current time dilation layer. See below:\n\
  \n```\nThe following are equivalent distances (all equal a Standard Distance of\
  \ 100):\nLayer: 0, Distance: 100\nLayer: 1, Distance: 50\nLayer: 2, Distance: 25\n\
  ```\nFor the `mapExample` above:\n```\nmapExample[0] -> [1,3,5]\n1 represents the\
  \ level shift of time dilation\n3 represents the direction\n5 represents the distance\
  \ traveled relative to the current time dilation layer\n\nSolomon's new location\
  \ becomes [-10,0]\n\nmapExample[1] -> [2,0,10]\nAt this point, Solomon has shifted\
  \ 2 layers deeper.\nHe is now at time dilation layer 3.\nSolomon moves North a Standard\
  \ Distance of 80.\nSolomon's new location becomes [-10,80]\n\nmapExample[2] -> [-3,1,4]\n\
  At this point, Solomon has shifted out 3 layers.\nHe is now at time dilation layer\
  \ 0.\nSolomon moves East a Standard Distance of 4.\nSolomon's new location becomes\
  \ [-6,80]\n```\nYour function should return Goromon's `[x,y]` coordinates.\n\nFor\
  \ `mapExample`, the correct output is `[346,40]`.\n\nAdditional Technical Details\n\
  ----------------------------\n- Inputs are always valid.\n- Solomon begins his quest\
  \ at time dilation level `0`, at `[x,y]` coordinates `[0,0]`.\n- Time dilation level\
  \ at any point will always be `0` or greater.\n- Standard Distance is the distance\
  \ at time dilation level `0`.\n- For given distance `d` for each value in the array:\
  \ `d >= 0`.\n- Do not mutate the input\n\n**Note from the author:** I made up this\
