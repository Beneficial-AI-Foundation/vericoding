"vc-description": "Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.  There are an even\
  \ number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number\
  \ of stones piles[i].\nThe objective of the game is to end with the most stones. \
  \ The total number of stones is odd, so there are no ties.\nAlex and Lee take turns,\
  \ with Alex starting first.  Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones\
  \ from either the beginning or the end of the row.  This continues until there are\
  \ no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.\nAssuming\
  \ Alex and Lee play optimally, return True if and only if Alex wins the game.\n\
   \nExample 1:\nInput: piles = [5,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nAlex starts\
  \ first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.\nSay he takes the first 5,\
  \ so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].\nIf Lee takes 3, then the board is [4, 5],\
  \ and Alex takes 5 to win with 10 points.\nIf Lee takes the last 5, then the board\
  \ is [3, 4], and Alex takes 4 to win with 9 points.\nThis demonstrated that taking\
  \ the first 5 was a winning move for Alex, so we return true.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\
  \n2 <= piles.length <= 500\npiles.length is even.\n1 <= piles[i] <= 500\nsum(piles)\
  \ is odd."
