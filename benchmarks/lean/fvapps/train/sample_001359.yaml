"vc-description": "Alice's school is planning to take some students from her class\
  \ on a field trip. Alice is really excited about it. There are a total of S students\
  \ in her class. But due to budget constraints, the school is planning to take only\
  \ N students for the trip. These students will be picked randomly. And each student\
  \ has equal chance of being picked.\nAlice's friend circle has M students including\
  \ her. Though she is excited about the field trip, she will enjoy it only if there\
  \ are atleast K of her friends with her on the trip. She is wondering what are the\
  \ chances of that happening. She needs your help. Tell her the probability that\
  \ she will enjoy given that she goes on the trip.\n\n-----Input:-----\nFirst line\
  \ of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.\n\nEach test starts\
  \ with a single line having 4 space separated integers, S, N, M and K.\n\n-----Output:-----\n\
  For each test case, output a line containing the required probability. The answer\
  \ will be accepted if the relative error is not more than 10-6.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n\
  1 ≤ T ≤ 100\n1 ≤ S ≤ 1000\n1 ≤ N ≤ S\n1 ≤ M ≤ S\n0 ≤ K < M\n\n-----Example:-----Input:\n\

  \ #1:\nEvery student will be taken to the trip. So all her 4 friends will accompany\
  \ her to the trip no matter what. \nCase #2:\nAlice wants 4 out of her 5 friends\
  \ to come along with her which isn't possible because the school is willing to pick\
  \ only 4 students for the trip."
