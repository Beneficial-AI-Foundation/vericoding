"vc-description": "Timothy (age: 16) really likes to smoke. Unfortunately, he is too\
  \ young to buy his own cigarettes and that's why he has to be extremely efficient\
  \ in smoking.\n\nIt's now your task to create a function that calculates how many\
  \ cigarettes Timothy can smoke out of the given amounts of `bars` and `boxes`:\n\
  \n- a bar has 10 boxes of cigarettes,\n- a box has 18 cigarettes,\n- out of 5 stubs\
  \ (cigarettes ends) Timothy is able to roll a new one,\n- of course the self made\
  \ cigarettes also have an end which can be used to create a new one...\n\nPlease\
  \ note that Timothy never starts smoking cigarettes that aren't \"full size\" so\
  \ the amount of smoked cigarettes is always an integer."
