"vc-description": "A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph, where an edge can\
  \ connect any number of vertices. A k-uniform hypergraph is a hypergraph such that\
  \ all its hyperedges have size k. For more information, see Wikipedia.\n\nLet's\
  \ call a particular hypergraph a hypertree if it is connected (that is, you can\
  \ move from any vertex to any other vertex using only its hyperedges) and removing\
  \ any of its hyperedges makes the hypergraph disconnected (note that this definition\
  \ of hypertrees differs from the standard one).\n\nGiven just one integer N, find\
  \ the number of 3-uniform hypertrees on N vertices. Two 3-uniform hypertrees are\
  \ considered different if a hyperedge (u, v, w) exists such that it is present in\
  \ exactly one of these hypertrees (note that the order of vertices in the hyperedge\
  \ doesn't matter, and neither does the order of hyperedges in the hypertree).\n\n\
  -----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T -- the number\
  \ of test cases (at most 15). Then T lines follow, each contains an integer N (3\
  \ ≤ N ≤ 17).\n\nImportant! Please include all code used in solving this problem\
  \ in your solution.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case output one line containing\
  \ the requested number. It's guaranteed that this number won't exceed 263-1.\n\n\
  -----Examples-----\nInput:\n4\n3\n4\n5\n8\n\nOutput:\n1\n6\n25\n93268\n\nExplanation:\n\
  There is just one 3-uniform hypertree on 3 vertices: {(1,2,3)}. There are six of\
  \ them on 4 vertices: {(1,2,3), (1,2,4)}, {(1,2,3), (1,3,4)}, {(1,2,3), (2,3,4)},\
  \ {(1,2,4), (1,3,4)}, {(1,2,4), (2,3,4)}, {(1,3,4), (2,3,4)}. Two of the 25 possible\
  \ hypertrees on 5 vertices are {(1,2,3), (3,4,5)} and {(1,2,3), (1,2,4), (1,2,5)}."
