"vc-description": "You are given an empty grid with $N$ rows (numbered $1$ through\
  \ $N$) and $M$ columns (numbered $1$ through $M$). You should fill this grid with\
  \ integers in a way that satisfies the following rules:\n- For any three cells $c_1$,\
  \ $c_2$ and $c_3$ such that $c_1$ shares a side with $c_2$ and another side with\
  \ $c_3$, the integers written in cells $c_2$ and $c_3$ are distinct.\n- Let's denote\
  \ the number of different integers in the grid by $K$; then, each of these integers\
  \ should lie between $1$ and $K$ inclusive.\n- $K$ should be minimum possible.\n\
  Find the minimum value of $K$ and a resulting (filled) grid. If there are multiple\
  \ solutions, you may find any one.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input\
  \ contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description\
  \ of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains\
  \ two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.\n\n-----Output-----\n- For each test\
  \ case, print $N+1$ lines.\n- The first line should contain a single integer — the\
  \ minimum $K$.\n- Each of the following $N$ lines should contain $M$ space-separated\
  \ integers between $1$ and $K$ inclusive. For each valid $i, j$, the $j$-th integer\
  \ on the $i$-th line should denote the number in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column\
  \ of the grid.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 500$\n- $1 \\le N, M \\\
  le 50$\n- the sum of $N \\cdot M$ over all test cases does not exceed $7 \\cdot\
  \ 10^5$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n\
  -----Example Input-----\n2\n1 1\n2 3\n\n-----Example Output-----\n1\n1\n3\n1 1 2\n\
  2 3 3\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: There is only one cell in the grid,\
  \ so the only valid way to fill it is to write $1$ in this cell. Note that we cannot\
  \ use any other integer than $1$.\nExample case 2: For example, the integers written\
  \ in the neighbours of cell $(2, 2)$ are $1$, $2$ and $3$; all these numbers are\
  \ pairwise distinct and the integer written inside the cell $(2, 2)$ does not matter.\
  \ Note that there are pairs of neighbouring cells with the same integer written\
  \ in them, but this is OK."
