"vc-description": "Apparently \"Put A Pillow On Your Fridge Day is celebrated on the\
  \ 29th of May each year, in Europe and the U.S. The day is all about prosperity,\
  \ good fortune, and having bit of fun along the way.\"\n\nAll seems very weird to\
  \ me.\n\nNevertheless, you will be given an array of two strings (s). First find\
  \ out if the first string contains a fridge... (i've deemed this as being 'n', as\
  \ it looks like it could hold something).\n\nThen check that the second string has\
  \ a pillow - deemed 'B' (struggled to get the obvious pillow-esque character).\n\
  \nIf the pillow is on top of the fridge - it must be May 29th! Or a weird house...\
  \ Return true; For clarity, on top means right on top, ie in the same index position.\n\
  \nIf the pillow is anywhere else in the 'house', return false;\n\nThere may be multiple\
  \ fridges, and multiple pillows. But you need at least 1 pillow ON TOP of a fridge\
  \ to return true. Multiple pillows on fridges should return true also.\n\n100 random\
