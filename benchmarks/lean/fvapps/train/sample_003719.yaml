"vc-description": "# Back-Story\n\nEvery day I travel on the freeway.\n\nWhen I am\
  \ more bored than usual I sometimes like to play the following counting game I made\
  \ up:\n\n* As I join the freeway my count is ```0```\n* Add ```1``` for every car\
  \ that I overtake\n* Subtract ```1``` for every car that overtakes me\n* Stop counting\
  \ when I reach my exit\n\nWhat an easy game! What fun!\n\n# Kata Task\n\nYou will\
  \ be given\n* The distance to my exit (km)\n* How fast I am going (kph)\n* Information\
  \ about a lot of other cars \n * Their time (relative to me) as I join the freeway.\
  \ For example,\n   * ```-1.5``` means they already passed my starting point ```1.5```\
  \ minutes ago\n   * ```2.2``` means they will pass my starting point ```2.2``` minutes\
  \ from now\n * How fast they are going (kph)\n\nFind what is my \"score\" as I exit\
  \ the freeway!\n\n# Notes\n\n* Assume all cars travel at a constant speeds\n\n Safety\
  \ Warning \n\nIf you plan to play this \"game\" remember that it is not really a\
  \ game. You are in a **real** car.\n\nThere may be a temptation to try to beat your\
  \ previous best score.\n\nPlease don't do that..."
