"vc-description": "You want to build a standard house of cards, but you don't know\
  \ how many cards you will need. Write a program which will count the minimal number\
  \ of cards according to the number of floors you want to have. For example, if you\
  \ want a one floor house, you will need 7 of them (two pairs of two cards on the\
  \ base floor, one horizontal card and one pair to get the first floor). Here you\
  \ can see which kind of house of cards I mean:\nhttp://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Tower-of-Cards\n\
  \n## Note about floors:\nThis kata uses the British numbering system for building\
  \ floors. If you want your house of cards to have a first floor, it needs a ground\
  \ floor and then a first floor above that.\n\n### Details (Ruby & JavaScript & Python\
  \ & R)\nThe input must be an integer greater than 0, for other input raise an error.\n\
  \n### Details (Haskell)\nThe input must be an integer greater than 0, for other\
  \ input return `Nothing`."
