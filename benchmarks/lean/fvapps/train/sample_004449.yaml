"vc-description": "The medians of a triangle are the segments that unit the vertices\
  \ with the midpoint of their opposite sides.\nThe three medians of a triangle intersect\
  \ at the same point, called the barycenter or the centroid.\nGiven a triangle, defined\
  \ by the cartesian coordinates of its vertices we need to localize its barycenter\
  \ or centroid.\n\nThe function ```bar_triang() or barTriang or bar-triang```, receives\
  \ the coordinates of the three vertices ```A, B and C ``` as three different arguments\
  \ and outputs the coordinates of the barycenter ```O``` in an array ```[xO, yO]```\n\
  \nThis is how our asked function should work:\nthe result of the coordinates should\
  \ be expressed up to four decimals, (rounded result).\n\nYou know that the coordinates\
  \ of the barycenter are given by the following formulas.\n\n\n\nFor additional information\
  \ about this important point of a triangle see at: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid)\n\
  \nLet's see some cases:\n```python\nbar_triang([4, 6], [12, 4], [10, 10]) ------>\
  \ [8.6667, 6.6667]\n\nbar_triang([4, 2], [12, 2], [6, 10] ------> [7.3333, 4.6667]\n\
  ```\nThe given points form a real or a degenerate triangle but in each case the\
  \ above formulas can be used.\n\nEnjoy it and happy coding!!"
