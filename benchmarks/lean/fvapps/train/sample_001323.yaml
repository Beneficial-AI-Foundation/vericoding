"vc-description": "Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore,\
  \ planning something particularly nefarious. Frustrated by his minions' incapability\
  \ which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier — a\
  \ machine which mutates minions.\n\nEach minion has an intrinsic characteristic\
  \ value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer\
  \ K to each of the minions' characteristic value. \n\nGru knows that if the new\
  \ characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like\
  \ mutations.\n\nGiven the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which\
  \ are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.\n\n\
  -----Input Format:-----\nThe first line contains one integer, T, which is the number\
  \ of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines.\nThe first line\
  \ contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement.\nThe next line contains\
  \ N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions.\n\n\
  -----Output Format:-----\nFor each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which\
  \ is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n\
  - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100\n- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100\n- 1 ≤ K ≤ 100\n- All initial characteristic values\
  \ lie between 1 and 105, both inclusive.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n1\n5 10\n\
  2 4 1 35 1\n\nOutput:\n1\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nAfter transmogrification, the\
  \ characteristic values become {12,14,11,45,11}, out of which only 14 is divisible\
  \ by 7. So only the second minion becomes Wolverine-like."
