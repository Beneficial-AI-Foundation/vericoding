"vc-description": "# It's too hot, and they can't even…\n\nOne hot summer day Pete\
  \ and his friend Billy decided to buy watermelons. They chose the biggest crate.\
  \ They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide their loot, however they\
  \ faced a hard problem.\n\nPete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's\
  \ why they want to divide the number of watermelons in such a way that each of the\
  \ two parts consists of an even number of watermelons. However, it is not obligatory\
  \ that the parts are equal. \n\nExample: the boys can divide a stack of 8 watermelons\
  \ into 2+6 melons, or 4+4 melons.\n\nThe boys are extremely tired and want to start\
  \ their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out,\
  \ whether they can divide the fruits in the way they want. For sure, each of them\
  \ should get a part of positive weight.\n\n# Task\nGiven an integral number of watermelons\
  \ `w` (`1 ≤ w ≤ 100`; `1 ≤ w` in Haskell), check whether Pete and Billy can divide\
  \ the melons so that each of them gets an even amount.\n\n## Examples"
