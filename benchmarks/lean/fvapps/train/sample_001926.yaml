"vc-description": "Eighth-grader Vova is on duty today in the class. After classes,\
  \ he went into the office to wash the board, and found on it the number n. He asked\
  \ what is this number and the teacher of mathematics Inna Petrovna answered Vova\
  \ that n is the answer to the arithmetic task for first-graders. In the textbook,\
  \ a certain positive integer x was given. The task was to add x to the sum of the\
  \ digits of the number x written in decimal numeral system.\n\nSince the number\
  \ n on the board was small, Vova quickly guessed which x could be in the textbook.\
  \ Now he wants to get a program which will search for arbitrary values of the number\
  \ n for all suitable values of x or determine that such x does not exist. Write\
  \ such a program for Vova.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer\
  \ n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print one integer\
  \ k — number of different values of x satisfying the condition. \n\nIn next k lines\
  \ print these values in ascending order.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n21\n\n\
  Output\n1\n15\n\nInput\n20\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test\
  \ case x = 15 there is only one variant: 15 + 1 + 5 = 21.\n\nIn the second test\
  \ case there are no such x."
