"vc-description": "\"How did you get the deal,how did he agree?\"\n\"Its's simple\
  \ Tom I just made him an offer he couldn't refuse\" \nAyush is the owner of a big\
  \ construction company and a close aide of Don Vito The Godfather, recently with\
  \ the help of the Godfather his company has been assigned a big contract according\
  \ to the contract he has to make n number of V shaped infinitely long roads(two\
  \ V shaped roads may or  not intersect) on an infinitely large field.\nNow the company\
  \ assigning the contract needs to know the maximum number of regions they can get\
  \ after making n such roads.\nHelp Ayush by answering the above question.\n\n-----Input:-----\n\
  - The first line consists of the number of test cases $T$. \n- Next T lines consists\
  \ of the number of V shaped roads $n$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case\
  \ print a single line consisting of the maximum regions obtained.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n\
  - $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n\
  1\n2\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n2\n7\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nTest case 1: \
  \      For one V shaped road there will be 2 regions\n\nTest case 2:       For n=2\
  \ the following figure depicts the case of maximum regions:"
