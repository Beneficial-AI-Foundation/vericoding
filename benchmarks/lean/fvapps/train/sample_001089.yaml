  "How did you get the deal,how did he agree?"
  "Its's simple Tom I just made him an offer he couldn't refuse" 
  Ayush is the owner of a big construction company and a close aide of Don Vito The Godfather, recently with the help of the Godfather his company has been assigned a big contract according to the contract he has to make n number of V shaped infinitely long roads(two V shaped roads may or  not intersect) on an infinitely large field.
  Now the company assigning the contract needs to know the maximum number of regions they can get after making n such roads.
  Help Ayush by answering the above question.

  -----Input:-----
  - The first line consists of the number of test cases $T$. 
  - Next T lines consists of the number of V shaped roads $n$.

  -----Output:-----
  For each test case print a single line consisting of the maximum regions obtained.

  -----Constraints-----
  - $1 \leq T \leq 10$
  - $1 \leq n \leq 10^9$

  -----Sample Input:-----
  2
  1
  2

  -----Sample Output:-----
  2
  7

  -----EXPLANATION:-----
  Test case 1:       For one V shaped road there will be 2 regions

  Test case 2:       For n=2 the following figure depicts the case of maximum regions:
