vc-description: |-
  You are the judge at a competitive eating competition and you need to choose a winner!

  There are three foods at the competition and each type of food is worth a different amount of points.
  Points are as follows:

  - Chickenwings: 5 points  

  - Hamburgers: 3 points   

  - Hotdogs: 2 points

  Write a function that helps you create a scoreboard. 
  It takes as a parameter a list of objects representing the participants, for example:
  ```
  [
    {name: "Habanero Hillary", chickenwings: 5 , hamburgers: 17, hotdogs: 11},
    {name: "Big Bob" , chickenwings: 20, hamburgers: 4, hotdogs: 11}
  ]
  ```
  It should return 
  "name" and "score" properties sorted by score; if scores are equals, sort alphabetically by name.
  ```
  [
    {name: "Big Bob", score: 134},
    {name: "Habanero Hillary", score: 98}
  ]
  ```
  Happy judging!
