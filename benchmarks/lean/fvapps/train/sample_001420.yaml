"vc-description": "$Neha$  is given a number $N$. She always looks for special thing\
  \ , this time she is looking for $Special$ $Number$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Number$.\
  \ A $Special$ $Number$ is a number whose product of its digits is equal to number\
  \ itself i.e. $N $, and in this number there is no digit $1$. $Partial$ $Special$\
  \ is a number having all the condition same as $Special$ except that it can also\
  \ have digit $1$ in it .Neha have to count the number of $Special$ and $Partial$\
  \ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given  $N$ . She is not so good in programming , so\
  \ go and help her.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- Integers $N$ is taken as input from input\
  \ stream. \n\n-----Output:-----\n- Print the number of  $Special$ and $Partial$\
  \ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given  $N$.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\\
  leq 100$ numbers to be count will be less then 10^6\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n\
  3\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n1 20\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nThere are only one\
  \ natural numbers, the product of the digits of which is 3  :- {3}.\nThere are 20\
  \ natural numbers with digit 1 , whose  product of the digits  is 3 :-{13, 31, 113\
  \ ,131 311 ,1113 ,1131 ,1311, 3111 ,11113, 11131, 11311 ,13111, 31111, 111113, 111131,\
