"vc-description": "## The galactic games have begun!\n\nIt's the galactic games! Beings\
  \ of all worlds come together to compete in several interesting sports, like nroogring,\
  \ fredling and buzzing (the beefolks love the last one). However, there's also the\
  \ traditional marathon run.\n\nUnfortunately, there have been cheaters in the last\
  \ years, and the committee decided to place sensors on the track. Committees being\
  \ committees, they've come up with the following rule:\n\n> A sensor should be placed\
  \ every 3 and 5 meters from the start, e.g.\n> at 3m, 5m, 6m, 9m, 10m, 12m, 15m,\
  \ 18m….\n\nSince you're responsible for the track, you need to buy those sensors.\
  \ Even worse, you don't know how long the track will be! And since there might be\
  \ more than a single track, and you can't be bothered to do all of this by hand,\
  \ you decide to write a program instead.\n\n## Task\nReturn the sum of the multiples\
  \ of 3 and 5 __below__ a number. Being the _galactic_ games, the tracks can get\
  \ rather large, so your solution should work for _really_ large numbers (greater\
  \ than 1,000,000).\n\n### Examples\n```python\nsolution (10) # => 23 = 3 + 5 + 6\
  \ + 9\nsolution (20) # => 78 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18\n```"
