"vc-description": "You are an all-powerful being and you have created a rectangular\
  \ world. In fact, your world is so bland that it could be represented by a $r \\\
  times c$ grid. Each cell on the grid represents a country. Each country has a dominant\
  \ religion. There are only two religions in your world. One of the religions is\
  \ called Beingawesomeism, who do good for the sake of being good. The other religion\
  \ is called Pushingittoofarism, who do murders for the sake of being bad.\n\nOh,\
  \ and you are actually not really all-powerful. You just have one power, which you\
  \ can use infinitely many times! Your power involves missionary groups. When a missionary\
  \ group of a certain country, say $a$, passes by another country $b$, they change\
  \ the dominant religion of country $b$ to the dominant religion of country $a$.\n\
  \nIn particular, a single use of your power is this:   You choose a horizontal $1\
  \ \\times x$ subgrid or a vertical $x \\times 1$ subgrid. That value of $x$ is up\
  \ to you;  You choose a direction $d$. If you chose a horizontal subgrid, your choices\
  \ will either be NORTH or SOUTH. If you choose a vertical subgrid, your choices\
  \ will either be EAST or WEST;  You choose the number $s$ of steps;  You command\
  \ each country in the subgrid to send a missionary group that will travel $s$ steps\
  \ towards direction $d$. In each step, they will visit (and in effect convert the\
  \ dominant religion of) all $s$ countries they pass through, as detailed above.\
  \  The parameters $x$, $d$, $s$ must be chosen in such a way that any of the missionary\
  \ groups won't leave the grid. \n\nThe following image illustrates one possible\
  \ single usage of your power. Here, A represents a country with dominant religion\
  \ Beingawesomeism and P represents a country with dominant religion Pushingittoofarism.\
  \ Here, we've chosen a $1 \\times 4$ subgrid, the direction NORTH, and $s = 2$ steps.\
  \  [Image] \n\nYou are a being which believes in free will, for the most part. However,\
  \ you just really want to stop receiving murders that are attributed to your name.\
  \ Hence, you decide to use your powers and try to make Beingawesomeism the dominant\
  \ religion in every country.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of usages of your power\
  \ needed to convert everyone to Beingawesomeism?\n\nWith god, nothing is impossible.\
  \ But maybe you're not god? If it is impossible to make Beingawesomeism the dominant\
  \ religion in all countries, you must also admit your mortality and say so.\n\n\n\
  -----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\\
  le t \\le 2\\cdot 10^4$) denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of\
  \ each test case contains two space-separated integers $r$ and $c$ denoting the\
  \ dimensions of the grid ($1 \\le r, c \\le 60$). The next $r$ lines each contains\
  \ $c$ characters describing the dominant religions in the countries. In particular,\
  \ the $j$-th character in the $i$-th line describes the dominant religion in the\
  \ country at the cell with row $i$ and column $j$, where:  \"A\" means that the\
  \ dominant religion is Beingawesomeism;  \"P\" means that the dominant religion\
  \ is Pushingittoofarism. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the grid will only contain \"\
  A\" or \"P\" characters. It is guaranteed that the sum of the $r \\cdot c$ in a\
  \ single file is at most $3 \\cdot 10^6$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test\
  \ case, output a single line containing the minimum number of usages of your power\
  \ needed to convert everyone to Beingawesomeism, or the string \"MORTAL\" (without\
  \ quotes) if it is impossible to do so. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n7 8\n\
  AAPAAAAA\nPPPPAAAA\nPPPPAAAA\nAPAAPPPP\nAPAPPAPP\nAAAAPPAP\nAAAAPPAA\n6 5\nAAAAA\n\
  AAAAA\nAAPAA\nAAPAP\nAAAPP\nAAAPP\n4 4\nPPPP\nPPPP\nPPPP\nPPPP\n3 4\nPPPP\nPAAP\n\
  PPPP\n\nOutput\n2\n1\nMORTAL\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case,\
  \ it can be done in two usages, as follows:\n\nUsage 1: [Image] \n\nUsage 2: [Image]\
  \ \n\nIn the second test case, it can be done with just one usage of the power.\
  \ \n\nIn the third test case, it is impossible to convert everyone to Beingawesomeism,\
  \ so the answer is \"MORTAL\"."
