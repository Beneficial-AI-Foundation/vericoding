"vc-description": "Learning to code around your full time job is taking over your\
  \ life. You realise that in order to make significant steps quickly, it would help\
  \ to go to a coding bootcamp in London.\n\nProblem is, many of them cost a fortune,\
  \ and those that don't still involve a significant amount of time off work - who\
  \ will pay your mortgage?!\n\nTo offset this risk, you decide that rather than leaving\
  \ work totally, you will request a sabbatical so that you can go back to work post\
  \ bootcamp and be paid while you look for your next role.\n\nYou need to approach\
  \ your boss. Her decision will be based on three parameters:\n\nval=your value to\
  \ the organisation\nhappiness=her happiness level at the time of asking and finally\n\
  The numbers of letters from 'sabbatical' that are present in string `s`.\n\nNote\
  \ that if `s` contains three instances of the letter 'l', that still scores three\
  \ points, even though there is only one in the word sabbatical.\n\nIf the sum of\
  \ the three parameters (as described above) is > 22, return 'Sabbatical! Boom!',\
  \ else return 'Back to your desk, boy.'.\n\n~~~if:c\nNOTE: For the C translation\
  \ you should return a string literal.\n~~~"
