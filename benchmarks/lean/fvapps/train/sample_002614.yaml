"vc-description": "We are given a sequence of coplanar points and see all the possible\
  \ triangles that may be generated which all combinations of three points.\n\nWe\
  \ have the following list of points with the cartesian coordinates of each one:\n\
  ```\nPoints [x, y]\n   A   [1, 2]\n   B   [3, 3]\n   C   [4, 1]\n   D   [1, 1]\n\
  \   E   [4, -1]\n```\nWith these points we may have the following triangles: ```ABC,\
  \ ABD, ABE, ACD, ACE, ADE, BCD, BCE, BDE, CDE.``` There are three special ones:\
  \ ```ABC, ACD and CDE```, that have an angle of 90°. All is shown in the picture\
  \ below:\n\n\n\nWe need to count all the rectangle triangles that may be formed\
  \ by a given list of points.\n\nThe case decribed above will be:\n```python\ncount_rect_triang([[1,\
  \ 2],[3, 3],[4, 1],[1, 1],[4, -1]]) == 3\n```\n\nObserve this case:\n```python\n\
  count_rect_triang([[1, 2],[4, -1],[3, 3],[4, -1],[4, 1],[1, 1],[4, -1], [4, -1],\
  \ [3, 3], [1, 2]]) == 3\n```\nIf no rectangle triangles may be generated the function\
  \ will output ```0```.\n\nEnjoy it!"
