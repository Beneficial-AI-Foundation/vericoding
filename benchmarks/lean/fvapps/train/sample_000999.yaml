"vc-description": "Let's consider a rooted binary tree with the following properties:\n\
  - The number of nodes and edges in the tree is infinite\n- The tree root is labeled\
  \ by $1$\n- A node labeled by $v$ has two children: $2 \\cdot v$ (the left child\
  \ of $v$), and $2 \\cdot v + 1$ (the right child of $v$).\nHere is an image of the\
  \ first several layers of such a tree:\n\nLet's consider four operations that you\
  \ are allowed to apply during the tree traversal:\n- move to the left child - move\
  \ from $v$ to $2 \\cdot v$\n- move to the right child - move from $v$ to $2 \\cdot\
  \ v + 1$\n- move to the parent as a left child - move from $v$ to $\\frac{v}{2}$\
  \ if $v$ is an even integer\n- move to the parent as a right child - move from $v$\
  \ to $\\frac{v - 1}{2}$ if $v$ is an odd integer\nIt can be proven, that for any\
  \ pair of nodes $u$ and $v$, there is only one sequence of commands that moves from\
  \ $u$ to $v$ and visits each node of the tree at most once. Let's call such a sequence\
  \ of commands a path configuration for a pair of nodes $(u, v)$.\nYou are asked\
  \ to process a series of the following queries: \nYou are given three integers $n$,\
  \ $u$ and $v$ ($1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$). Count the pairs of nodes $(w, t)$ ($1 \\\
  leq w, t \\leq n$) such that the path configuration for $(w, t)$ is the same with\
  \ the path configuration for $(u, v)$.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of input\
  \ contains a single integer $Q$, denoting the number of queries to process.\n- Each\
  \ of the next $Q$ lines contains three space-separated integers $n$, $u$ and $v$\
  \ denoting a query.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each query, print the answer on a separate\
  \ line.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$\n- $1 \\leq\
  \ u, v \\leq n \\leq 10^{9}$\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\n11 9 11\n10 2 2\n8 1\
  \ 8\n\n-----Example Output-----\n2\n10\n1\n\n-----Explanation-----\nIn the first\
  \ query from the example test case, you should count pairs $(5, 7)$ and $(9, 11)$.\n\
  In the second query from the example test case, you should count the following pairs:\
  \ $(1, 1)$, $(2, 2)$, $(3, 3)$, $(4, 4)$, $(5, 5)$, $(6, 6)$, $(7, 7)$, $(8, 8)$,\
  \ $(9, 9)$ and $(10, 10)$.\nIn the third query from the example test case, you should\
  \ only count a pair $(1, 8)$."
