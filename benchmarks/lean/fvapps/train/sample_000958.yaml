"vc-description": "Back in 2015, Usain Bolt announced that he'll be retiring after\
  \ the 2017 World Championship. Though his final season did not end gloriously, we\
  \ all know that he is a true legend and we witnessed his peak during 2008 - 2013.\
  \ \nPost retirement, Usain Bolt is still leading an adventurous life. He's exploring\
  \ the unexplored parts of the globe. But sometimes he gets bored, and reads questions\
  \ asked about him on Quora. One such question he read was, \"Who would win a race\
  \ between Usain Bolt and a tiger if the race is on a straight line track and the\
  \ tiger is $distancetoBolt$ meters behind Bolt? The finishing point is $finish$\
  \ meters away from Bolt's starting position. The tiger starts with an initial speed\
  \ of $0$ $meter/second$, and will accelerate itself with $tigerAccelaration$ $m/s^2$.\
  \ Bolt can run with a constant speed of $boltSpeed$ $m/s$ from start to finish.\
  \ Given these values, find out who will win the race - Bolt or the tiger? \"\nNote\
  \ that Bolt will win the race if and only if he touches the finishing line before\
  \ the tiger touches it. If both of them finish together, the tiger is announced\
  \ as the winner since Bolt was given an initial advantage. See the figure below\
  \ for more clarity.\n\nSince Bolt was busy practicing in the tracks during his Physics\
  \ school classes, he is asking for your help to solve the question. Can you please\
  \ help him?\nHe just remembers two formulae from the class, and thinks that they\
  \ will be useful to you:\n$Displacement (S) $ = $ut$ +$ (1/2)at^2$ where $u$ is\
  \ the initial velocity , #$ $is the acceleration and $t$ is the time taken.\n$Velocity$\
  \ = $Displacement /Time$\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line will contain $T$,\
  \ the number of testcases. Then the description of each test case follow. \n- Each\
  \ test case contains 4 integers $finish, distancetoBolt, tigerAccelaration, boltSpeed$.\
  \ \n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, output in a single line, the word \"\
  Bolt\" or \"Tiger\" without quotes, depending on whether Bolt wins or the tiger\
  \ wins.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100000$\n- $1 \\leq finish\\\
  leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq distancetoBolt\\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq tigerAccelaration\\\
  leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq boltSpeed\\leq 10^5$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n10 100\
