"vc-description": "There were $N$ students (numbered $1$ through $N$) participating\
  \ in the Indian Programming Camp (IPC) and they watched a total of $K$ lectures\
  \ (numbered $1$ through $K$). For each student $i$ and each lecture $j$, the $i$-th\
  \ student watched the $j$-th lecture for $T_{i, j}$ minutes.\nAdditionally, for\
  \ each student $i$, we know that this student asked the question, \"What is the\
  \ criteria for getting a certificate?\" $Q_i$ times.\nThe criteria for getting a\
  \ certificate is that a student must have watched at least $M$ minutes of lectures\
  \ in total and they must have asked the question no more than $10$ times.\nFind\
  \ out how many participants are eligible for a certificate.\n\n-----Input-----\n\
  - The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers $N$, $M$ and\
  \ $K$.\n- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains\
  \ $K+1$ space-separated integers $T_{i, 1}, T_{i, 2}, \\ldots, T_{i, K}, Q_i$.\n\
  \n-----Output-----\nPrint a single line containing one integer — the number of participants\
  \ eligible for a certificate. \n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le N, K \\le 1,000$\n\
  - $1 \\le M \\le 10^6$\n- $1 \\le Q_i \\le 10^6$ for each valid $i$\n- $1 \\le T_{i,\
  \ j} \\le 1,000$ for each valid $i$ and $j$\n\n-----Example Input-----\n4 8 4\n\
  1 2 1 2 5\n3 5 1 3 4\n1 2 4 5 11\n1 1 1 3 12\n\n-----Example Output-----\n1\n\n\
  -----Explanation-----\n- Participant $1$ watched $1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6$ minutes of\
  \ lectures and asked the question $5$ times. Since $6 < M$, this participant does\
  \ not receive a certificate.\n- Participant $2$ watched $3 + 5 + 1 + 3 = 12$ minutes\
  \ of lectures and asked the question $4$ times. Since $12 \\ge M$ and $4 \\le 10$,\
  \ this participant receives a certificate.\n- Participant $3$ watched $1 + 2 + 4\
  \ + 5 = 12$ minutes of lectures and asked the question $11$ times. Since $12 \\\
  ge M$ but $11 > 10$, this participant does not receive a certificate.\n- Participant\
  \ $4$ watched $1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6$ minutes of lectures and asked the question $12$\
  \ times. Since $6 < M$ and $12 > 10$, this participant does not receive a certificate.\n\
  Only participant $2$ receives a certificate."
