"vc-description": "Soma is a fashionable girl. She absolutely loves shiny stones that\
  \ she can put on as jewellery accessories. She has been collecting stones since\
  \ her childhood - now she has become really good with identifying which ones are\
  \ fake and which ones are not.  Her King requested for her help in mining precious\
  \ stones, so she has told him which all stones are jewels and which are not. Given\
  \ her description, your task is  to count the number of jewel stones. \n\nMore formally,\
  \ you're given a string J composed of latin characters where each character is a\
  \ jewel. You're also given a string S composed of latin characters where each character\
  \ is a mined stone. You have to find out how many characters of S are in J as well.\
  \ \n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line contains an integer T denoting the number of\
  \ test cases. Then follow T test cases. Each test case consists of two lines, each\
  \ of which contains a string composed of English lower case and upper characters.\
  \ First of these is the jewel string J and the second one is stone string S. \n\
  You can assume that  1 <= T <= 100, 1 <= |J|, |S| <= 100\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\
  Output for each test case, a single integer, the number of jewels mined. \n\n-----Example-----\n\
