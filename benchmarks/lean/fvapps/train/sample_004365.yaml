"vc-description": "Ronald's uncle left him 3 fertile chickens in his will. When life\
  \ gives you chickens, you start a business selling chicken eggs which is exactly\
  \ what Ronald decided to do. \n\nA chicken lays 300 eggs in its first year. However,\
  \ each chicken's egg production decreases by 20% every following year (rounded down)\
  \ until when it dies (after laying its quota of eggs). \n\nAfter his first successful\
  \ year of business, Ronald decides to buy 3 more chickens at the start of each year.\
  \  \n\n\nYour Task: \n\nFor a given year, and life span of chicken span,  calculate\
  \ how many eggs Ronald's chickens will lay him that year, whereby year=1 is when\
  \ Ronald first got his inheritance and span>0.\n\nIf year=0, make sure to return\
  \ \"No chickens yet!\".\n\n\nNote: \n1. All chickens have the same life span regardless\
  \ of when they are bought. \n2. Let's assume all calculations are made at the end\
  \ of the year so don't bother taking eggs laid per month into consideration. \n\
  3. Each chicken's egg production goes down by 20% each year, NOT the total number\
  \ of eggs produced by each 'batch' of chickens. While this might appear to be the\
  \ same thing, it doesn't once non-integers come into play so take care that this\
  \ is reflected in your kata!"
