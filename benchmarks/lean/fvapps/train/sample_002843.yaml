"vc-description": "The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle base on the American\
  \ TV show \"Let's Make A Deal\".\n\nIn this show, you would be presented with 3\
  \ doors: One with a prize behind it, and two without (represented with goats).\n\
  \nAfter choosing a door, the host would open one of the other two doors which didn't\
  \ include a prize, and ask the participant if he or she wanted to switch to the\
  \ third door. Most wouldn't. One would think you have a fifty-fifty chance of winning\
  \ after having been shown a false door, however the math proves that you significantly\
  \ increase your chances, from 1/3 to 2/3 by switching.\n\nFurther information about\
  \ this puzzle can be found on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem.\n\
  \nIn this program you are given an array of people who have all guessed on a door\
  \ from 1-3, as well as given the door which includes the price. You need to make\
  \ every person switch to the other door, and increase their chances of winning.\
  \ Return the win percentage (as a rounded int) of all participants."
