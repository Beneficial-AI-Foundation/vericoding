"vc-description": "You're going on a trip with some students and it's up to you to\
  \ keep track of how much money each Student has. A student is defined like this:\n\
  \n```python\nclass Student:\n    def __init__(self, name, fives, tens, twenties):\n\
  \        self.name = name\n        self.fives = fives\n        self.tens = tens\n\
  \        self.twenties = twenties\n```\n\nAs you can tell, each Student has some\
  \ fives, tens, and twenties. Your job is to return the name of the student with\
  \ the most money. If every student has the same amount, then return `\"all\"`.\n\
  \nNotes:\n* Each student will have a unique name\n* There will always be a clear\
  \ winner: either one person has the most, or everyone has the same amount\n* If\
  \ there is only one student, then that student has the most money"
