"vc-description": "The biggest event of the year – Cota 2 world championship \"The\
  \ Innernational\" is right around the corner. $2^n$ teams will compete in a double-elimination\
  \ format (please, carefully read problem statement even if you know what is it)\
  \ to identify the champion. \n\nTeams are numbered from $1$ to $2^n$ and will play\
  \ games one-on-one. All teams start in the upper bracket.\n\nAll upper bracket matches\
  \ will be held played between teams that haven't lost any games yet. Teams are split\
  \ into games by team numbers. Game winner advances in the next round of upper bracket,\
  \ losers drop into the lower bracket.\n\nLower bracket starts with $2^{n-1}$ teams\
  \ that lost the first upper bracket game. Each lower bracket round consists of two\
  \ games. In the first game of a round $2^k$ teams play a game with each other (teams\
  \ are split into games by team numbers). $2^{k-1}$ loosing teams are eliminated\
  \ from the championship, $2^{k-1}$ winning teams are playing $2^{k-1}$ teams that\
  \ got eliminated in this round of upper bracket (again, teams are split into games\
  \ by team numbers). As a result of each round both upper and lower bracket have\
  \ $2^{k-1}$ teams remaining. See example notes for better understanding.\n\nSingle\
  \ remaining team of upper bracket plays with single remaining team of lower bracket\
  \ in grand-finals to identify championship winner.\n\nYou are a fan of teams with\
  \ numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$. You want the championship to have as many games\
  \ with your favourite teams as possible. Luckily, you can affect results of every\
  \ championship game the way you want. What's maximal possible number of championship\
  \ games that include teams you're fan of?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst input line\
  \ has two integers $n, k$ — $2^n$ teams are competing in the championship. You are\
  \ a fan of $k$ teams ($2 \\le n \\le 17; 0 \\le k \\le 2^n$).\n\nSecond input line\
  \ has $k$ distinct integers $a_1, \\ldots, a_k$ — numbers of teams you're a fan\
  \ of ($1 \\le a_i \\le 2^n$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput single integer — maximal\
  \ possible number of championship games that include teams you're fan of.\n\n\n\
  -----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n6\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n3 3\n1 7 8\n\nOutput\n\
  11\n\nInput\n3 4\n1 3 5 7\n\nOutput\n14\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nOn the image, each\
  \ game of the championship is denoted with an English letter ($a$ to $n$). Winner\
  \ of game $i$ is denoted as $Wi$, loser is denoted as $Li$. Teams you're a fan of\
  \ are highlighted with red background.\n\nIn the first example, team $6$ will play\
  \ in 6 games if it looses the first upper bracket game (game $c$) and wins all lower\
  \ bracket games (games $h, j, l, m$). [Image]\n\nIn the second example, teams $7$\
  \ and $8$ have to play with each other in the first game of upper bracket (game\
  \ $d$). Team $8$ can win all remaining games in upper bracket, when teams $1$ and\
  \ $7$ will compete in the lower bracket. [Image]\n\nIn the third example, your favourite\
  \ teams can play in all games of the championship. [Image]"
