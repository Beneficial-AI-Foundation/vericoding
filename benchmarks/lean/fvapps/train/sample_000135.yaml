"vc-description": "Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following\
  \ operations any number of times:\n\nChange the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary\
  \ representation of n.\nChange the ith bit in the binary representation of n if\
  \ the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.\n\n\
  Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.\n \nExample 1:\n\
  Input: n = 0\nOutput: 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The\
  \ binary representation of 3 is \"11\".\n\"11\" -> \"01\" with the 2nd operation\
  \ since the 0th bit is 1.\n\"01\" -> \"00\" with the 1st operation.\n\nExample 3:\n\
  Input: n = 6\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The binary representation of 6 is \"110\"\
  .\n\"110\" -> \"010\" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through\
  \ 0th bits are 0.\n\"010\" -> \"011\" with the 1st operation.\n\"011\" -> \"001\"\
