"vc-description": "**Introduction**\n Little Petya very much likes sequences. However,\
  \ recently he received a sequence as a gift from his mother.\n Petya didn't like\
  \ it at all! He decided to make a single replacement. After this replacement, Petya\
  \ would like to the sequence in increasing order.\n He asks himself: What is the\
  \ lowest possible value I could have got after making the replacement and sorting\
  \ the sequence?\n\n**About the replacement**\n Choose exactly one element from the\
  \ sequence and replace it with another integer > 0. You are **not allowed** to replace\
  \ a number with itself, or to change no number at all.\n\n**Task**\n Find the lowest\
  \ possible sequence after performing a valid replacement, and sorting the sequence.\n\
  \n**Input:**\n Input contains sequence with `N` integers. All elements of the sequence\
  \ > 0. The sequence will never be empty.\n\n**Output:**\n Return sequence with `N`\
  \ integers — which includes the lowest possible values of each sequence element,\
  \ after the single replacement and sorting has been performed.\n\n**Examples**:\n\
  ```\n([1,2,3,4,5])  =>  [1,1,2,3,4]\n([4,2,1,3,5])  =>  [1,1,2,3,4]\n([2,3,4,5,6])\
  \  =>  [1,2,3,4,5]\n([2,2,2])      =>  [1,2,2]\n([42])         =>  [1]\n```"
