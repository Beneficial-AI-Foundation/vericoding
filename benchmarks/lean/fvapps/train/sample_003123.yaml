"vc-description": "We all love the future president (or Führer or duce or sōtō as\
  \ he could find them more fitting) donald trump, but we might fear that some of\
  \ his many fans like John Miller or John Barron are not making him justice, sounding\
  \ too much like their (and our as well, of course!) hero and thus risking to compromise\
  \ him.\n\nFor this reason we need to create a function to detect the original and\
  \ unique rythm of our beloved leader, typically having a lot of extra vowels, all\
  \ ready to fight the estabilishment.\n\nThe index is calculated based on how many\
  \ vowels are repeated more than once in a row and dividing them by the total number\
  \ of vowels a petty enemy of America would use.\n\nFor example:\n```python\ntrump_detector(\"\
  I will build a huge wall\")==0 #definitely not our trump: 0 on the trump score\n\
  trump_detector(\"HUUUUUGEEEE WAAAAAALL\")==4 #4 extra \"U\", 3 extra \"E\" and 5\
  \ extra \"A\" on 3 different vowel groups: 12/3 make for a trumpy trumping score\
  \ of 4: not bad at all!\ntrump_detector(\"listen migrants: IIII KIIIDD YOOOUUU NOOOOOOTTT\"\
  )==1.56 #14 extra vowels on 9 base ones\n```\n**Notes:** vowels are only the ones\
  \ in the patriotic group of \"aeiou\": \"y\" should go back to Greece if she thinks\
  \ she can have the same rights of true American vowels; there is always going to\
  \ be at least a vowel, as silence is the option of coward Kenyan/terrorist presidents\
  \ and their friends.\n\nRound each result by two decimal digits: there is no place\
  \ for small fry in Trump's America.\n\n*Special thanks for [Izabela](https://www.codewars.com/users/ijelonek)\
