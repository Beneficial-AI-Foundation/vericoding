"vc-description": "The median of a sequence is the element in the middle of the sequence\
  \ after it is sorted. For a sequence with even size, the median is the average of\
  \ the two middle elements of the sequence after sorting. For example, for a sequence\
  \ $A = [1, 3, 3, 5, 4, 7, 11]$, the median is equal to $4$, and for $A = [2, 3,\
  \ 4, 5]$, the median is equal to $(3+4)/2 = 3.5$.\nFulu is a famous programmer in\
  \ his country. He wrote the following program (given in pseudocode) for finding\
  \ the median in a sequence $A$ with length $N$:\nread(N)\nread(A[0], A[1], ...,\
  \ A[N-1])\nsort(A)\n# simultaneously remove elements A[K] and A[N mod K] from the\
  \ array A\n# the order of the remaining N-2 elements is unchanged\nremove(A[K],\
  \ A[N mod K])\nreturn A[(N-2)/2] # integer division\n\nThe program takes an integer\
  \ $K$ as a parameter. Fulu can choose this integer arbitrarily between $1$ and $N-1$\
  \ inclusive.\nLittle Lima, Fulu's friend, thinks Fulu's program is wrong (as always).\
  \ As finding one counterexample would be an easy task for Lima (he has already found\
  \ the sequence $A = [34, 23, 35, 514]$, which is a counterexample for any $K \\\
  le 3$), Lima decided to make hacking more interesting. Fulu should give him four\
  \ parameters $S, K, m, M$ (in addition to $N$) and Lima should find the lexicographically\
  \ smallest proper sequence $A$ with length $N$ as a counterexample.\nWe say that\
  \ a sequence $A$ with length $N$ ($0$-indexed) is proper if it satisfies the following\
  \ conditions:\n- it contains only positive integers\n- $A_0 + A_1 +A_2 + \\dots\
  \ + A_{N-1} = S$\n- $m \\le A_i \\le M$ for each $0 \\le i < N$\n- the number returned\
  \ by Fulu's program, ran with the given parameter $K$, is different from the correct\
  \ median of the sequence $A$\nCan you help Lima find the lexicographically smallest\
  \ counterexample or determine that Fulu's program works perfectly for the given\
  \ parameters?\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single\
  \ integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases\
  \ follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated\
  \ integers $N$, $S$, $K$, $m$ and $M$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case,\
  \ if there is no proper sequence, print a single line containing the integer $-1$;\
  \ otherwise, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers — the lexicographically\
  \ smallest proper sequence.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 8$\n- $3\
  \ \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le K \\le N-1$\n- $1 \\le S \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le m\
  \ \\le M \\le S$\n\n-----Example Input-----\n2\n3 6 1 1 5\n4 4 2 1 3\n\n-----Example\
  \ Output-----\n1 1 4\n-1\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: For the sequence\
  \ $A = [1, 1, 4]$, it is already sorted, so the program would just remove the first\
  \ two elements ($K=1$, $N\\%K=0$) and return the only remaining element $4$. Obviously,\
  \ the median of the original sequence is $1$. It can be shown that there is no lexicographically\
  \ smaller proper sequence.\nExample case 2: The only possible sequence is $A = [1,\
  \ 1, 1, 1]$, which is not proper, since Fulu's program will give the correct answer\
  \ $1$ for it."
