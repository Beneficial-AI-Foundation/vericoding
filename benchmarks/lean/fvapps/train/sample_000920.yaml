"vc-description": "Chang's new maths teacher is very enthusiastic about making sure\
  \ that students understand the concept rather than remembering it. On her first\
  \ day at teaching, she gives an assignment to all the students to test their potential.\
  \ Chang wants to demonstrate that he understands the concept rather than rote learning.\
  \ Help Chang in doing this by solving the hardest problem in the assignment. The\
  \ problem is written as follows. \n\nA perfect function is defined in the following\
  \ manner.\n\n- F(x, y) = x2 + y for 1 ≤ x ≤ A, 1 ≤ y ≤ B\n- F(x, y) = 2 otherwise\n\
  \nFind the number of integral pairs (x, y) such that F(x, y) is a perfect square.\n\
  \n-----Input-----\nFirst and the only line of the input contains two single space\
  \ separated integers A and B.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a single integer indicating\
  \ the output to the only test case.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 106\n\
  \n-----Example-----\nInput:\n4 4\n\nOutput:\n1\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample\
  \ case 1.\n(1, 3) is the only pair such that x = 1, y = 3 satisfying x <= 4 and\
  \ y <= 4. 1^2 + 3 = 4 which is a perfect square."
