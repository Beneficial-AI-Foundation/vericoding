"vc-description": "_Yet another easy kata!_\n\n\n# Task:\n  \n  \n  - Let's write\
  \ a sequence starting with `seq = [0, 1, 2, 2]` in which\n      - 0 and 1 occurs\
  \ 1 time\n      - 2 occurs 2 time\n  \n  \n  and sequence advances with adding next\
  \ natural number `seq[natural number]` times so now, 3 appears \n  2 times and so\
  \ on.\n  \n  ### Input\n   - You are given input `n`  and return nth(0-based) value\
  \ of this list.\n  \n  \n  let;s take example:\n  \n  seq = [0, 1, 2, 2]\\\n  i\
