  \ Diagonal** -- the secondary diagonal of a matrix identifies those elements of\
  \ the matrix running from North-East to South-West.\n\nFor example:\n```\nmatrix:\
  \             [1, 2, 3]\n                    [4, 5, 6]\n                    [7,\
  \ 8, 9]\n\nprincipal diagonal: [1, 5, 9]\nsecondary diagonal: [3, 5, 7]\n\n```\n\
  \n## Task\nYour task is to find which diagonal is \"larger\": which diagonal has\
  \ a bigger sum of their elements.\n\n* If the principal diagonal is larger, return\
  \ `\"Principal Diagonal win!\"`\n* If the secondary diagonal is larger, return `\"\
  Secondary Diagonal win!\"`\n* If they are equal, return `\"Draw!\"`\n\n**Note:**\
  \ You will always receive matrices of the same dimension."
