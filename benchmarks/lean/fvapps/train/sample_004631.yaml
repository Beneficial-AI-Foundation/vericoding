"vc-description": "A sequence is usually a set or an array of numbers that has a strict\
  \ way for moving from the nth term to the (n+1)th term.\nIf ``f(n) = f(n-1) + c``\
  \ where ``c`` is a constant value, then ``f`` is an arithmetic sequence.\nAn example\
  \ would be (where the first term is 0 and the constant is 1) is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4,\
  \ 5, ... and so on] )\nElse if (pun) ``f(n) = f(n-1) * c`` where ``c`` is a constant\
  \ value, then ``f`` is a geometric sequence.\nExample where the first term is 2\
  \ and  the constant is 2 will be [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ... to infinity ... ]\nThere\
  \ are some sequences that aren't arithmetic nor are they geometric.\nHere is a link\
  \ to feed your brain : Sequence !\n\n\nYou're going to write a function that's going\
  \ to return the value in the nth index of an arithmetic sequence.(That is, adding\
  \ a constant to move to the next element in the \"set\").\n\nThe function's name\
  \ is `nthterm`/`Nthterm`, it takes three inputs `first`,`n`,`c` where:\n\n  - ``first``\
  \ is the first value in the 0 INDEX.\n  - ``n`` is the index of the value we want.\n\
  \  - ``c`` is the constant added between the terms.\n\nRemember that `first` is\
  \ in the index ``0`` .. just saying ..."
