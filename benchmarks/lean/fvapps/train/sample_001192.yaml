"vc-description": "There is a new prodigy in town and he has challenged people to\
  \ a game. They have to give him an integer N and he will immediately respond with\
  \ a number which has more than N factors.\nWhat the prodigy really does is to do\
  \ some complex calculations in his head to find out the smallest integer with more\
  \ than N factors. However, he has a weakness - he knows to do those calculation\
  \ only on numbers up to 1019, so if the answer to be reported is more than 1019,\
  \ he will not be able to come up with his solution and will lose the game.\nGiven\
  \ the integer the people give to the prodigy, you need to report whether he wins\
  \ the game or not. If he wins, also output his answer.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first\
  \ line of input contains T (T ≤ 25), the number of test cases. Following this are\
  \ T lines, each containing an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 109) - the number which is given\
  \ to the prodigy.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput one line per test case. If the smallest\
  \ integer X with more than N factors is bigger than 1019 so that the prodigy does\
  \ not win, print \"lose\". Otherwise print \"win X\" (quotes for clarity).\n\n-----Example-----\n\
  Input:\n3\n3\n5\n12345678\n\nOutput:\nwin 6\nwin 12\nlose"
