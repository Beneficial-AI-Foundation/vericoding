  \ 'I'm Alan Partridge episode:\n```\nLynn: Alan, there’s that teacher chap.\nAlan:\
  \ Michael, if he hits me, will you hit him first?\nMichael: No, he’s a customer.\
  \ I cannot hit customers. I’ve been told. I’ll go and get some stock.\nAlan: Yeah,\
  \ chicken stock.\nPhil: Hello Alan.\nAlan: Lynn, hand me an apple pie. And remove\
  \ yourself from the theatre of conflict.\nLynn: What do you mean?\nAlan: Go and\
  \ stand by the yakults. The temperature inside this apple turnover is 1,000 degrees.\
  \ If I squeeze it, a jet of molten Bramley apple is going to squirt out. Could go\
  \ your way, could go mine. Either way, one of us is going down.\n```\n\nAlan is\
  \ known for referring to the temperature of the apple turnover as 'Hotter than the\
  \ sun!'. According to  space.com the temperature of the sun's corona is 2,000,000\
  \ degrees C, but we will ignore the science for now. \n\nYour job is simple, if\
  \ (x) squared is more than 1000, return  'It's hotter than the sun!!', else, return\
  \ 'Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.'.\n\nX will be either a\
  \ number or a string. Both are valid. \n\nOther katas in this series:\nAlan Partridge\
