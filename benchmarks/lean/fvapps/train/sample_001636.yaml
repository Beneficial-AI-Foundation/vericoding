"vc-description": "Professor Chambouliard hast just discovered a new type of magnet\
  \ material. He put particles of this material in a box made of small boxes arranged\
  \ \nin K rows and N columns as a kind of **2D matrix** `K x N` where `K` and `N`\
  \ are postive integers.\nHe thinks that his calculations show that the force exerted\
  \ by the particle in the small box `(k, n)` is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total force exerted\
  \ by the first row with `k = 1` is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can go on with `k = 2` and then\
  \ `k = 3` etc ... and consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Task: \nTo help Professor Chambouliard\
  \ can we calculate the function `doubles` that will take as parameter `maxk` and\
  \ `maxn` such that `doubles(maxk, maxn) = S(maxk, maxn)`?\nExperiences seems to\
  \ show that this could be something around `0.7` when `maxk` and `maxn` are big\
  \ enough.\n\n### Examples:\n```\ndoubles(1, 3)  => 0.4236111111111111\ndoubles(1,\
  \ 10) => 0.5580321939764581\ndoubles(10, 100) => 0.6832948559787737\n```\n\n###\
  \ Notes: \n- In `u(1, N)` the dot is the *multiplication operator*.\n- Don't truncate\
  \ or round: \nHave a look in \"RUN EXAMPLES\" at \"assertFuzzyEquals\".\n\n- [link\
