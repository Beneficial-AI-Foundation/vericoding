"vc-description": "In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest\
  \ to lowest to all teams participated in the competition.\nThe ordering of teams\
  \ is decided by who received the most position-one votes. If two or more teams tie\
  \ in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict,\
  \ if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are resolved. If two\
  \ or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we rank them alphabetically\
  \ based on their team letter.\nGiven an array of strings votes which is the votes\
  \ of all voters in the ranking systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking\
  \ system described above.\nReturn a string of all teams sorted by the ranking system.\n\
   \nExample 1:\nInput: votes = [\"ABC\",\"ACB\",\"ABC\",\"ACB\",\"ACB\"]\nOutput:\
  \ \"ACB\"\nExplanation: Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team\
  \ was voted as first place so team A is the first team.\nTeam B was ranked second\
  \ by 2 voters and was ranked third by 3 voters.\nTeam C was ranked second by 3 voters\
  \ and was ranked third by 2 voters.\nAs most of the voters ranked C second, team\
  \ C is the second team and team B is the third.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: votes = [\"\
  WXYZ\",\"XYZW\"]\nOutput: \"XWYZ\"\nExplanation: X is the winner due to tie-breaking\
  \ rule. X has same votes as W for the first position but X has one vote as second\
  \ position while W doesn't have any votes as second position. \n\nExample 3:\nInput:\
  \ votes = [\"ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK\"]\nOutput: \"ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK\"\
  \nExplanation: Only one voter so his votes are used for the ranking.\n\nExample\
  \ 4:\nInput: votes = [\"BCA\",\"CAB\",\"CBA\",\"ABC\",\"ACB\",\"BAC\"]\nOutput:\
  \ \"ABC\"\nExplanation: \nTeam A was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters\
  \ and third by 2 voters.\nTeam B was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters\
  \ and third by 2 voters.\nTeam C was ranked first by 2 voters, second by 2 voters\
  \ and third by 2 voters.\nThere is a tie and we rank teams ascending by their IDs.\n\
  \nExample 5:\nInput: votes = [\"M\",\"M\",\"M\",\"M\"]\nOutput: \"M\"\nExplanation:\
  \ Only team M in the competition so it has the first rank.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\
  1 <= votes.length <= 1000\n1 <= votes[i].length <= 26\nvotes[i].length == votes[j].length\
  \ for 0 <= i, j < votes.length.\nvotes[i][j] is an English upper-case letter.\n\
  All characters of votes[i] are unique.\nAll the characters that occur in votes[0]\
  \ also occur in votes[j] where 1 <= j < votes.length."
