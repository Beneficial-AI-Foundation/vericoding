"vc-description": "A famous casino is suddenly faced with a sharp decline of their\
  \ revenues. They decide to offer Texas hold'em also online. Can you help them by\
  \ writing an algorithm that can rank poker hands? \n\n## Task\n\nCreate a poker\
  \ hand that has a method to compare itself to another poker hand:\n\n```python\n\
  compare_with(self, other_hand)\n```\n\nA poker hand has a constructor that accepts\
  \ a string containing 5 cards:\n```python\nPokerHand(\"KS 2H 5C JD TD\")\n```\n\n\
  The characteristics of the string of cards are:\n* Each card consists of two characters,\
  \ where\n * The first character is the value of the card: `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\
  \ 9, T(en), J(ack), Q(ueen), K(ing), A(ce)`\n * The second character represents\
  \ the suit: `S(pades), H(earts), D(iamonds), C(lubs)`\n* A space is used as card\
  \ separator between cards\n\nThe result of your poker hand compare can be one of\
  \ these 3 options:\n\n```python\n[ \"Win\", \"Tie\", \"Loss\" ]\n```\n\n## Notes\n\
  * Apply the [Texas Hold'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) rules\
  \ for ranking the cards.\n* Low aces are **NOT** valid in this kata.\n* There is\
  \ no ranking for the suits.\n\nIf you finished this kata, you might want to continue\
  \ with [Sortable Poker Hands](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sortable-poker-hands)"
