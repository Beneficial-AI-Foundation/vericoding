"vc-description": "Vasya's telephone contains n photos. Photo number 1 is currently\
  \ opened on the phone. It is allowed to move left and right to the adjacent photo\
  \ by swiping finger over the screen. If you swipe left from the first photo, you\
  \ reach photo n. Similarly, by swiping right from the last photo you reach photo\
  \ 1. It takes a seconds to swipe from photo to adjacent.\n\nFor each photo it is\
  \ known which orientation is intended for it — horizontal or vertical. Phone is\
  \ in the vertical orientation and can't be rotated. It takes b second to change\
  \ orientation of the photo.\n\nVasya has T seconds to watch photos. He want to watch\
  \ as many photos as possible. If Vasya opens the photo for the first time, he spends\
  \ 1 second to notice all details in it. If photo is in the wrong orientation, he\
  \ spends b seconds on rotating it before watching it. If Vasya has already opened\
  \ the photo, he just skips it (so he doesn't spend any time for watching it or for\
  \ changing its orientation). It is not allowed to skip unseen photos.\n\nHelp Vasya\
  \ find the maximum number of photos he is able to watch during T seconds.\n\n\n\
  -----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains 4 integers n, a, b, T (1\
  \ ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^9) — the number of photos, time to move\
  \ from a photo to adjacent, time to change orientation of a photo and time Vasya\
  \ can spend for watching photo.\n\nSecond line of the input contains a string of\
  \ length n containing symbols 'w' and 'h'. \n\nIf the i-th position of a string\
  \ contains 'w', then the photo i should be seen in the horizontal orientation.\n\
  \nIf the i-th position of a string contains 'h', then the photo i should be seen\
  \ in vertical orientation.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput the only integer, the\
  \ maximum number of photos Vasya is able to watch during those T seconds.\n\n\n\
  -----Examples-----\nInput\n4 2 3 10\nwwhw\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5 2 4 13\nhhwhh\n\
  \nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n5 2 4 1000\nhhwhh\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n3 1 100 10\nwhw\n\
  \nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test you can rotate the\
  \ first photo (3 seconds), watch the first photo (1 seconds), move left (2 second),\
  \ rotate fourth photo (3 seconds), watch fourth photo (1 second). The whole process\
  \ takes exactly 10 seconds.\n\nNote that in the last sample test the time is not\
  \ enough even to watch the first photo, also you can't skip it."
