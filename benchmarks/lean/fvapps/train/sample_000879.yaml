"vc-description": "The most dangerous cyborg Jenish is finally entrapped on a narrow\
  \ bridge over a valley. The bridge is $N$ meters long. For convenience, position\
  \ $i$ represents a portion of bridge between whose left border is at distance $i-1$\
  \ meters from left end and right border is at distance $i$ meters from left end.\
  \ \nThere are $N$ batteries placed at positions $1,2...N$. The $i^{th}$ one has\
  \ energy $a[i]$.\nThere are two tanks of strength $X$ at positions $0$ and $N+1$.\
  \ Initially Jenish has $0$ energy.\nFrom now at any second $t$ starting from $1$,\
  \ \nfirst, Jenish can select any battery placed at position $i$ such that $(t \\\
  leq i \\leq N-t+1)$ and add $a[i]$ to his energy (every battery can be used atmost\
  \ once).\nThen both the tanks move one meter towards each other. If there are still\
  \ any batteries present at positions where the tanks are heading, the battery gets\
  \ destroyed. \nAt any moment if Jenish's total energy is greater than or equal to\
  \ $X$, he destroys both the tanks and he escapes the cops. If by the end of $\\\
  lfloor \\frac {(n+1)}{2}\\rfloor^{th}$ second, he can't destroy the tanks, he himself\
  \ gets destroyed. Find out if he can escape.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line\
  \ consists of a single integer $T$, the number of test cases.\n- The first line\
  \ of each test case contains two space separated integers which represents $N$ and\
  \ $X$ for that test case respectively.\n- The second line of each test case contains\
  \ $N$ space separated integers, $i^{th}$ of which represents $a[i]$.\n\n-----Output:-----\n\
  For each test case, print in a single line, $YES$ if Jenish can escape or $NO$ if\
  \ he gets destroyed.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq  X \\leq 10^9$\n- $0\
  \ \\leq a[i] \\leq 10^6$\n- $ 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $\\Sigma$ $N$ over all the\
  \ test cases does not exceed $10^5$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n3\n4 8\n5 1 4 2\n\
  3 4\n3 1 2\n2 7\n5 5\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\n-----Explanation-----\n\
  For test $1$, in the 1st second, first Jenish will select battery at index $1$ and\
  \ then the tanks from either side will move one meter closer, thus destroying the\
  \ battery at index $4$.Then, in the next second, Jenish will select battery at index\
  \ $3$.Then,tanks will move one meter closer again to destroy the remaining battery\
  \ at index $2$.But now, Jenish has a total energy of $9$ units which is more than\
  \ enough to destroy the tanks.\nFor test $2$, Jenish can use batteries at index\
  \ $1$ and $2$ to get a total energy of $4$ units.\nFor test $3$, Jenish can use\
  \ batteries at index $1$ or $2$ and get a maximum of $5$ units of energy which is\
  \ less than required."
