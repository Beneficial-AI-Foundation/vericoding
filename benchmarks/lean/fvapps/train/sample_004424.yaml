"vc-description": "Calculus class...is awesome! But you are a programmer with no time\
  \ for mindless repetition. Your teacher spent a whole day covering differentiation\
  \ of polynomials, and by the time the bell rang, you had already conjured up a program\
  \ to automate the process.\n\nYou realize that a polynomial of degree n\n\nanx^(n)\
  \ + an-1x^(n-1) + ... + a0\n\ncan be represented as an array of coefficients\n\n\
  [an, an-1, ...,  a0]\n\nFor example, we would represent\n\n5x^(2) + 2x + 1 as [5,2,1]\n\
  \n3x^(2) + 1 as [3,0,1]\n\nx^(4) as [1,0,0,0,0]\n\nx as [1, 0]\n\n1 as [1]\n\nYour\
  \ function will take a coefficient array as an argument and return a **new array**\
  \ representing the coefficients of the derivative.\n\n```python\npoly1 = [1, 1]\
  \ # x + 1\ndiff(poly1) == [1] # 1\n\npoly2 = [1, 1, 1] # x^2 + x + 1\ndiff(poly2)\
  \ == [2, 1] # 2x + 1\ndiff(diff(poly2)) == [2] # 2\n\npoly3 = [2, 1, 0, 0] # 2x^3\
  \ + x^2\ndiff(poly3) == [6, 2, 0] # 6x^2 + 2x\n```\nNote: your function will always\
  \ return a new array which has one less element than the argument (unless the argument\
  \ is [], in which case [] is returned)."
