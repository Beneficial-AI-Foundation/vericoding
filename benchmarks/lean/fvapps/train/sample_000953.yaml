"vc-description": "Special Numbers \nMani has encountered a problem on Special numbers\
  \ in Bytecode. A number S is called a special number if its digits are in an arithmetic\
  \ progression modulo 10. He has an array consisting of all numbers from 1 to N and\
  \ needs your help to find the number of special numbers in the array. He has promised\
  \ you a significant share of the prize money if he wins the contest :p \nNote:\n\
  123,99,802 are special numbers.\n146 is not a special number \n\n-----Input-----\n\
  \nInput consists of 1 integer - the value of N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint one integer\
  \ in the first line - the solution to this problem\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1\
  \ ≤ Number of digits in N ≤ 105\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n123\n\nOutput\n\n102"
