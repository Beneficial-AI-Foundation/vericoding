"vc-description": "# Feynman's squares\nRichard Phillips Feynman was a well-known\
  \ American physicist and a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics. He worked in\
  \ theoretical physics and pioneered the field of quantum computing.\n\nRecently,\
  \ an old farmer found some papers and notes that are believed to have belonged to\
  \ Feynman. Among notes about mesons and electromagnetism, there was a napkin where\
  \ he wrote a simple puzzle: \"how many different squares are there in a grid of\
  \ NxN squares?\".\n\nFor example, when N=2, the answer is 5: the 2x2 square itself,\
  \ plus the four 1x1 squares in its corners:\n\n\n\n# Task\n\nYou have to write a\
  \ function\n\n```python\ndef count_squares(n):\n```\n\nthat solves Feynman's question\
  \ in general. The input to your function will always be a positive integer.\n\n\
  #Examples\n\n```python\ncount_squares(1) =  1\ncount_squares(2) =  5\ncount_squares(3)\
  \ = 14\n```\n\n(Adapted from the Sphere Online Judge problem SAMER08F by Diego Satoba)"
