"vc-description": "You are working at a lower league football stadium and you've been\
  \ tasked with automating the scoreboard.\n\nThe referee will shout out the score,\
  \ you have already set up the voice recognition module which turns the ref's voice\
  \ into a string, but the spoken score needs to be converted into a pair for the\
  \ scoreboard!\n\ne.g. `\"The score is four nil\"` should return `[4,0]`\n\nEither\
  \ teams score has a range of 0-9, and the ref won't say the same string every time\
  \ e.g. \n      \n    \"new score: two three\"\n      \n    \"two two\"\n      \n\
  \    \"Arsenal just conceded another goal, two nil\"\n    \nNote:\n```python\nPlease\
  \ return an array\n```\n\nPlease rate and enjoy!"
