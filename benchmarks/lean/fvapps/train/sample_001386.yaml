"vc-description": "A prime number is number x which has only divisors as 1 and x itself.\n\
  Harsh is playing a game with his friends, where his friends give him a few numbers\
  \ claiming that they are divisors of some number x but divisor 1 and the number\
  \ x itself are not being given as divisors.\nYou need to help harsh find which number's\
  \ divisors are given here.\nHis friends can also give him wrong set of divisors\
  \ as a trick question for which no number exists.\nSimply, We are given the divisors\
  \ of a number x ( divisors except 1 and x itself ) , you have to print the number\
  \ if only it is possible.\nYou have to answer t queries.\n(USE LONG LONG TO PREVENT\
  \ OVERFLOW)\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line is T queires.\n- Next are T queries.\n\
  - First line is N ( No of divisors except 1 and the number itself )\n- Next line\
  \ has N integers or basically the divisors.\n\n-----Output:-----\nPrint the minimum\
  \ possible x which has such divisors and print -1 if not possible.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n\
  - 1<= T <= 30\n- 1<= N <= 350\n- 2<= Di <=10^6\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n3\n2\n\
  2 3\n2\n4 2\n3\n12 3 2\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n6\n8\n-1\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\n\
  Query 1 : Divisors of 6 are ( 1,2,3,6) Therefore, Divisors except 1 and the number\
  \ 6 itself are ( 2 , 3). Thus, ans = 6.\nQuery 2 : Divisors of 8 are ( 1,2,4,8)\
  \ Therefore, Divisors except 1 and the number 8 itself are ( 2 , 4). Thus, ans =\
  \ 8.\nQuery 3 : There is no such number x with only ( 1,2,3,12,x ) as the divisors."
