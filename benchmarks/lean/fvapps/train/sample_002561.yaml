  \ He solves kata like a banshee but would also like to lead a normal life, with\
  \ other activities. But he just can't stop solving all the kata!!\n\nGiven an array\
  \ (x) you need to calculate the Paul Misery Score. The values are worth the following\
  \ points:\n\nkata = 5\nPetes kata = 10\nlife = 0\neating = 1\n\nThe Misery Score\
  \ is the total points gained from the array. Once you have the total, return as\
  \ follows:\n\n<40        = 'Super happy!'<70   >=40 = 'Happy!'<100  >=70 = 'Sad!'\\\
  >=100       = 'Miserable!'"
