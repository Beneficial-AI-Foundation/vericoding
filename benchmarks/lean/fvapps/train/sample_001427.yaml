"vc-description": "You are participating in a contest which has $11$ problems (numbered\
  \ $1$ through $11$). The first eight problems (i.e. problems $1, 2, \\ldots, 8$)\
  \ are scorable, while the last three problems ($9$, $10$ and $11$) are non-scorable\
  \ ― this means that any submissions you make on any of these problems do not affect\
  \ your total score.\nYour total score is the sum of your best scores for all scorable\
  \ problems. That is, for each scorable problem, you look at the scores of all submissions\
  \ you made on that problem and take the maximum of these scores (or $0$ if you didn't\
  \ make any submissions on that problem); the total score is the sum of the maximum\
  \ scores you took.\nYou know the results of all submissions you made. Calculate\
  \ your total score.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a\
  \ single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test\
  \ cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$\
  \ denoting the number of submissions you made.\n- $N$ lines follow. For each $i$\
  \ ($1 \\le i \\le N$), the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers\
  \ $p_i$ and $s_i$, denoting that your $i$-th submission was on problem $p_i$ and\
  \ it received a score $s_i$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single\
  \ line containing one integer ― your total score.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1\
  \ \\le T \\le 10$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 1,000$\n- $1 \\le p_i \\le 11$ for each valid\
  \ $i$\n- $0 \\le s_i \\le 100$ for each valid $i$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask\
  \ #1 (15 points): all submissions are on the same problem, i.e. $p_1 = p_2 = \\\
  ldots = p_N$\nSubtask #2 (15 points): there is at most one submission made on each\
  \ problem, i.e. $p_i \\neq p_j$ for each valid $i, j$ ($i \\neq j$)\nSubtask #3\
  \ (70 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n2\n5\n2 45\n9 100\n\

  Example case 1: The scorable problems with at least one submission are problems\
  \ $2$ and $8$. For problem $2$, there are two submissions and the maximum score\
  \ among them is $45$. For problem $8$, there are also two submissions and the maximum\
  \ score is $90$. Hence, the total score is $45 + 90 = 135$.\nExample case 2: No\
  \ scorable problem is attempted, so the total score is $0$."
