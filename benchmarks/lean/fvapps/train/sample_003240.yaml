"vc-description": "# Introduction\n\n\nFish are an integral part of any ecosystem.\
  \ Unfortunately, fish are often seen as high maintenance. Contrary to popular belief,\
  \ fish actually reduce pond maintenance as they graze on string algae and bottom\
  \ feed from the pond floor. They also make very enjoyable pets, providing hours\
  \ of natural entertainment.\n\n\n\n# Task\n\n\nIn this Kata you are fish in a pond\
  \ that needs to survive by eating other fish. You can only eat fish that are the\
  \ same size or smaller than yourself. \nYou must create a function called fish that\
  \ takes a shoal of fish as an input string. From this you must work out how many\
  \ fish you can eat and ultimately the size you will grow to.\n\n\n# Rules\n\n1. \
  \ Your size starts at 1\n\n2.  The shoal string will contain fish integers between\
  \ 0-9\n\n3.  0 = algae and wont help you feed.\n\n4.  The fish integer represents\
  \ the size of the fish (1-9).\n\n5.  You can only eat fish the same size or less\
  \ than yourself.\n\n6.  You can eat the fish in any order you choose to maximize\
  \ your size.\n\n7   You can and only eat each fish once.\n\n8.  The bigger fish\
  \ you eat, the faster you grow. A size 2 fish equals two size 1 fish, size 3 fish\
  \ equals three size 1 fish, and so on.\n\n9.  Your size increments by one each time\
  \ you reach the amounts below.\n\n\n# Increase your size\nYour size will increase\
  \ depending how many fish you eat and on the size of the fish.\nThis chart shows\
  \ the amount of size 1 fish you have to eat in order to increase your size.\n\n\n\
  \n\nCurrent size\nAmount extra needed for next size\nTotal size 1 fish\nIncrease\
  \ to size\n\n\n1\n4\n4\n2\n\n\n2\n8\n12\n3\n\n\n3\n12\n24\n4\n\n\n4\n16\n40\n5\n\
  \n\n5\n20\n60\n6\n\n\n6\n24\n84\n7\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease note: The chart represents\
  \ fish of size 1\n\n# Returns\n\nReturn an integer of the maximum size you could\
  \ be.\n\n\n# Example 1\nYou eat the 4 fish of size 1 (4 * 1 = 4) which increases\
  \ your size to 2\nNow that you are size 2 you can eat the fish that are sized 1\
  \ or 2.\nYou then eat the 4 fish of size 2 (4 * 2 = 8) which increases your size\
  \ to 3\n\n\n\n```python\nfish(\"11112222\") => 3\n```\n\n# Example 2\n\nYou eat\
  \ the 4 fish of size 1 (4 * 1 = 4) which increases your size to 2\nYou then eat\
  \ the remainding 8 fish of size 1 (8 * 1 = 8) which increases your size to 3\n\n\
  ```python\nfish(\"111111111111\") => 3\n```\n\nGood luck and enjoy!\n\n# Kata Series\n\
