"vc-description": "Nobody outside the cooking community knows that Chef is a big fan\
  \ of Chefgram™ — a social network where chefs and cooks upload their secret kitchen\
  \ photos.\nRecently Chef clicked a beautiful photo, which is represented using 10\
  \ pixels in a single row. Respecting Chefgram™'s boolean roots, every pixel is either\
  \ white or black.\n\nChefgram™ has N filters. Every filter is a string containing\
  \ 10 symbols. Every symbol is either '+' or '-'.\n\n- A '+' at the ith position\
  \ in a filter means that if Chef applies this filter to his photo, the ith pixel\
  \ will be inverted: it becomes black if it was originally white, and vice versa.\
  \ \n- A '-' at the ith position in a filter string means that if Chef applies this\
  \ filter to his photo, the ith pixel will remain unchanged.\n\nChef can apply as\
  \ many filters as he wants from a list. He can pick any subset of filters and consequently\
  \ apply them to a photo.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Imagine that Chef has a photo \"bbwwbbwwbb\"\
  \ (where 'b' stands for black and 'w' stands for white).\n- He applies filters \"\
  ++--++--++\", \"-+-+-+-+-+\".\n- Applying the first filter will transform his picture\
  \ to \"wwwwwwwwww\". \n- Applying the second filter on the transformed picture will\
  \ give Chef the picture \"wbwbwbwbwb\".\n\nEven if Chefgram™ has two or more identical\
  \ filters, they are still considered different!\n\nChef is extremely interested\
  \ in knowing how many different subsets of all the Chefgram™ filters can he apply\
  \ to transform his photo into 10 black pixels?\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line\
  \ of input contains a single integer T — the number of test cases.\n- First line\
  \ of each test case contains a string S. Each symbol is either 'b' or 'w'. This\
  \ is Chef's photo.\n- Second line of each test case contains a single integer N\
  \ — the number of Chefgram™ filters.\n- Each of the next N lines contains a single\
  \ string Fi, each symbol of which is either '+' or '-'. This string is the ith Chefgram™\
  \ filter.\n\n-----Output-----\n- For each test case, output a single line containing\
  \ a single integer — answer to Chef's question modulo 109+7.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n\
  - 1 ≤ T ≤ 5\n- |S| = 10\n- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5\n- |Fi| = 10\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask\
  \ 1: T ≤ 5; N ≤ 20; Points: 20\n- Subtask 2: T ≤ 5; N ≤ 10^3; Points: 30\n- Subtask\
  \ 3: T ≤ 5; N ≤ 10^5; Points: 50\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n3\nwwwwwwwwww\n3\n\

  Example case 1. There is no filter or combination of filters transforming the picture\
  \ to whole black. \nExample case 2. Chef can either apply the first filter (and\
  \ invert all whites) or apply the second and third filters in any order.\nExample\
  \ case 3. Picture is already fully black, and we have two different identity filters.\
  \ Chef can either apply the empty subset of filters, the first filter only, the\
  \ second filter only, or both."
