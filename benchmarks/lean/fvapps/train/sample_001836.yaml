"vc-description": "Given a chemical formula (given as a string), return the count\
  \ of each atom.\n\nAn atomic element always starts with an uppercase character,\
  \ then zero or more lowercase letters, representing the name.\n\n1 or more digits\
  \ representing the count of that element may follow if the count is greater than\
  \ 1.  If the count is 1, no digits will follow.  For example, H2O and H2O2 are possible,\
  \ but H1O2 is impossible.\n\nTwo formulas concatenated together produce another\
  \ formula.  For example, H2O2He3Mg4 is also a formula.  \n\nA formula placed in\
  \ parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a formula.  For example, (H2O2)\
  \ and (H2O2)3 are formulas.\n\nGiven a formula, output the count of all elements\
  \ as a string in the following form: the first name (in sorted order), followed\
  \ by its count (if that count is more than 1), followed by the second name (in sorted\
  \ order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), and so on.\n\nExample\
  \ 1:\n\nInput: \nformula = \"H2O\"\nOutput: \"H2O\"\nExplanation: \nThe count of\
  \ elements are {'H': 2, 'O': 1}.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: \nformula = \"Mg(OH)2\"\
  \nOutput: \"H2MgO2\"\nExplanation: \nThe count of elements are {'H': 2, 'Mg': 1,\
  \ 'O': 2}.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: \nformula = \"K4(ON(SO3)2)2\"\nOutput: \"\
  K4N2O14S4\"\nExplanation: \nThe count of elements are {'K': 4, 'N': 2, 'O': 14,\
  \ 'S': 4}.\n\n\n\nNote:\nAll atom names consist of lowercase letters, except for\
  \ the first character which is uppercase.\nThe length of formula will be in the\
  \ range [1, 1000].\nformula will only consist of letters, digits, and round parentheses,\
  \ and is a valid formula as defined in the problem."
