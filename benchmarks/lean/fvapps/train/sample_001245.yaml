"vc-description": "So the Chef has become health conscious and is now lifting weights\
  \ at the gym. But its his first time so the trainer gives him a simple job to do.\
  \ \n\nHe has been given a weight lifting rod and N heavy weights, each weighing\
  \ 20, 21, .... , 2n-1. He has to stick each of the \"N\" weights on the rod, one\
  \ after another, in such a way that the right side is never heavier than the left\
  \ side. At each step he chooses one of the weights that has not yet been fixed on\
  \ the rod, and fix it on either the left side of the rod or the right, until all\
  \ of the weights have been placed.\n\nNow help the chef and find out, in how many\
  \ ways the chef can accomplish this?\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line of input contains\
  \ an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each line of\
  \ test case contains one integer, N denoting the number of weights\n\n-----Output-----\n\
  The output contains T lines, each containing an integer denoting all possible combinations\n\
