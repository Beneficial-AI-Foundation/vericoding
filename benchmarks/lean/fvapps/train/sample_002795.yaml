"vc-description": "A high school has a strange principal. On the first day, he has\
  \ his students perform an odd opening day ceremony:\n\nThere are number of lockers\
  \ \"n\" and number of students \"n\" in the school. The principal asks the first\
  \ student to go to every locker and open it. Then he has the second student go to\
  \ every second locker and close it. The third goes to every third locker and, if\
  \ it is closed, he opens it, and if it is open, he closes it. The fourth student\
  \ does this to every fourth locker, and so on. After the process is completed with\
  \ the \"n\"th student, how many lockers are open?\n\nThe task is to write a function\
  \ which gets any number as an input and returns the number of open lockers after\
  \ last sudent complets his activity. So input of the function is just one number\
  \ which shows number of lockers and number of students. For example if there are\
  \ 1000 lockers and 1000 students in school then input is 1000 and function returns\
  \ number of open lockers after 1000th student completes his action.\n\nThe given\
  \ input is always an integer greater than or equal to zero that is why there is\
  \ no need for validation."
