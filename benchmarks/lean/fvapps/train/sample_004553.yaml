"vc-description": "Among the ruins of an ancient city a group of archaeologists found\
  \ a mysterious function with lots of HOLES in it called ```getNum(n)``` (or `get_num(n)`\
  \ in ruby, python, or r). They tried to call it with some arguments. And finally\
  \ they got this journal:\nThe archaeologists were totally stuck with this challenge.\
  \ They were all in desperation but then.... came YOU the SUPER-AWESOME programmer.\
  \ Will you be able to understand the mystery of this function and rewrite it?"
