"vc-description": "Description\n\nLets imagine a yoga classroom as a Square 2D Array\
  \ of Integers ```classroom```, with each integer representing a person, and the\
  \ value representing their skill level.\n\n```\nclassroom = [\n            [3,2,1,3],\n\
  \            [1,3,2,1],\n            [1,1,1,2],\n            ]\n            \nposes\
  \ = [1,7,5,9,10,21,4,3]\n```\n\nDuring a yoga class the instructor gives a list\
  \ of integers ```poses``` representing a yoga pose that each person in the class\
  \ will attempt to complete.\n\nA person can complete a yoga pose if the sum of their\
  \ row and their skill level is greater than or equal to the value of the pose.\n\
  \n Task\n\nYour task is to return the total amount poses completed for the entire\
  \ ```classroom```.\n\nExample\n\n```\nclassroom = [\n            [1,1,0,1], #sum\
  \ = 3\n            [2,0,6,0], #sum = 8\n            [0,2,2,0], #sum = 4\n      \
  \      ]\n                    \nposes = [4, 0, 20, 10]\n\n3 people in row 1 can\
  \ complete the first pose\nEverybody in row 1 can complete the second pose\nNobody\
  \ in row 1 can complete the third pose\nNobody in row 1 can complete the fourth\
  \ pose\n\nThe total poses completed for row 1 is 7\n\nYou'll need to return the\
  \ total for all rows and all poses.\n```\n\nTranslations are welcomed!"
