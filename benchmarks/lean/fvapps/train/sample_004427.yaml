"vc-description": "You probably know the 42 number as \"The answer to life, the universe\
  \ and everything\" according to Douglas Adams' \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"\
  . For Freud, the answer was quite different.\n\nIn the society he lived in, people-women\
  \ in particular- had to repress their sexual needs and desires. This was simply\
  \ how the society was at the time. \nFreud then wanted to study the illnesses created\
  \ by this, and so he digged to the root of their desires. This led to some of the\
  \ most important psychoanalytic theories to this day, Freud being the father of\
  \ psychoanalysis.\n\nNow, basically, when a person hears about Freud, s/he hears\
  \ \"sex\" because for Freud, everything was basically related to, and explained\
  \ by sex. \n\nIn this kata, the toFreud() function will take a string as its argument,\
  \ and return a string with every word replaced by the explanation to everything,\
  \ according to Freud. Note that an empty string, or no arguments, should result\
  \ in the ouput being \"\"(empty string)."
