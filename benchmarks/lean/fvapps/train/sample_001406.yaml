vc-description: |-
  The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

  -----Input-----
  The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k<=107). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer ti, not greater than 109, each.

  -----Output-----
  Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers ti are divisible by k.

  -----Example-----
  Input:
  7 3
  1
  51
  966369
  7
  9
  999996
  11

  Output:
  4
