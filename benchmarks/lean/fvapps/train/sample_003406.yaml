"vc-description": "In the morning all the doors in the school are closed. The school\
  \ is quite big: there are **N** doors. Then pupils start coming. It might be hard\
  \ to believe, but all of them want to study! Also, there are exactly **N** children\
  \ studying in this school, and they come one by one.\n\nWhen these strange children\
  \ pass by some doors they change their status (i.e. Open -> Closed, Closed -> Open).\
  \ Each student has their number, and each i-th student alters the status of every\
  \ i-th door. For example: when the first child comes to the schools, he changes\
  \ every first door (he opens all of them). The second one changes the status of\
  \ every second door (he closes some doors: the 2nd, the 4th and so on). Finally,\
  \ when the last one – the n-th – comes to the school, he changes the status of each\
  \ n-th door (there's only one such door, though).\n\nYou need to count how many\
  \ doors are left opened after all the students have come.\n\nExample:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/IqlOi2q.png)\n\
  \n*Here you can see red squares – closed doors, green – opened ones.*\n\nInput:\n\
