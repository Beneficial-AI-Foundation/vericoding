"vc-description": "It is 2050 and romance has long gone, relationships exist solely\
  \ for practicality.\n\nMatchMyHusband is a website that matches busy working women\
  \ with perfect house husbands. You have been employed by MatchMyHusband to write\
  \ a function that determines who matches!!\n\nThe rules are... a match occurs providing\
  \ the husband's \"usefulness\" rating is greater than or equal to the woman's \"\
  needs\".\n\nThe husband's \"usefulness\" is the SUM of his cooking, cleaning and\
  \ childcare abilities and takes the form of an array .\n\nusefulness example -->\
  \ [15, 26, 19]    (15 + 26 + 19) = 60\n\nEvery woman that signs up, begins with\
  \ a \"needs\" rating of 100. However, it's realised that the longer women wait for\
  \ their husbands, the more dissatisfied they become with our service. They also\
  \ become less picky, therefore their needs are subject to exponential decay of 15%\
  \ per month. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay\n\nGiven the number\
  \ of months since sign up, write a function that returns \"Match!\" if the husband\
  \ is useful enough, or \"No match!\" if he's not."
