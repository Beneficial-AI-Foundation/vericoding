"vc-description": "Sheldon is a little geek living in Texas. While his friends like\
  \ to play outside, little Sheldon likes to play around with ICs and lasers in his\
  \ house. He decides to build N clap activated toggle machines each with one power\
  \ inlet and one outlet. Each machine works when its power source inlet is receiving\
  \ power. When the machine is in 'ON' state and is receiving power at its inlet,\
  \ it makes power available at its power outlet to which a bulb or another ToGgLe\
  \ machine could be attached.\n\nSuppose Sheldon attached 2 such machines to one\
  \ another with the power inlet of the first machine attached to a power source at\
  \ his house and the outlet of the second machine to a bulb. Initially both machines\
  \ are in 'OFF' state and power source to first machine is off too. Now the power\
  \ source is switched on. The first machine receives power but being in the 'OFF'\
  \ state it does not transmit any power. Now on clapping the first ToGgLe machine\
  \ toggles to 'ON' and the second machine receives power. On clapping once more the\
  \ first toggles to 'OFF' and the second toggles to 'ON'. But since the second ToGgLe\
  \ machine receives no power the bulb does not light up yet. On clapping once more,\
  \ the first machine which is still receiving power from the source toggles to 'ON'\
  \ and the second which was already 'ON' does not toggle since it was not receiving\
  \ power. So both the machine are in 'ON' state and the bulb lights up and little\
  \ Sheldon is happy.\n\nBut when Sheldon goes out for a while, his evil twin sister\
  \ attaches N such ToGgLe machines (after making sure they were all in 'OFF' state)\
  \ and attaches the first to a power source (the power source is initially switched\
  \ off) and the last ToGgLe machine to a bulb. Sheldon is horrified to find that\
  \ his careful arrangement has been disturbed.\n\nCoders, help the poor boy by finding\
  \ out if clapping k times for the N ToGgLe machines (all in 'OFF' state with the\
  \ first one connected to a switched off power source and last one to a bulb) would\
  \ light the bulb. Hurry before Sheldon has a nervous breakdown!\n\n-----Input-----\n\
  First line has number of test cases, T.\n\nFollowing T lines have N, k separated\
  \ by a single space where N is the number of \nToGgLe machines and k is the number\
  \ of times Sheldon clapped.\n\n-----Output-----\nT lines with cach line of the form:\
  \ \"ON\" (just the word on without the double quotes) if the bulb is 'ON' for the\
  \ \ntest case numbered n and \"OFF\" (just the word off without the double quotes)\
  \ if the bulb is 'OFF' for the test case numbered n.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n\
