"vc-description": "In Dark Souls, players level up trading souls for stats. 8 stats\
  \ are upgradable this way: vitality, attunement, endurance, strength, dexterity,\
  \ resistance, intelligence, and faith. Each level corresponds to adding one point\
  \ to a stat of the player's choice. Also, there are 10 possible classes each having\
  \ their own starting level and stats:\n\n```\nWarrior     (Level 4):  11, 8, 12,\
  \ 13, 13, 11, 9, 9\nKnight      (Level 5):  14, 10, 10, 11, 11, 10, 9, 11\nWanderer\
  \    (Level 3):  10, 11, 10, 10, 14, 12, 11, 8\nThief       (Level 5):  9, 11, 9,\
  \ 9, 15, 10, 12, 11\nBandit      (Level 4):  12, 8, 14, 14, 9, 11, 8, 10\nHunter\
  \      (Level 4):  11, 9, 11, 12, 14, 11, 9, 9\nSorcerer    (Level 3):  8, 15, 8,\
  \ 9, 11, 8, 15, 8\nPyromancer  (Level 1):  10, 12, 11, 12, 9, 12, 10, 8\nCleric\
  \      (Level 2):  11, 11, 9, 12, 8, 11, 8, 14\nDeprived    (Level 6):  11, 11,\
  \ 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11\n```\n\nFrom level 1, the necessary souls to level up each\
  \ time up to 11 are `673`, `690`, `707`, `724`, `741`, `758`, `775`, `793`, `811`,\
  \ and `829`. Then from 11 to 12 and onwards the amount is defined by the expression\
  \ `round(pow(x, 3) * 0.02 + pow(x, 2) * 3.06 + 105.6 * x - 895)` where `x` is the\
  \ number corresponding to the next level.\n\nYour function will receive a string\
  \ with the character class and a list of stats. It should calculate which level\
  \ is required to get the desired character build and the amount of souls needed\
  \ to do so. The result should be a string in the format: `'Starting as a [CLASS],\
  \ level [N] will require [M] souls.'` where `[CLASS]` is your starting class, `[N]`\
  \ is the required level, and `[M]` is the amount of souls needed respectively."
