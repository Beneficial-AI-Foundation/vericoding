"vc-description": "# Task\nA newspaper is published in Walrusland. Its heading is\
  \ `s1` , it consists of lowercase Latin letters. \n\nFangy the little walrus wants\
  \ to buy several such newspapers, cut out their headings, glue them one to another\
  \ in order to get one big string. \n\nAfter that walrus erase several letters from\
  \ this string in order to get a new word `s2`. \n\nIt is considered that when Fangy\
  \ erases some letter, there's no whitespace formed instead of the letter. That is,\
  \ the string remains unbroken and it still only consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\
  \nFor example, the heading is `\"abc\"`. If we take two such headings and glue them\
  \ one to the other one, we get `\"abcabc\"`. If we erase the 1st letter(\"a\") and\
  \ 5th letter(\"b\"), we get a word `\"bcac\"`.\n\nGiven two string `s1` and `s2`,\
  \ return the least number of newspaper headings `s1`, which Fangy will need to receive\
  \ the word `s2`. If it is impossible to get the word `s2` in the above-described\
  \ manner, return `-1`.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `s1=\"abc\", s2=\"bcac\"`, the output\
  \ should be `2`.\n\n```\n\"abcabc\" --> \"bcac\"\n x   x\n```\n\nFor `s1=\"abc\"\
  , s2=\"xyz\"`, the output should be `-1`.\n\nIt's impossible to get the word `s2`."
