"vc-description": "In africa jungle , there were zebra's who liked to spit.\nThere\
  \ owner watched them for whole day and noted in his sheet where each zebra spitted.\n\
  Now he's in a confusion and wants to know if in the jungle there are two zebra's\
  \ which spitted at each other.\nHelp him solve this task.\nIf the zebra is present\
  \ in position a spits b metres right , he can hit only zebra in position a+b , if\
  \ such a zebra exists.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line contains integer t(1<=t<100)-\
  \ amount of zebras in jungle.\n- Each of following t lines contains two integers\
  \ a(i) and b(i)(-10^4<=x(i)<=10^4,1<|d(i)|<=2.10^4) - records in owner sheet.\n\
  - a(i) is the position of i-th zebra and b(i) is distance at which the i-th camel\
  \ spitted.\nPositive values of d(i) correspond to spits right, negative values correspond\
  \ to spit left.No two zebras may stand in the same position.\n\n-----Output:-----\n\
  If there are two zebras , which spitted at each other , output YES, otherwise ,\
  \ output NO.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n0 1\n1 -1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n\
  YES"
