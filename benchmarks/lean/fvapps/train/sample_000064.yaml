"vc-description": "You and your friend are playing the game Mortal Kombat XI. You\
  \ are trying to pass a challenge tower. There are $n$ bosses in this tower, numbered\
  \ from $1$ to $n$. The type of the $i$-th boss is $a_i$. If the $i$-th boss is easy\
  \ then its type is $a_i = 0$, otherwise this boss is hard and its type is $a_i =\
  \ 1$.\n\nDuring one session, either you or your friend can kill one or two bosses\
  \ (neither you nor your friend can skip the session, so the minimum number of bosses\
  \ killed during one session is at least one). After your friend session, your session\
  \ begins, then again your friend session begins, your session begins, and so on.\
  \ The first session is your friend's session.\n\nYour friend needs to get good because\
  \ he can't actually kill hard bosses. To kill them, he uses skip points. One skip\
  \ point can be used to kill one hard boss.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number\
  \ of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all $n$ bosses\
  \ in the given order.\n\nFor example: suppose $n = 8$, $a = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1,\
  \ 1]$. Then the best course of action is the following:\n\n  your friend kills two\
  \ first bosses, using one skip point for the first boss;  you kill the third and\
  \ the fourth bosses;  your friend kills the fifth boss;  you kill the sixth and\
  \ the seventh bosses;  your friend kills the last boss, using one skip point, so\
  \ the tower is completed using two skip points. \n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent\
  \ test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer\
  \ $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test\
  \ cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1\
  \ \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) — the number of bosses. The second line of the test\
  \ case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 1$), where\
  \ $a_i$ is the type of the $i$-th boss.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$\
  \ does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$ ($\\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\
  \nFor each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of skip points your friend\
  \ needs to use so you and your friend kill all $n$ bosses in the given order.\n\n\
  \n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n8\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n5\n1 1 1 1 0\n7\n1 1 1 1 0 0\
