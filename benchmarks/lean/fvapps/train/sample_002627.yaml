"vc-description": "How many licks does it take to get to the tootsie roll center of\
  \ a tootsie pop?\n\nA group of engineering students from Purdue University reported\
  \ that its licking machine, modeled after a human tongue, took an average of 364\
  \ licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop. Twenty of the group's volunteers\
  \ assumed the licking challenge-unassisted by machinery-and averaged 252 licks each\
  \ to the center.\n\nYour task, if you choose to accept it, is to write a function\
  \ that will return the number of licks it took to get to the tootsie roll center\
  \ of a tootsie pop, given some environmental variables.\n\nEveryone knows it's harder\
  \ to lick a tootsie pop in cold weather but it's easier if the sun is out. You will\
  \ be given an object of environmental conditions for each trial paired with a value\
  \ that will increase or decrease the number of licks. The environmental conditions\
  \ all apply to the same trial.\n\nAssuming that it would normally take 252 licks\
  \ to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop, return the new total of licks\
  \ along with the condition that proved to be most challenging (causing the most\
  \ added licks) in that trial.\n\nExample:\n```\ntotalLicks({ \"freezing temps\"\
  : 10, \"clear skies\": -2 });\n```\nShould return:\n```\n\"It took 260 licks to\
  \ get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop. The toughest challenge was freezing\
  \ temps.\"\n```\nOther cases:\nIf there are no challenges, the toughest challenge\
  \ sentence should be omitted. If there are multiple challenges with the highest\
  \ toughest amount, the first one presented will be the toughest.\nIf an environment\
  \ variable is present, it will be either a positive or negative integer. No need\
  \ to validate.\n\n\nCheck out my other 80's Kids Katas:\n\n\n80's Kids #1: How Many\
