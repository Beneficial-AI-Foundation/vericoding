"vc-description": "Your friend won't stop texting his girlfriend.  It's all he does.\
  \ All day. Seriously.  The texts are so mushy too! The whole situation just makes\
  \ you feel ill.\nBeing the wonderful friend that you are, you hatch an evil plot.\
  \  While he's sleeping, you take his phone and change the autocorrect options so\
  \ that every time he types \"you\" or \"u\" it gets changed to \"your sister.\"\n\
  \nWrite a function called autocorrect that takes a string and replaces all instances\
  \ of \"you\" or \"u\" (not case sensitive) with \"your sister\" (always lower case).\n\
  \nReturn the resulting string.\n\nHere's the slightly tricky part: These are text\
  \ messages, so there are different forms of \"you\" and \"u\".\n\nFor the purposes\
  \ of this kata, here's what you need to support:\n\n\"youuuuu\" with any number\
  \ of u characters tacked onto the end\n\"u\" at the beginning, middle, or end of\
  \ a string, but NOT part of a word\n\"you\" but NOT as part of another word like\
  \ youtube or bayou"
