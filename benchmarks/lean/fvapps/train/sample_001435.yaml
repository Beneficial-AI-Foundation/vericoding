"vc-description": "Chef has  $N$ boxes arranged in a line.Each box has some candies\
  \ in it,say $C[i]$. Chef wants to distribute all the candies between of his friends:\
  \ $A$ and $B$, in the following way:\n$A$ starts eating candies kept in the leftmost\
  \ box(box at $1$st place) and $B$ starts eating candies kept in the rightmost box(box\
  \ at $N$th place). $A$ eats  candies $X$ times faster than $B$ i.e. $A$ eats $X$\
  \ candies when $B$ eats only $1$. Candies in each box can be eaten by only the person\
  \ who reaches that box first. If both reach a box at the same time, then the one\
  \ who has eaten from more number of BOXES till now will eat the candies in that\
  \ box. If both have eaten from the same number of boxes till now ,then $A$ will\
  \ eat the candies in that box.\nFind the number of boxes finished by both $A$ and\
  \ $B$.\nNOTE:- We assume that it does not take any time to switch from one box to\
  \ another.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.\
  \ Then the testcases follow. \n- Each testcase contains three lines of input.\n\
  The first line of each test case contains $N$, the number of boxes.\n- The second\
  \ line of each test case contains a sequence,$C_1$ ,$C_2$ ,$C_3$ . . . $C_N$ where\
  \ $C_i$ denotes the number of candies in the i-th box.  \n- The third line of each\
  \ test case contains an integer $X$ .\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, print\
  \ two space separated integers in a new line - the number of boxes eaten by $A$\
  \  and  $B$ respectively. \n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n-\
  \ $1 \\leq N \\leq 200000$\n- $1 \\leq C_i \\leq 1000000$\n- $1 \\leq X \\leq 10$\n\
  - Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $300000$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n\
  Subtask 1(24 points):\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\\
  leq C_i \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq X \\leq 10$\nSubtask 2(51 points): original constraints\n\
  \n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n5\n2 8 8 2 9\n2\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n4 1\n\
  \n-----EXPLANATION:-----\n$A$ will start eating candies in the 1st box(leftmost\
  \ box having 2 candies) . $B$ will start eating candies in the  5th box(rightmost\
  \ box having 9 candies) .As $A's$ speed is 2 times as that of $B's$, $A$ will start\
  \ eating candies in the  2nd box while $B$ would still be eating candies in the\
  \ 5th box.$A$ will now start eating candies from the 3rd box while $B$ would still\
  \ be eating candies in the 5th box.Now both $A$ and $B$ will finish candies in their\
  \ respective boxes at the same time($A$ from the 3rd box and $B$ from 5th box).\
  \ Since $A$ has eaten more number of boxes($A$ has eaten 3 boxes while $B$ has eaten\
  \ 1 box) till now,so $A$ will be eating candies in the 4th box.\nHence $A$ has eaten\
  \ 4 boxes and $B$ has eaten 1 box."
