"vc-description": "# Base reduction\n\n## Input\n\nA positive integer:\n```\n0 < n\
  \ < 1000000000\n```\n\n## Output\n\nThe end result of the base reduction.\n\nIf\
  \ it cannot be fully reduced (reduced down to a single-digit number), return -1.\n\
  \nAssume that if 150 conversions from base 11 take place in a row, the number cannot\
  \ be fully reduced.\n\n## Description\n\nBase reduction is a process where a number\
  \ is inputted, repeatedly converted into another base, and then outputted if it\
  \ cannot be reduced anymore. If it cannot be fully reduced, return -1.\n\nDuring\
  \ the base conversions, the number is converted from the lowest base it can be converted\
  \ from into base 10. For example, 123 would be converted from base 4 to base 10,\
  \ since base 4 is the lowest base that 123 can be in (123 base 3 is impossible;\
  \ in base 3, there is no digit 3).\n\nIf the lowest possible base the number can\
  \ be converted into is 10, convert the number from base 11 to base 10. For example,\
  \ 53109 would be converted from base 11 to base 10, since base 10 is the lowest\
  \ base it can be in.\n\nIn the end, you should get a number that cannot be reduced\
  \ by this process (a single digit number).\n\n## Example\n\nStarting with 5312:\n\
  ```\n5312 base 6 = 1196 base 10\n1196 base 11 = 1557 base 10\n1557 base 8 = 879\
  \ base 10\n879 base 11 = 1054 base 10\n1054 base 6 = 250 base 10\n250 base 6 = 102\
  \ base 10\n102 base 3 = 11 base 10\n11 base 2 = 3 base 10\n```\nThe output would\
  \ be 3."
