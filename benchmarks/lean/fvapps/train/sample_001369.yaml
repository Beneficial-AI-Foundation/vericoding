"vc-description": "In an array, a $block$ is a maximal sequence of identical elements.\
  \ Since blocks are maximal, adjacent blocks have distinct elements, so the array\
  \ breaks up into a series of blocks.  For example, given the array $[3, 3, 2, 2,\
  \ 2, 1, 5, 8, 4, 4]$, there are 6 blocks: $[3, 3], [2, 2, 2], [1], [5], [8], [4,\
  \ 4]$ . \nIn this task, you are given two arrays, $A$ (of length $n$), and $B$ (of\
  \ length $m$), and a number $K$. You have to interleave $A$ and $B$ to form an array\
  \ $C$ such that $C$ has $K$ blocks. Each way of interleaving $A$ and $B$ can be\
  \ represented as a $0-1$ array $X$ of length $n+m$ in which $X[j]$ is $0$ if $C[j]$\
  \ came from $A$ and $X[j]$ is $1$ if $C[j]$ came from $B$.\nA formal description\
  \ of the interleaving process is given at the end.\nFor example, if $A = [1, 3]$\
  \ and $B = [3, 4]$, there are $6$ ways of interleaving $A$ and $B$.  With each interleaving\
  \ $X$ of $A$ and $B$, we also count the number of blocks in the resulting interleaved\
  \ array $C$.  The descriptions of the interleavings, $X$, and the outcomes, $C$,\
  \ are given below.\n- $X = [0, 0, 1, 1]$, which corresponds to $C = [1, 3, 3, 4]$,\
  \ $3$ blocks.\n- $X = [0, 1, 0, 1]$, which corresponds to $C = [1, 3, 3, 4]$, $3$\
  \ blocks.\n- $X = [0, 1, 1, 0]$, which corresponds to $C = [1, 3, 4, 3]$ , $4$ blocks.\n\
  - $X = [1, 0, 0, 1]$, which corresponds to $C = [3, 1, 3, 4]$, $4$ blocks.\n- $X\
  \ = [1, 0, 1, 0]$, which corresponds to $C = [3, 1, 4, 3]$, $4$ blocks.\n- $X =\
  \ [1, 1, 0, 0]$, which corresponds to $C = [3, 4, 1, 3]$, $4$ blocks.\nObserve that\
  \ different interleavings $X$ may produce the same array $C$, such as the first\
  \ two interleavings in the example above.\nYour task is the following.  Given arrays\
  \ $A$ and $B$ and a number $K$, find the number of different interleavings $X$ of\
  \ $A$ and $B$ that produce an output array $C$ with exactly $K$ blocks.  Note that\
  \ we are counting the number of interleavings, not the number of different output\
  \ arrays after interleaving.  For instance, if the same output array C is produced\
  \ via 2 different interleavings, it gets counted twice.\nSince the answer might\
  \ be large, print the answer modulo $10^8 + 7$.\nHere is a formal definition of\
  \ the interleaving process:\nSuppose $A = A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$ and $B = B_1, B_2,\
  \ ..., B_m$. Then, the process of generating an interleaving $C$ can be described\
  \ using an array $X$ of size $n + m$, with exactly $n$ $0's$ and $m$ $1's$.  Suppose\
  \ we have such an array $X = X_1, X_2, ..., X_{n+m}$. Using this array $X$, we create\
  \ the output array $C = C_1, C_2, ..., C_{n+m}$, using the following algorithm:\n\
  i = 0, j = 0\nwhile( (i+j)<(n+m) )\nif(X[i+j+1] == 0)\nC[i+j+1] = A[i+1]\ni = i+1\n\
  else\nC[i+j+1] = B[j+1]\nj = j+1\n\nThus if the $X$ value is $0$, we pick the next\
  \ available element from $A$ into $C$, and if it is $1$, we pick from $B$ instead.\
  \ This creates an interleaving of the arrays $A$ and $B$.\n\n-----Input Format:-----\n\
  - The first line contains a single integer, $T$, which is the number of testcases.\
  \ The description of each testcase follows.\n- The first line of each testcase contains\
  \ three integers: $n$, $m$, and $K$, which denote the size of array $A$, the size\
  \ of array $B$, and the required number of blocks in $C$, respectively.\n- The next\
  \ line contains $n$ integers, which represent the array $A$.\n- The next line contains\
  \ $m$ integers, which represent the array $B$.\n\n-----Output Format:-----\n- You\
  \ should print the answer in a new line for each testcase, which should be the number\
  \ of valid interleaving arrays $X$ which correspond to an output array $C$ with\
  \ $K$ blocks, modulo $10^8 + 7$.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n\
  - $1 \\leq n \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq m \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq n+m$\n- $0\
  \ \\leq A_i, B_j \\leq 10^9$\n\n-----Subtasks:-----\n- Subtask 1: 10% points: $m\
  \ = 1$\n- Subtask 2: 30% points: $0 \\leq A_i, B_j \\leq 1$\n- Subtask 3: 60% points:\
  \ Original constraints.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n5\n2 2 4\n1 3\n3 4\n2 2 3\n\
  1 3\n3 4\n2 2 2\n1 3\n3 4\n2 2 4\n4 7\n8 5\n2 2 2\n4 7\n8 5\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n\
  4\n2\n0\n6\n0\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- The first three testcases correspond\
  \ to the example given in the problem statement. Of the $6$ interleavings, $4$ produce\
  \ outputs with $4$ blocks and $2$ produce outputs with $3$ blocks.  Hence, for $K\
  \ = 4$, the answer is $4$, for $K = 3$, the answer is $2$, and for $K = 2$, the\
  \ answer is $0$.\n- The fourth and fifth testcases have $A = [4, 7]$ and $B = [8,\
  \ 5]$.  Here are the $6$ interleavings of these two arrays.\n- $X = [0, 0, 1, 1]$,\
  \ which corresponds to $C= [4, 7, 8, 5]$, $4$ blocks.\n- $X = [0, 1, 0, 1]$, which\
  \ corresponds to $C= [4, 8, 7, 5]$, $4$ blocks.\n- $X = [0, 1, 1, 0]$, which corresponds\
  \ to $C= [4, 8, 5, 7]$, $4$ blocks.\n- $X = [1, 0, 0, 1]$, which corresponds to\
  \ $C= [8, 4, 7, 5]$, $4$ blocks.\n- $X = [1, 0, 1, 0]$, which corresponds to $C=\
  \ [8, 4, 5, 7]$, $4$ blocks.\n- $X = [1, 1, 0, 0]$, which corresponds to $C= [8,\
  \ 5, 4, 7]$, $4$ blocks.\nAll $6$ interleavings produce outputs with $4$ blocks,\
  \ so for $K = 4$ the answer is $6$ and for any other value of $K$, the answer is\
  \ $0$."
