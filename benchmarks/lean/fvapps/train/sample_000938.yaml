"vc-description": "Since due to COVID 19, India has undergone a complete 21 day lockdown.\
  \ So Amol was attending an online lecture where his professor asked him to solve\
  \ a question. Amol was unable to solve the question so he asked you to solve the\
  \ question and give him the correct answer. \n\nThe question was asked a such that\
  \ his professor gave him a number M and a list of integers of length N (i.e. A1,\
  \ A2,..... AN) and you have to find out all the subsets that add up to M and the\
  \ total number of subsets will be the final answer. \n\nInput: \n• The first line\
  \ of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The\
  \ description of T test cases follows. \n\n• The first line of each test case contains\
  \ a single integer N. \n\n• The second line of each test case contains a single\
  \ integer M. \n\n• The third line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2,.....\
  \ AN. \n\nOutput: \nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer\
  \ ― the no. of subsets that adds upto M.\n\nConstraints: \n• 1≤T≤5\n\n• 1≤N≤100\
  \ \n\n• 10≤M≤100 \n\n• 1≤Ai≤100\n\nExampleInput:\n\n2\n\n4\n\n16\n\n2 4 6 10 \n\n\
  4 \n\n20 \n\n2 8 12 10 \n\nOutput:\n\n2\n\n2\n\nExplanation:\nIn the 1st example\
  \ there are two subsets {2,4,10} and {6,10} that adds upto 16 so the output is 2."
