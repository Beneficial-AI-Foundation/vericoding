"vc-description": "### The Story:\nBob is working as a bus driver. However, he has\
  \ become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers\
  \ wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough\
  \ space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he\
  \ will be able to fit all the passengers.\n\n### Task Overview:\n\nYou have to write\
  \ a function that accepts three parameters: \n* `cap` is the amount of people the\
  \ bus can hold excluding the driver.\n* `on` is the number of people on the bus.\n\
  * `wait` is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus. \n\nIf there is enough\
  \ space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't\
  \ take.\n\n### Usage Examples:\n\n```python\nenough(10, 5, 5)\n0 # He can fit all\
  \ 5 passengers\nenough(100, 60, 50)\n10 # He can't fit 10 out of 50 waiting\n```\n\
  \n```if:csharp\nDocumentation:\nKata.Enough Method (Int32, Int32, Int32)\n\nReturns\
  \ the number of passengers the bus cannot fit, or 0 if the bus can fit every passenger.\n\
  \nSyntax\n\n\npublic\nstatic\nint Enough(\nint cap,\n    int on,\nint wait\n    )\n\
  \  \n\n\n\nParameters\n\ncap\n\nType: System.Int32\nThe amount of people that can\
  \ fit on the bus excluding the driver.\n\non\n\nType: System.Int32\nThe amount of\
  \ people on the bus excluding the driver.\n\nwait\n\nType: System.Int32\nThe amount\
  \ of people waiting to enter the bus.\n\nReturn Value\n\nType: System.Int32\n  An\
  \ integer representing how many passengers cannot fit on the bus, or 0 if every\
  \ passenger can fit on the bus.\n\n```"
