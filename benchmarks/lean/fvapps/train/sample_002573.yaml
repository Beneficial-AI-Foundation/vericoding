"vc-description": "# Story&Task\n There are three parties in parliament. The \"Conservative\
  \ Party\", the \"Reformist Party\", and a group of independants.\n\n You are a member\
  \ of the “Conservative Party” and you party is trying to pass a bill. The “Reformist\
  \ Party” is trying to block it.\n\n In order for a bill to pass, it must have a\
  \ majority vote, meaning that more than half of all members must approve of a bill\
  \ before it is passed . The \"Conservatives\" and \"Reformists\" always vote the\
  \ same as other members of thier parties, meaning that all the members of each party\
  \ will all vote yes, or all vote no .\n\n However, independants vote individually,\
  \ and the independant vote is often the determining factor as to whether a bill\
  \ gets passed or not.\n\n Your task is to find the minimum number of independents\
  \ that have to vote for your party's (the Conservative Party's) bill so that it\
  \ is passed .\n\n In each test case the makeup of the Parliament will be different\
  \ . In some cases your party may make up the majority of parliament, and in others\
  \ it may make up the minority. If your party is the majority, you may find that\
  \ you do not neeed any independants to vote in favor of your bill in order for it\
  \ to pass . If your party is the minority, it may be possible that there are not\
  \ enough independants for your bill to be passed . If it is impossible for your\
  \ bill to pass, return `-1`.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `totalMembers`\n\
  \n  The total number of members.\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `conservativePartyMembers`\n\
  \n  The number of members in the Conservative Party.\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `reformistPartyMembers`\n\
  \n  The number of members in the Reformist Party.\n\n \n - `[output]` an integer\n\
  \n  The minimum number of independent members that have to vote as you wish so that\
  \ the bill is passed, or `-1` if you can't pass it anyway.\n  \n# Example\n\n For\
  \ `n = 8, m = 3 and k = 3`, the output should be `2`.\n \n It means: \n ```\n Conservative\
  \ Party member --> 3\n Reformist Party member   --> 3\n the independent members\
  \ --> 8 - 3 - 3 = 2\n If 2 independent members change their minds\n 3 + 2 > 3\n\
  \ the bill will be passed.\n If 1 independent members change their minds\n perhaps\
  \ the bill will be failed\n (If the other independent members is against the bill).\n\
  \ 3 + 1 <= 3 + 1\n ```\n \n For `n = 13, m = 4 and k = 7`, the output should be\
  \ `-1`.\n ```\n Even if all 2 independent members support the bill\n there are still\
  \ not enough votes to pass the bill\n 4 + 2 < 7\n So the output is -1\n ```"
