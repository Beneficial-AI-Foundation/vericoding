"vc-description": "You and your friends have been battling it out with your Rock 'Em,\
  \ Sock 'Em robots, but things have gotten a little boring. You've each decided to\
  \ add some amazing new features to your robot and automate them to battle to the\
  \ death.\n\nEach robot will be represented by an object. You will be given two robot\
  \ objects, and an object of battle tactics and how much damage they produce. Each\
  \ robot will have a name, hit points, speed, and then a list of battle tacitcs they\
  \ are to perform in order. Whichever robot has the best speed, will attack first\
  \ with one battle tactic. \n\nYour job is to decide who wins.\n\nExample:\n```python\n\
  \ robot_1 = {\n  \"name\": \"Rocky\",\n  \"health\": 100,\n  \"speed\": 20,\n  \"\
  tactics\": [\"punch\", \"punch\", \"laser\", \"missile\"]\n }\n robot_2 = {\n  \
  \ \"name\": \"Missile Bob\",\n   \"health\": 100,\n   \"speed\": 21,\n   \"tactics\"\
  : [\"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\", \"missile\"]\n }\n tactics = {\n   \"\
  punch\": 20,\n   \"laser\": 30,\n   \"missile\": 35\n }\n \n fight(robot_1, robot_2,\
  \ tactics) -> \"Missile Bob has won the fight.\"\n```\n\nrobot2 uses the first tactic,\
  \ \"missile\" because he has the most speed. This reduces robot1's health by 35.\
  \ Now robot1 uses a punch, and so on. \n\n**Rules**\n\n- A robot with the most speed\
  \ attacks first. If they are tied, the first robot passed in attacks first.\n- Robots\
  \ alternate turns attacking. Tactics are used in order.\n- A fight is over when\
  \ a robot has 0 or less health or both robots have run out of tactics.\n- A robot\
  \ who has no tactics left does no more damage, but the other robot may use the rest\
  \ of his tactics.\n- If both robots run out of tactics, whoever has the most health\
  \ wins. Return the message \"{Name} has won the fight.\"\n- If both robots run out\
  \ of tactics and are tied for health, the fight is a draw. Return \"The fight was\
  \ a draw.\"\n\n**To Java warriors**\n\n`Robot` class is immutable.\n\n\nCheck out\
