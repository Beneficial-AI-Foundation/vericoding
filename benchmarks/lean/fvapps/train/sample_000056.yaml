"vc-description": "A mad scientist Dr.Jubal has made a competitive programming task.\
  \ Try to solve it!\n\nYou are given integers $n,k$. Construct a grid $A$ with size\
  \ $n \\times n$ consisting of integers $0$ and $1$. The very important condition\
  \ should be satisfied: the sum of all elements in the grid is exactly $k$. In other\
  \ words, the number of $1$ in the grid is equal to $k$.\n\nLet's define:  $A_{i,j}$\
  \ as the integer in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column.  $R_i = A_{i,1}+A_{i,2}+...+A_{i,n}$\
  \ (for all $1 \\le i \\le n$).  $C_j = A_{1,j}+A_{2,j}+...+A_{n,j}$ (for all $1\
  \ \\le j \\le n$).  In other words, $R_i$ are row sums and $C_j$ are column sums\
  \ of the grid $A$.  For the grid $A$ let's define the value $f(A) = (\\max(R)-\\\
  min(R))^2 + (\\max(C)-\\min(C))^2$ (here for an integer sequence $X$ we define $\\\
  max(X)$ as the maximum value in $X$ and $\\min(X)$ as the minimum value in $X$).\
  \ \n\nFind any grid $A$, which satisfies the following condition. Among such grids\
  \ find any, for which the value $f(A)$ is the minimum possible. Among such tables,\
  \ you can find any.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test\
  \ cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) — the\
  \ number of test cases. Next $t$ lines contain descriptions of test cases.\n\nFor\
  \ each test case the only line contains two integers $n$, $k$ $(1 \\le n \\le 300,\
  \ 0 \\le k \\le n^2)$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n^2$ for all test cases\
  \ does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, firstly print\
  \ the minimum possible value of $f(A)$ among all tables, for which the condition\
  \ is satisfied.\n\nAfter that, print $n$ lines contain $n$ characters each. The\
  \ $j$-th character in the $i$-th line should be equal to $A_{i,j}$.\n\nIf there\
  \ are multiple answers you can print any.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n2 2\n\
  3 8\n1 0\n4 16\n\nOutput\n0\n10\n01\n2\n111\n111\n101\n0\n0\n0\n1111\n1111\n1111\n\
  1111\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, the sum of all elements in\
  \ the grid is equal to $2$, so the condition is satisfied. $R_1 = 1, R_2 = 1$ and\
  \ $C_1 = 1, C_2 = 1$. Then, $f(A) = (1-1)^2 + (1-1)^2 = 0$, which is the minimum\
  \ possible value of $f(A)$.\n\nIn the second test case, the sum of all elements\
  \ in the grid is equal to $8$, so the condition is satisfied. $R_1 = 3, R_2 = 3,\
  \ R_3 = 2$ and $C_1 = 3, C_2 = 2, C_3 = 3$. Then, $f(A) = (3-2)^2 + (3-2)^2 = 2$.\
  \ It can be proven, that it is the minimum possible value of $f(A)$."
