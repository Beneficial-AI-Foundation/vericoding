"vc-description": "There are three squares, each with side length a placed on the\
  \ x-axis. The coordinates of centers of these squares are (x1, a/2), (x2, a/2) and\
  \ (x3, a/2) respectively. All of them are placed with one of their sides resting\
  \ on the x-axis.\nYou are allowed to move the centers of each of these squares along\
  \ the x-axis (either to the left or to the right)  by a distance of at most K. Find\
  \ the maximum possible area of intersections of all these three squares that you\
  \ can achieve. That is, the maximum area of the region which is part of all the\
  \ three squares in the final configuration.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line\
  \ of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The\
  \ description of T test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains\
  \ two space-separated integers a, K denoting side length of the squares, and the\
  \ maximum distance that you can move the center of any square.\n- The second line\
  \ contains three space separated integers x1, x2, x3\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each\
  \ test case, output a real number corresponding to the maximum area of the intersection\
  \ of the three squares that you can obtain. Your answer will be considered correct\
  \ if it has an absolute error of less than or equal to \t10-2.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n\
  - 1 ≤ T ≤ 105\n- 1 ≤ a ≤ 105\n- 0 ≤ K ≤ 106\n- -106 ≤ x1, x2, x3 ≤ 106\n\n-----Example-----\n\

  -----Explanation-----\nTestcase 1: The figure below shows the three squares:\n\n\
  Since K = 0, they cannot be moved, and since there is no region which belongs to\
  \ all three squares, the answer is 0.\nTestcase 2: The starting configuration is\
  \ the same as above, but now each of the squares can move 1 unit. So we can move\
  \ the first square 1 unit to the right and the third square one unit to the left,\
  \ and have all the three squares at x-coordinate = 2. Thus the entire square is\
  \ part of all three squares, and the answer is 1."
