"vc-description": "There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned\
  \ a rating value.\n\nYou are giving candies to these children subjected to the following\
  \ requirements:\n\n\n       Each child must have at least one candy.\n       Children\
  \ with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.\n\n\nWhat is the minimum\
  \ candies you must give?\n\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: [1,0,2]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\
  \ You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.\n\
  \n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: [1,2,2]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: You can allocate to\
  \ the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.\n       \
