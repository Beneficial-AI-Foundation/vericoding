"vc-description": "Kate likes to count words in text blocks. By words she means continuous\
  \ sequences of English alphabetic characters (from a to z ). Here are examples:\n\
  \n`Hello there, little user5453 374 ())$. I’d been using my sphere as a stool. Slow-moving\
  \ target 839342 was hit by OMGd-63 or K4mp.` contains \"words\" `['Hello', 'there',\
  \ 'little', 'user', 'I', 'd', 'been', 'using', 'my','sphere', 'as', 'a', 'stool',\
  \ 'Slow', 'moving', 'target', 'was', 'hit', 'by', 'OMGd', 'or', 'K', 'mp']`\n\n\
  Kate doesn't like some of words and doesn't count them. Words to be excluded are\
  \ \"a\", \"the\", \"on\", \"at\", \"of\", \"upon\", \"in\" and \"as\", case-insensitive.\n\
  \nToday Kate's too lazy and have decided to teach her computer to count \"words\"\
  \ for her.\n\n\nExample Input 1\n-------------\nHello there, little user5453 374\
  \ ())$.\n\nExample Output 1\n-------------\n4\n\nExample Input 2\n-------------\n\
  \n  I’d been using my sphere as a stool. I traced counterclockwise circles on it\
  \ with my fingertips and it shrank until I could palm it. My bolt had shifted while\
  \ I’d been sitting. I pulled it up and yanked the pleats straight as I careered\
  \ around tables, chairs, globes, and slow-moving fraas. I passed under a stone arch\
  \ into the Scriptorium. The place smelled richly of ink. Maybe it was because an\
  \ ancient fraa and his two fids were copying out books there. But I wondered how\
  \ long it would take to stop smelling that way if no one ever used it at all; a\
  \ lot of ink had been spent there, and the wet smell of it must be deep into everything.\n\
