"vc-description": "Chef has a circular plot of land of radius $R$ on which he wants\
  \ to construct a swimming pool.\nHe wants the swimming pool to be square in shape\
  \ with maximum possible area,so that he along\nwith his friends can enjoy themselves\
  \ during their summer vacations.\nHelp Chef to find out the maximum area of the\
  \ swimming pool that can be constructed in his \ncircular plot.\n\n-----Input:-----\n\
  - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n\
  - Each testcase contains of a single line of input,  $R$ i.e the radius of the plot.\
