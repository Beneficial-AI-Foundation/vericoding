"vc-description": "This is a beginner friendly kata especially for UFC/MMA fans. \n\
  \nIt's a fight between the two legends: Conor McGregor vs George Saint Pierre in\
  \ Madison Square Garden. Only one fighter will remain standing, and after the fight\
  \ in an interview with Joe Rogan the winner will make his legendary statement. It's\
  \ your job to return the right statement depending on the winner!\n\nIf the winner\
  \ is George Saint Pierre he will obviously say:\n- \"I am not impressed by your\
  \ performance.\"\n\nIf the winner is Conor McGregor he will most undoubtedly say:\n\
  - \"I'd like to take this chance to apologize.. To absolutely NOBODY!\"\n\nGood\
  \ Luck!"
