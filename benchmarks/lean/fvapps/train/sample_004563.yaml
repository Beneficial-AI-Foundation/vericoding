"vc-description": "John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He's heard that \n\
  making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds.\
  \ \nHe wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.\n\nJohn knows that the rectangular\
  \ room has a length of `l` meters, a width of `w` meters, a height of `h` meters.\n\
  The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is `52` centimeters. The \nlength\
  \ of a roll is `10` meters.\nHe bears in mind however, that it’s best to have an\
  \ extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants\
  \ to buy a length `15%` greater than the one he needs.\n\nLast time he did these\
  \ calculations he got a headache, so could you help John? Your function `wallpaper(l,\
  \ w, h)` should return as a plain English word\nin lower case the number of rolls\
  \ he must buy.\n\n### Example:\n\n`wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return \"ten\"\
  `\n\n`wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return \"zero\"`\n\n# Notes:\n- all rolls\
  \ (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge \n- 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers),\
  \ it can happens that `w x h x l` is zero\n- the integer `r` (number of rolls) will\
  \ always be less or equal to 20\n\n\n- FORTH: the number of rolls will be a *positive\
  \ or null integer* (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)"
