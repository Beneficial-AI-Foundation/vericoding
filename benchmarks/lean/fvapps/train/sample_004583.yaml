"vc-description": "# Task\n Imagine a white rectangular grid of `n` rows and `m` columns\
  \ divided into two parts by a diagonal line running from the upper left to the lower\
  \ right corner. Now let's paint the grid in two colors according to the following\
  \ rules:\n```\n A cell is painted black if it has at least one point in common with\
  \ the diagonal;\nOtherwise, a cell is painted white.\n```\n Count the number of\
  \ cells painted black.\n\n# Example\n\n For n = 3 and m = 4, the output should be\
  \ `6`\n\n There are 6 cells that have at least one common point with the diagonal\
  \ and therefore are painted black.\n\n For n = 3 and m = 3, the output should be\
  \ `7`\n\n 7 cells have at least one common point with the diagonal and are painted\
  \ black.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` integer `n`\n\n   The number of rows.\n\
  \n   Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10000.\n\n - `[input]` integer `m`\n\n   The number of\
  \ columns.\n\n   Constraints: 1 ≤ m ≤ 10000.\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n   The\
  \ number of black cells."
