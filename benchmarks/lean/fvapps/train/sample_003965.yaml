"vc-description": "# Task\n Changu and Mangu are great buddies. Once they found an\
  \ infinite paper which had 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,......... till infinity, written on it.\n\
  \n Both of them did not like the sequence and started deleting some numbers in the\
  \ following way.\n ```\nFirst they deleted every 2nd number.\nSo remaining numbers\
  \ on the paper: 1,3,5,7,9,11..........till infinity.\nThen they deleted every 3rd\
  \ number.\nSo remaining numbers on the paper: 1,3,7,9,13,15..........till infinity..\n\
  Then they deleted every 4th number.\nSo remaining numbers on the paper: 1,3,7,13,15..........till\
  \ infinity.```\nThen kept on doing this (deleting every 5th, then every 6th ...)\
  \ untill they got old and died.\n\n It is obvious that some of the numbers will\
  \ never get deleted(E.g. 1,3,7,13..) and hence are know to us as survivor numbers.\n\
  \n Given a number `n`, check whether its a survivor number or not.\n\n# Input/Output\n\
  \n\n - `[input]` integer `n`\n\n  `0 < n <= 10^8`\n\n \n - `[output]` a boolean\
  \ value\n\n  `true` if the number is a survivor else `false`."
