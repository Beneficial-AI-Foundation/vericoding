"vc-description": "The MarkiT online virtual market startup wants to organize its\
  \ grand opening in NIT Patna.\nbut they want maximum crowd for their inauguration.\
  \ So the manager told  this  to Praveen a student in NITP who suggested them:\n\
  The first-year students come to campus  every x hour,\nSecond-year students come\
  \ to campus every y hour,\nThird-year students come to campus every z hour and \n\
  Fourth-year is very busy so they don't come regularly.\nSo Praveen being very clever\
  \ told him the no of times in n days he can have an audience of all year student\
  \ (1st,2nd & 3rd) at max. So can you code what Praveen has done?\n\n-----Input:-----\n\
  - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n\
  - Each testcase contains of a 2 line of input, first line contain one  integers\
  \ $N$ (No of Days). \n-Next line contain 3 space separated integer the  value of\
  \ x y z\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer\
  \ the no of times audience consists of all year.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1\
  \ \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^8$\n- $1 \\leq x,y,z \\leq 10^5$\n\n\
  -----Sample Input:-----\n1\n10\n8 10 6\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n2\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\n\
  First favourable condition will come on 5th day and Second on 10th day."
