"vc-description": "In Finite Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (FEIS), all integer\
  \ sequences of lengths between 1 and N (inclusive) consisting of integers between\
  \ 1 and K (inclusive) are listed.\nLet the total number of sequences listed in FEIS\
  \ be X. Among those sequences, find the (X/2)-th (rounded up to the nearest integer)\
  \ lexicographically smallest one.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N,K \\leq\
  \ 3 × 10^5\n - N and K are integers.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard\
  \ Input in the following format:\nK N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the (X/2)-th (rounded\
  \ up to the nearest integer) lexicographically smallest sequence listed in FEIS,\
  \ with spaces in between, where X is the total number of sequences listed in FEIS.\n\
  \n-----Sample Input-----\n3 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n2 1 \n\nThere are 12 sequences\
  \ listed in FEIS: (1),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3).\n\
  The (12/2 = 6)-th lexicographically smallest one among them is (2,1)."
