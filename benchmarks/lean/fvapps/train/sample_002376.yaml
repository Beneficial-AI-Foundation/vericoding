"vc-description": "The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs\
  \ a change folder operation.\nThe operations are described below:\n\n\"../\" : Move\
  \ to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder,\
  \ remain in the same folder).\n\"./\" : Remain in the same folder.\n\"x/\" : Move\
  \ to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).\n\nYou\
  \ are given a list of strings logs where logs[i] is the operation performed by the\
  \ user at the ith step.\nThe file system starts in the main folder, then the operations\
  \ in logs are performed.\nReturn the minimum number of operations needed to go back\
  \ to the main folder after the change folder operations.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput:\
  \ logs = [\"d1/\",\"d2/\",\"../\",\"d21/\",\"./\"]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Use\
  \ this change folder operation \"../\" 2 times and go back to the main folder.\n\
  \nExample 2:\n\nInput: logs = [\"d1/\",\"d2/\",\"./\",\"d3/\",\"../\",\"d31/\"]\n\
  Output: 3\n\nExample 3:\nInput: logs = [\"d1/\",\"../\",\"../\",\"../\"]\nOutput:\
  \ 0\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= logs.length <= 103\n2 <= logs[i].length <= 10\nlogs[i]\
  \ contains lowercase English letters, digits, '.', and '/'.\nlogs[i] follows the\
  \ format described in the statement.\nFolder names consist of lowercase English\
  \ letters and digits."
