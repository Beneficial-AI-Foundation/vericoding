"vc-description": "As a strict big brother, I do limit my young brother Vasya on time\
  \ he spends on computer games. I define a prime-time as a time period till which\
  \ Vasya have a permission to play computer games. I specify start hour and end hour\
  \ as pair of integers.\n\nI need a function which will take three numbers - a present\
  \ moment (current hour), a start hour of allowed time period and an end hour of\
  \ allowed time period. The function should give answer to a question (as a boolean):\
  \ \"Can Vasya play in specified time?\"\n\nIf I say that prime-time is from 12 till\
  \ 15 that means that at 12:00 it's OK to play computer but at 15:00 there should\
  \ be no more games.\n\nI will allow Vasya to play at least one hour a day."
