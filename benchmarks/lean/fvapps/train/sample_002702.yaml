"vc-description": "## Task\n An `ATM` ran out of 10 dollar bills and only has `100,\
  \ 50 and 20` dollar bills.\n \n Given an amount between `40 and 10000 dollars (inclusive)`\
  \ and assuming that the ATM wants to use as few bills as possible, determinate the\
  \ minimal number of 100, 50 and 20 dollar bills the ATM needs to dispense (in that\
  \ order).\n\n## Example\n\n For `n = 250`, the result should be `[2, 1, 0]`.\n \n\
  \ For `n = 260`, the result should be `[2, 0, 3]`.\n \n For `n = 370`, the result\
  \ should be `[3, 1, 1]`.\n\n## Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` integer `n`\n  Amount\
  \ of money to withdraw. Assume that `n` is always exchangeable with `[100, 50, 20]`\
  \ bills.\n - `[output]` integer array\n  An array of number of `100, 50 and 20`\
  \ dollar bills needed to complete the withdraw (in that order)."
