"vc-description": "The  Chef  has bought $N$ boxes of Tiles. The number of tiles present\
  \ in  $i^{th}$ box is  $i$  ($i   $ varies from $1$ to $N$) . The Chef  has two\
  \ houses  with  $N$  rooms  each, whose  floors  is a square with area $(i*i)$ ,i\
  \ varies from $(1....N)$. He want to distribute equal number of tiles from $i^{th}$\
  \ box to any two rooms (each room must belong to one house ) such that all tiles\
  \  of $i^ { th}$  box is used and floor of  both rooms of different houses are tiled\
  \ completely.\nSince chef is busy doing some other works so he wants your help to\
  \ count the total number of rooms of both houses that will be tiled completely.\n\
  Note $:$ size of  each tile present in boxes has length and breadth equal to $1$.\
  \ It is not mandatory to use all the boxes.\nA room should be tilled completely\
  \ from a single box.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number\
  \ of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Each testcase contains one integer\
  \ $N$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase print  the total number of rooms\
  \ of both houses that will be tiled completely.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\\
  leq T \\leq 5000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^{12}$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n16\n\
  \n-----Sample Output:-----\n4\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nThe room $1$ and $2$ of\
  \ both the houses are completely tiled."
