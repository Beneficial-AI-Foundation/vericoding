"vc-description": "Due to COVID19 all employees of chemical factory are quarantined\
  \ in home. So, company is organized by automated robots. There are $N$ Containers\
  \ in company, which are labelled with $1$ to $N$ numbers. There are Total $N$ robots\
  \ in Company, which are labelled $1$ to $N$. \nEach Robot adds $1$ litter Chemical\
  \ in containers whose labels are multiple of robots’ label. (E.g. robot labelled\
  \ 2 will add Chemical in containers labelled 2, 4, 6, ….). \nRobots follow few rules\
  \ mentioned below:\n- Chemical with $pH<7$ is acidic.\n- Chemical with $pH=7$ is\
  \ neutral.\n- Chemical with $pH>7$ is basic.\n- Mixture of $1$ litter acid and $1$\
  \ litter base makes neutral solution.\n- If Container is empty or pH of Chemical\
  \ in container is equal to \n- $7$ then robot adds $1$ litter acidic Chemical.\n\
  - If pH of Chemical in container is less than $7$ then robots adds $1$ litter basic\
  \ Chemical.\nNow Chemical is packed in $4$ ways:\n- Containers with exactly $2$\
  \ litter acid and $1$ litter base are packed at $P1$ cost. \n- Containers with acidic\
  \ Chemical are packed at $P2$ cost. (Here Don’t consider containers with exactly\
  \ $2$ litter acid and $1$ litter base as we counted them in above rule)\n- Containers\
  \ with $pH=7$ Chemical is packed at $P3$ cost.\n- Containers with Basic Chemical\
  \ are packed at $P4$ cost.\nNow $1$ employee given task to find packing cost of\
  \ containers with labels in range $[ k1, k2]$ (Inclusive). Help him out. As Cost\
  \ can be large find cost in modulo of $100000007$\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first\
  \ line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\
  \ The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case\
  \ contains $3$ space separated Integers $N$, $K1$ and $K2$.\n- The second and last\
  \ line contains $4$ space separated Integers $P1$, $P2$, $P3$ and $P4$\n\n-----Output:-----\n\
  For each test case, print total cost of packing of containers modulo 100000007.\n\

  \ Chemical, \n1 for Chemical with pH=7, \n2 for basic Chemical,\n3 for Containers\
  \ with exactly 2 litter acid and 1 litter base,\n-1 for empty containers\nInitially\
  \ 4 containers are empty so\n[-1, -1, -1, -1]\nRobot 1 adds 1 litter acid in all\
  \ containers.\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\nRobot 2 adds base in containers labelled 2, 4\n[0,\
  \ 1, 0, 1]\nRobot 3 adds base in containers labelled 3\n[0, 1, 1, 1]\nRobot 4 adds\
  \ acid in containers labelled 4 because it contains Chemical with pH=7. After adding\
  \ acid, it also contains exactly 2 litter acid and 1 litter base, so denoting it\
  \ with 3.\n[0, 1, 1, 3]\nCorresponding cost of packing container\n[P2, P3, P3, P1]\n\
  Now, calculate total cost,\nCost = P2+P3+P3+P1 = 2+2+2+2 = 8"
