"vc-description": "Every great chef knows that lucky numbers are positive integers\
  \ whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example,\
  \ numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.  \n\nOur chef has recently\
  \ returned from the Lucky country. He observed that every restaurant in the Lucky\
  \ country had a lucky number as its name. \nHe believes that having a lucky number\
  \ as a restaurant name can indeed turn out to be very lucky.  \n\nOur chef believes\
  \ that it is possible to make a lucky number having N digits even luckier. Any number\
  \ following the rules below is called Lucky lucky number -  \n\n1. The number contains\
  \ only digits 4 and 7. \n\n2. Count of digit 4 in the number should be divisible\
  \ by 7. \n\n3. Count of digit 7 in the number should be divisible by 4. \n\nHelp\
  \ our chef to compute the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having\
  \ N digits. \n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line contains T, number of test cases.\
  \ Each of the next T lines contains a number N, the number of digits in the Lucky\
  \ lucky number to be formed. \n\n1<=T<=1000 \n\n1<=N<=1000000000 (10^9) \n\n-----Output-----\n\
  \nIf it is not possible to form a Lucky lucky number having N digits, output -1.\n\
  Otherwise, output the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having\
  \ N digits.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n5\n7\n4\n11\n1\n15\n\nOutput:\n7\n0\n\
  7\n-1\n7\n\nExplanation\nFor the last test case, N = 15, the smallest lucky lucky\
  \ number is\n444444477777777. The count of digit 4 is 7."
