"vc-description": "As a member of the editorial board of the prestigous scientific\
  \ Journal _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, you've decided to go\
  \ back and review how well old articles you've published stand up to modern publication\
  \ best practices. Specifically, you'd like to re-evaluate old findings in light\
  \ of recent literature about [\"researcher degrees of freedom\"](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611417632).\n\
  \nYou want to categorize all the old articles into three groups: \"Fine\", \"Needs\
  \ review\" and \"Pants on fire\".\n\nIn order to categorize them you've enlisted\
  \ an army of unpaid grad students to review and give you two data points from each\
  \ study: (1) the p-value behind the paper's primary conclusions, and (2) the number\
  \ of recommended author requirements to limit researcher degrees of freedom the\
  \ authors satisfied:\n\n    * Authors must decide the rule for terminating data\
  \ collection before data collection begins and report this rule in the article.\n\
  \    * Authors must collect at least 20 observations per cell or else provide a\
  \ compelling cost-of-data-collection justification. \n    * Authors must list all\
  \ variables collected in a study.\n    * Authors must report all experimental conditions,\
  \ including failed manipulations.\n    * If observations are eliminated, authors\
  \ must also report what the statistical results are if those observations are included.\n\
  \    * If an analysis includes a covariate, authors must report the statistical\
  \ results of the analysis without the covariate.\n    \nYour army of tenure-hungry\
  \ grad students will give you the p-value as a float between `1.0` and `0.0` exclusive,\
  \ and the number of author requirements satisfied as an integer from `0` through\
  \ `6` inclusive.\n\nYou've decided to write a function, `categorize_study()` to\
  \ automatically categorize each study based on these two inputs using the completely\
  \ scientifically legitimate \"bs-factor\". The bs-factor for a particular paper\
  \ is calculated as follows:\n\n * bs-factor when the authors satisfy all six requirements\
  \ is 1\n * bs-factor when the authors satisfy only five requirements is 2\n * bs-factor\
  \ when the authors satisfy only four requirements is 4\n * bs-factor when the authors\
  \ satisfy only three requirements is 8...\n\nYour function should multiply the p-value\
  \ by the bs-factor and use that product to return one of the following strings:\n\
  \n * product is less than 0.05: \"Fine\"\n * product is 0.05 to 0.15: \"Needs review\"\
  \n * product is 0.15 or higher: \"Pants on fire\"\n \nYou've also decided that all\
  \ studies meeting _none_ of the author requirements that would have been categorized\
  \ as \"Fine\" should instead be categorized as \"Needs review\".\n\nFor example:\n\
  \n`categorize_study(0.01, 3)` should return `\"Needs review\"` because the p-value\
  \ times the bs-factor is `0.08`.\n\n`categorize_study(0.04, 6)` should return `\"\
  Fine\"` because the p-value times the bs-factor is only `0.04`.\n\n`categorize_study(0.0001,\
  \ 0)` should return `\"Needs review\"` even though the p-value times the bs-factor\
  \ is only `0.0064`.\n\n`categorize_study(0.012, 0)` should return `\"Pants on fire\"\
  ` because the p-value times the bs-factor is `0.768`."
