"vc-description": "When you divide the successive powers of `10` by `13` you get the\
  \ following remainders of the integer divisions:  \n\n`1, 10, 9, 12, 3, 4`. \n\n\
  Then the whole pattern repeats.\n\nHence the following method:\nMultiply the right\
  \ most digit of the number with the left most number \nin the sequence shown above,\
  \ the second right most digit to the second \nleft most digit of the number in the\
  \ sequence. The cycle goes on and you sum all these products. Repeat this process\
  \ until the sequence of sums is stationary.\n\n...........................................................................\n\
  \nExample: What is the remainder when `1234567` is divided by `13`?\n\n`7×1 + 6×10\
  \ + 5×9 + 4×12 + 3×3 + 2×4 + 1×1 = 178`\n\nWe repeat the process with 178:\n\n`8x1\
  \ + 7x10 + 1x9 = 87`\n\nand again with 87:\n\n`7x1 + 8x10 = 87`\n\n...........................................................................\n\
  \nFrom now on the sequence is stationary and the remainder of `1234567` by `13`\
  \ is \nthe same as the remainder of `87` by `13`: `9`\n\nCall `thirt` the function\
  \ which processes this sequence of operations on an integer `n (>=0)`. `thirt` will\
  \ return the stationary number.\n\n`thirt(1234567)` calculates 178, then 87, then\
  \ 87 and returns `87`.\n\n`thirt(321)` calculates 48, 48 and returns `48`"
