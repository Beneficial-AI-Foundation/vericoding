"vc-description": "The date is March 24, 2437 and the the Earth has been nearly completely\
  \ destroyed by the actions of its inhabitants. Our last hope in this disaster lies\
  \ in a shabby time machine built from old toasters and used microwave parts.  \n\
  \nThe World Time Agency requires you to travel back in time to prevent disaster.\
  \  You are ordered to \"remove\" certain babies from the timeline.  \n\nHistorical\
  \ newspapers and records provide the Date, Month, and Year for each mission.  Unfortunately\
  \ the time machine takes input only as the number of days to travel back in time.\
  \  It is your job to calculate how many days you will need to travel back from today's\
  \ date (March 24, 2437) for each mission.\n\nFor example, if a historical newspaper\
  \ says a dangerous baby was born on:\nDate = 21, Month = 3, Year = 2437\nThen your\
  \ function must compute that it was 3 Days ago.\n\nAnother example would be that\
  \ a baby born on Date = 24, Month = 3, Year = 2436 would have been born 365 days\
  \ ago.\n\nYou will not have time travel past the year 0.\n\nNote that while this\
  \ is a fairly simple task, it is complicated by the fact that newspapers used the\
  \ Julian calendar instead of the current Gregorian calendar prior to September 14,\
  \ 1752.  In 1752, it was declared that Sep 2, 1752 was proceeded immediately by\
  \ September 14, 1752, entirely omitting September 3-13. Furthermore, the rules for\
  \ leap years changed on that date.\n\nAfter 1752, leap years are on any year divisible\
  \ by four, except for years which are divisible by 100. An exception to that exception\
  \ is that years divisible by 400 are always leap years.  For example, 1803, 1900,\
  \ 2001, 2019, and 2100 are not leap years, but 1804, 2000 and 2020 are leap years.\
  \ \nHowever in the Julian calander prior to and including 1752, leap years were\
  \ on every year divisible by 4, without the exception of years divisible by 100.\
  \  The years 1752, 1700, 1600, and 0 were all leap years.\n\nGood luck agent, the\
  \ world depends on you!\n\n\nNote: It is not required, but if you find it helpful\
  \ to visualize the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, please see\
  \ these links:\n\nPlease observe that much of September 1752 is missing here: https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?year=1752&country=1\n\
  \nPlease observe that 1700 is a leap year here: https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?year=1700&country=1"
