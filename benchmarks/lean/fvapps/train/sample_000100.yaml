"vc-description": "Polycarp lives on the coordinate axis $Ox$ and travels from the\
  \ point $x=a$ to $x=b$. It moves uniformly rectilinearly at a speed of one unit\
  \ of distance per minute.\n\nOn the axis $Ox$ at the point $x=c$ the base station\
  \ of the mobile operator is placed. It is known that the radius of its coverage\
  \ is $r$. Thus, if Polycarp is at a distance less than or equal to $r$ from the\
  \ point $x=c$, then he is in the network coverage area, otherwise — no. The base\
  \ station can be located both on the route of Polycarp and outside it.\n\nPrint\
  \ the time in minutes during which Polycarp will not be in the coverage area of\
  \ the network, with a rectilinear uniform movement from $x=a$ to $x=b$. His speed —\
  \ one unit of distance per minute.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains\
  \ a positive integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) — the number of test cases. In the\
  \ following lines are written $t$ test cases.\n\nThe description of each test case\
  \ is one line, which contains four integers $a$, $b$, $c$ and $r$ ($-10^8 \\le a,b,c\
  \ \\le 10^8$, $0 \\le r \\le 10^8$) — the coordinates of the starting and ending\
  \ points of the path, the base station, and its coverage radius, respectively.\n\
  \nAny of the numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ can be equal (either any pair or all three\
  \ numbers). The base station can be located both on the route of Polycarp and outside\
  \ it.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $t$ numbers — answers to given test cases in\
  \ the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer — the number\
  \ of minutes during which Polycarp will be unavailable during his movement.\n\n\n\

  \  [Image] Polycarp goes from $1$ to $10$. The yellow area shows the coverage area\
  \ of the station with a radius of coverage of $1$, which is located at the point\
  \ of $7$. The green area shows a part of the path when Polycarp is out of coverage\
  \ area."
