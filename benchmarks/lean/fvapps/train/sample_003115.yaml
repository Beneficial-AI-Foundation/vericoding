"vc-description": "Jenny is 9 years old. She is the youngest detective in North America.\
  \ Jenny is a 3rd grader student, so when a new mission comes up, she gets a code\
  \ to decipher in a form of a sticker (with numbers) in her math notebook and a comment\
  \ (a sentence) in her writing notebook. All she needs to do is to figure out one\
  \ word, from there she already knows what to do. \nAnd here comes your role - you\
  \ can help Jenny find out what the word is! \n\nIn order to find out what the word\
  \ is, you should use the sticker (array of 3 numbers) to retrive 3 letters from\
  \ the comment (string) that create the word.\n\n- Each of the numbers in the array\
  \ refers to the position of a letter in the string, in increasing order.\n- Spaces\
  \ are not places, you need the actual letters. No spaces.\n- The returned word should\
  \ be all lowercase letters.\n- if you can't find one of the letters using the index\
  \ numbers, return \"No mission today\". Jenny would be very sad, but that's life...\
  \ :( \n\nExample:\ninput: [5, 0, 3], \"I Love You\"\noutput: \"ivy\"\n(0 = \"i\"\
  , 3 = \"v\", 5 = \"y\")"
