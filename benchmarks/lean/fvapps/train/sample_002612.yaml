"vc-description": "The Tower of Hanoi problem involves 3 towers.  A number of rings\
  \ decreasing in size are placed on one tower.  All rings must then be moved to another\
  \ tower, but at no point can a larger ring be placed on a smaller ring.\n\nYour\
  \ task:  Given a number of rings, return the MINIMUM number of moves needed to move\
  \ all the rings from one tower to another.\n\nReference: Tower of Hanoi, Courtesy\
  \ of Coolmath Games\n\nNB:  This problem may seem very complex, but in reality there\
  \ is an amazingly simple formula to calculate the minimum number.  Just Learn how\
  \ to solve the problem via the above link (if you are not familiar with it), and\
  \ then think hard.  Your solution should be in no way extraordinarily long and complex.\
  \  The Kata ranking is for figuring out the solution, but the coding skills required\
  \ are minimal."
