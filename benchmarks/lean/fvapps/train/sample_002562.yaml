"vc-description": "# Task\n Yesterday you found some shoes in your room. Each shoe\
  \ is described by two values:\n```\ntype indicates if it's a left or a right shoe;\n\
  size is the size of the shoe.\n```\n Your task is to check whether it is possible\
  \ to pair the shoes you found in such a way that each pair consists of a right and\
  \ a left shoe of an equal size.\n\n# Example\n\n For:\n```\nshoes = [[0, 21], \n\
  \         [1, 23], \n         [1, 21], \n         [0, 23]]\n         ```\nthe output\
  \ should be `true;`\n\n For:\n```\nshoes = [[0, 21], \n         [1, 23], \n    \
  \     [1, 21], \n         [1, 23]]\n         ```\nthe output should be `false.`\n\
  \n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` 2D integer array `shoes`\n\n Array of shoes. Each\
  \ shoe is given in the format [type, size], where type is either 0 or 1 for left\
  \ and right respectively, and size is a positive integer.\n\n Constraints: `2 ≤\
  \ shoes.length ≤ 50,  1 ≤ shoes[i][1] ≤ 100.`\n\n - `[output]` a boolean value\n\
  \n   `true` if it is possible to pair the shoes, `false` otherwise."
