"vc-description": "Adapted from here, with less terrible instructions and a couple\
  \ tweaks.\n\nTwo kangaroos are jumping on a line. They start out at different points\
  \ on the line, and jump in the same direction at different speeds. Your task is\
  \ to determine whether or not they'll ever land in the same spot at the same time\
  \ (you'll just have to suspend disbelief for a moment and accept that two kangaroos,\
  \ for the purpose of this kata, can occupy the same space at the same time :)\n\n\
  Your function is given four arguments `(kanga1, rate1, kanga2, rate2)`; the first\
  \ kangaroo's starting point, the first kangaroo's speed, the second kangaroo's starting\
  \ point, and the second kangaroo's speed.\n\nReturn `true` if the above conditions\
  \ are met, else `false`. Starting location and speed may vary wildly. The first\
  \ kangaroo will _usually_ start behind the second one and travel faster, but not\
  \ always. Starting locations may be negative, but speeds will always be > 0.\n\n\
  **Example:**\n![kangaroo](https://i.imgur.com/hXRgSVg.jpg)\n\n**Other examples:**\n\
  \nBrute force solutions are possible (and not discouraged), but you'll save yourself\
  \ a lot of waiting time if you don't go that route :)\n\nGood luck!"
