"vc-description": "In this Kata you are a game developer and have programmed the #1\
  \ MMORPG(Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) worldwide!!! Many suggestions\
  \ came across you to make the game better, one of which you are interested in and\
  \ will start working on at once.\n\nPlayers in the game have levels from 1 to 170,\
  \ XP(short for experience) is required to increase the player's level and is obtained\
  \ by doing all sorts of things in the game, a new player starts at level 1 with\
  \ 0 XP. You want to add a feature that would enable the player to input a target\
  \ level and the output would be how much XP the player must obtain in order for\
  \ him/her to reach the target level...simple huh.\n\nCreate a function called ```xp_to_target_lvl```\
  \ that takes 2 arguments(```current_xp``` and ```target_lvl```, both as integer)\
  \ and returns the remaining XP for the player to reach the ```target_lvl``` formatted\
  \ as a rounded down integer.\n\nLeveling up from level 1 to level 2 requires 314\
  \ XP, at first each level up requires 25% XP more than the previous level up, every\
  \ 10 levels the percentage increase reduces by 1. See the examples for a better\
  \ understanding.\n\nKeep in mind that when players reach level 170 they stop leveling\
  \ up but they continue gaining experience.\n\nIf one or both of the arguments are\
  \ invalid(not given,  not in correct format, not in range...etc) return \"Input\
  \ is invalid.\".\n\nIf the player has already reached the ```target_lvl``` return\
  \ ```\"You have already reached level target_lvl.\"```.\n\nExamples:\n```\nxp_to_target_lvl(0,5)\
  \ => XP from lvl1 to lvl2 = 314\n                         XP from lvl2 to lvl3 =\
  \ 314 + (314*0.25) = 392\n                         XP from lvl3 to lvl4 = 392 +\
  \ (392*0.25) = 490\n                         XP from lvl4 to lvl5 = 490 + (490*0.25)\
  \ = 612\n                         XP from lvl1 to target_lvl = 314 + 392 + 490 +\
  \ 612 = 1808\n                         XP from current_xp to target_lvl = 1808 -\
  \ 0 = 1808\n\nxp_to_target_lvl(12345,17) => XP from lvl1 to lvl2 = 314         \
  \          \n                               XP from lvl2 to lvl3 = 314 + (314*0.25)\
  \ = 392\n                               XP from lvl3 to lvl4 = 392 + (392*0.25)\
  \ = 490\n                               ...\n                               XP from\
  \ lvl9 to lvl10 = 1493 + (1493*0.25) = 1866 \n                               XP\
  \ from lvl10 to lvl11 = 1866 + (1866*0.24) = 2313 << percentage increase is \n \
  \                              ...                                             \
  \      reduced by 1 (25 - 1 = 24)\n                               XP from lvl16\
  \ to lvl17 = 6779 + (6779*0.24) = 8405\n                               XP from lvl1\
  \ to target_lvl = 314 + 392 + 490 + 612 + ... + 8405 = 41880\n                 \
  \              XP from current_xp to target_lvl = 41880 - 12345 = 29535\n\nxp_to_target_lvl()\
  \ => \"Input is invalid.\"             }\nxp_to_target_lvl(-31428.7,'47') => \"\
  Input is invalid.\" }> Invalid input\nxp_to_target_lvl(83749,0) => \"Input is invalid.\"\
  \   }\n\nxp_to_target_lvl(2017,4) => \"You have already reached level 4.\"\nxp_to_target_lvl(0,1)\
  \ => 'You have already reached level 1.'\n```\n\nMake sure you round down the XP\
  \ required for each level up, rounding up will result in the output being slightly\
  \ wrong."
