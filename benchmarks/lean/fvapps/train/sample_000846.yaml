"vc-description": "We say that a binary string (a string containing only characters\
  \ '0' and '1') is pure if it does not contain either of the strings \"0101\" or\
  \ \"1010\" as a subsequence.\nRecall that string T is a subsequence of string S\
  \ if we can delete some of the letters of S (possibly none) such that the resulting\
  \ string will become T.\nYou are given a binary string $S$ with length $N$. We want\
  \ to make this string pure by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from it.\
  \ What is the minimum number of characters we have to delete?\n\n-----Input-----\n\
  - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number\
  \ of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only\
  \ line of each test case contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.\n\n-----Output-----\n\
  For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number\
  \ of characters we have to delete from $S$.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le\
  \ T \\le 40$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 1,000$\n- $S$ contains only characters '0' and '1'\n\
  \n-----Example Input-----\n4\n010111101\n1011100001011101\n0110\n111111\n\n-----Example\
  \ Output-----\n2\n3\n0\n0\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: We can delete\
  \ the first and third character of our string. There is no way to make the string\
  \ pure by deleting only one character.\nExample case 3: The given string is already\
  \ pure, so the answer is zero."
