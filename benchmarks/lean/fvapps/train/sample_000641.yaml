"vc-description": "The chef was busy in solving algebra, he found some interesting\
  \ results, that there are many numbers which can be formed by the sum of the factorial\
  \ of the digits, he wrote all those interesting numbers in the diary(in increasing\
  \ order) and went to sleep. Cheffina came and stole his diary, in morning chef found\
  \ that his diary is missing. Now the chef wants your help to find those numbers,\
  \ Chef asks you whether N is that interesting number or not. If N is an interesting\
  \ number then print 1. Else print 0. \n\n-----Input:-----\n- First-line will contain\
  \ $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \n- Each test case\
  \ contains a single line of input, $N$. \n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case,\
  \ output in a single line answer 1 or 0.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T\
  \ \\leq 10^6$\n- $0 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n2\n10\n\n\
  -----Sample Output:-----\n1\n0\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nFor 1) Factorial of 2\
  \ is 2, hence it is an interesting number.\nFor 2) conversion for 10 is 1! + 0!\
  \ = 2, which is not equal to 10, hence not an interesting number."
