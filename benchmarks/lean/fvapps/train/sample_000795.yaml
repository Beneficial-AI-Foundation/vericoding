"vc-description": "Johnny has some difficulty memorizing the small prime numbers.\
  \ So, his computer science teacher has asked him to play with the following puzzle\
  \ game frequently.\nThe puzzle is a 3x3 board consisting of numbers from 1 to 9.\
  \ The objective of the puzzle is to swap the tiles until the following final state\
  \ is reached:\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n\nAt each step, Johnny may swap two adjacent\
  \ tiles if their sum is a prime number. Two tiles are considered adjacent if they\
  \ have a common edge.\nHelp Johnny to find the shortest number of steps needed to\
  \ reach the goal state.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains t, the number\
  \ of test cases (about 50). Then t test cases follow. Each test case consists of\
  \ a 3x3 table describing a puzzle which Johnny would like to solve.\nThe input data\
  \ for successive test cases is separated by a blank line.\n\n-----Output-----\n\
  For each test case print a single line containing the shortest number of steps needed\
  \ to solve the corresponding puzzle. If there is no way to reach the final state,\
  \ print the number -1.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n\n7 3 2 \n4 1 5 \n6 8 9\
  \ \n\n9 8 5 \n2 4 1 \n3 7 6  \n\nOutput:\n6\n-1\n\n-----Output details-----\nThe\
  \ possible 6 steps in the first test case are described in the following figure:"
