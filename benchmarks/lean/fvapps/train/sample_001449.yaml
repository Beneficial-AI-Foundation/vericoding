"vc-description": "Santosh has a farm at Byteland. He has a very big family to look\
  \ after.  His life takes a sudden turn and he runs into a financial crisis. After\
  \ giving all the money he has in his hand, he decides to sell his plots. The speciality\
  \ of his land is that it is rectangular in nature. Santosh comes to know that he\
  \ will get more money if he sells square shaped plots. So keeping this in mind,\
  \ he decides to divide his land into minimum possible number of square plots, such\
  \ that each plot has the same area, and  the plots divide the land perfectly. He\
  \ does this in order to get the maximum profit out of this.   \nSo your task is\
  \ to find the minimum number of square plots with the same area, that can be formed\
  \ out of the rectangular land, such that they divide it perfectly.\n\n-----Input-----\n\
  - The first line of the input contains $T$, the number of test cases. Then $T$ lines\
  \ follow.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated\
  \ integers, $N$ and $M$, the length and the breadth of the land, respectively.\n\
  \n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print the minimum number of square plots\
  \ with equal area, such that they divide the farm land perfectly, in a new line.\n\
  \n-----Constraints-----\n$1 \\le T \\le 20$\n$1 \\le M \\le 10000$\n$1 \\le N \\\
