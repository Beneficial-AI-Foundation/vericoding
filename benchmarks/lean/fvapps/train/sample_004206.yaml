vc-description: |-
  For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. If the input is a string then "Zach" ate the cookie. If the input is a float or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. If the input is anything else "the dog" ate the cookie. The way to return the statement is:
  "Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!"

  Ex: Input = "hi" --> Output = "Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach!
  (The reason you return Zach is because the input is a string)

  Note: Make sure you return the correct message with correct spaces and punctuation.

  Please leave feedback for this kata.
  Cheers!
