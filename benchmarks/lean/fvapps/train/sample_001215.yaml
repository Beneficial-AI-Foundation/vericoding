"vc-description": "Chef Zidane likes the number 9. He has a number N, and he wants\
  \ to turn it into a multiple of 9. He cannot add or remove digits, and he can only\
  \ change one digit at a time. The only allowed operation is to increment or decrement\
  \ a digit by one, and doing this takes exactly one second. Note that he cannot increase\
  \ a digit 9 or decrease a digit 0, and the resulting number must not contain any\
  \ leading zeroes unless N has a single digit.\n\nChef Zidane wants to know the minimum\
  \ amount of time (in seconds) needed to accomplish this. Please help him, before\
  \ his kitchen gets overwhelmed with mist!\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of\
  \ the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description\
  \ of T test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of one line containing a single\
  \ positive integer N.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single line\
  \ containing the answer.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 ≤ T ≤ 105\n- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10105\n\
  - N will not contain leading zeroes.\n- Each test file is at most 3Mb in size.\n\
  \n-----Example-----\nInput:4\n1989\n86236\n90210\n99999999999999999999999999999999999999988\n\
  \nOutput:0\n2\n3\n2\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1. 1989 is already divisible\
  \ by 9, so no operations are needed to be performed.\nExample case 2. 86236 can\
  \ be turned into a multiple of 9 by incrementing the first and third digit (from\
  \ the left), to get 96336. This takes 2 seconds.\nExample case 3. 90210 can be turned\
  \ into a multiple of 9 by decrementing the third digit twice and the fourth digit\
  \ once, to get 90000. This takes 3 seconds."
