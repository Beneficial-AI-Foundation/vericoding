"vc-description": "Chef Hari has got a new obsession now: he has started playing chess\
  \ (read about it here) and he is liking this game very much. Since Hari has spent\
  \ several months playing chess with his friends, he has now decided to take part\
  \ in some chess tournament in Cheftown.\n\nThere are currently two tournaments going\
  \ on in Cheftown and each tournament has its own entry fee. Due to this economical\
  \ restriction and his budget, Hari can take part in only one tournament.\n\nThe\
  \ entry fee for first tournament is F1 units of money. The structure of tournament\
  \ is as follows: first there will be group matches and then there will be finals.\
  \ If Hari reaches in finals and wins it, he'll get R1 units of money. If after reaching\
  \ in finals, Hari loses, he'll get R2 units of money. If Hari fails to reach in\
  \ finals, he'll get nothing. The probability of reaching in finals of first tournament\
  \ for Hari is p1 and probability of winning in finals after reaching is p2.\n\n\
  The entry fee for second tournament is F2 units of money. The structure of tournament\
  \ is as follows: first there will be group matches and then there will be finals.\
  \ If Hari reaches in finals, he'll immediately get R3 units of money, otherwise\
  \ he'll get nothing. If after reaching in finals, Hari wins, he'll get R4 units\
  \ of money. The probability of reaching in finals of second tournament for Hari\
  \ is p3 and probability of winning in finals after reaching is p4.\n\nNow, Hari\
  \ wants to maximise his profit. He wants to know which tournament he should participate\
  \ in such that his expected profit is maximised. Help Hari in deciding this.\n\n\
  Note:\nIn the tournaments of Cheftown, the game never ends with a draw. So, either\
  \ Hari wins a game, or he loses.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of the input contains\
  \ T, the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as following:\n\
  \nFirst line of each test case contains 6 integers F1, F2, R1, R2, R3 and R4.\n\n\
  Next line of each test case contains 4 floating point numbers p1, p2, p3 and p4.\n\
  Each number has exactly 2 digits after decimal point.\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor\
  \ each test case, output a single line having \"FIRST\" if expected profit of first\
  \ tournament is maximum or \"SECOND\" if expected profit of second tournament is\
  \ maximum or \"BOTH\" if expected profits of both the tournaments is exactly same.\n\
  \n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100\n- 1 ≤ F1, F2, R1, R2, R3, R4 ≤ 100\n- 0.00\
  \ ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 1.00\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask#1: 30 points\n- p1 = p3\
  \ and p2 = p4\n\nSubtask#2: 70 points\n- All usual constraints.\n\n-----Example-----\n\
  Input:\n2\n30 50 70 10 40 30\n0.25 0.10 0.30 0.05\n50 36 80 38 65 32\n0.55 0.12\
  \ 0.33 0.54\n\nOutput:\nFIRST\nSECOND\n\n-----Explanation-----\n\nIn the first case,\
  \ the expected profit for first tournament is -26.00 and expected profit for second\
  \ tournament is -37.55. So, first tournament has better expected profit.\n\nIn the\
  \ second case, the expected profit for first tournament is -26.328 and expected\
  \ profit for second tournament is -8.8476. So, second tournament has better expected\
  \ profit."
