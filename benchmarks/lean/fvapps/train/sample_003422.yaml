  \n\nBalls!\n\nThose wayward Winchester boys are in trouble again, hunting something\
  \ down in New Orleans.\nYou are Bobby Singer, you know how \"idjits\" they can be,\
  \ so you have to prepare.\nThey will call you any minute with the race of the thing,\
  \ and you want to answer as soon as possible. By answer, I mean: tell them how to\
  \ kill, or fight it.\n\nYou have something like a database (more like drunken doodling)\
  \ to help them:\n\n- werewolf           : Silver knife or bullet to the heart\n\
  - vampire            : Behead it with a machete\n- wendigo            : Burn it\
  \ to death\n- shapeshifter       : Silver knife or bullet to the heart\n- angel\
  \              : Use the angelic blade\n- demon              : Use Ruby's knife,\
  \ or some Jesus-juice\n- ghost              : Salt and iron, and don't forget to\
  \ burn the corpse\n- dragon             : You have to find the excalibur for that\n\
  - djinn              : Stab it with silver knife dipped in a lamb's blood \n- pagan\
  \ god          : It depends on which one it is\n- leviathan          : Use some\
  \ Borax, then kill Dick\n- ghoul              : Behead it\n- jefferson starship\
  \ : Behead it with a silver blade\n- reaper             : If it's nasty, you should\
  \ gank who controls it\n- rugaru             : Burn it alive\n- skinwalker     \
  \    : A silver bullet will do it\n- phoenix            : Use the colt\n- witch\
  \              : They are humans\n- else               : I have friggin no idea\
  \ yet\n\nYou can access the database as `drunkenDoodling`/`drunken_doodling`/`DrunkenDoodling`\
  \ depending on your language.\n\n---\n\nSo a call would go down like this:\n\nThe\
  \ guys call you:\n```bob('rugaru')```\n\n...and you reply (return) with the info,\
  \ and your signature saying of yours!\n```Burn it alive, idjits!```"
