"vc-description": "Have you heard about the myth that [if you fold a paper enough\
  \ times, you can reach the moon with it](http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/31/paper-folding-to-the-moon/)?\
  \ Sure you have, but exactly how many? Maybe it's time to write a program to figure\
  \ it out.\n\nYou know that a piece of paper has a thickness of `0.0001m`. Given\
  \ `distance` in units of meters, calculate how many times you have to fold the paper\
  \ to make the paper reach this distance.  \n(If you're not familiar with the concept\
  \ of folding a paper: Each fold doubles its total thickness.)\n\nNote: Of course\
  \ you can't do half a fold. You should know what this means ;P\n\nAlso, if somebody\
  \ is giving you a negative distance, it's clearly bogus and you should yell at them\
  \ by returning `null` (or whatever equivalent in your language. In Shell please\
  \ return `None`)."
