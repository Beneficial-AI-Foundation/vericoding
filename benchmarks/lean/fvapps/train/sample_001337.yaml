"vc-description": "In India, every individual is charged with income tax on the total\
  \ income each year. This tax is applied to specific ranges of income, which are\
  \ called income tax slabs. The slabs of income tax keep changing from year to year.\
  \ This fiscal year (2020-21), the tax slabs and their respective tax rates are as\
  \ follows:Total income (in rupees)Tax rateup to Rs. 250,0000%from Rs. 250,001 to\
  \ Rs. 500,0005%from Rs. 500,001 to Rs. 750,00010%from Rs. 750,001 to Rs. 1,000,00015%from\
  \ Rs. 1,000,001 to Rs. 1,250,00020%from Rs. 1,250,001 to Rs. 1,500,00025%above Rs.\
  \ 1,500,00030%\nSee the sample explanation for details on how the income tax is\
  \ calculated.\nYou are given Chef's total income: $N$ rupees (Rs.). Find his net\
  \ income. The net income is calculated by subtracting the total tax (also called\
  \ tax reduction) from the total income. Note that you do not need to worry about\
  \ any other kind of tax reductions, only the one described above.\n\n-----Input-----\n\
  - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number\
  \ of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only\
  \ line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor\
  \ each test case, print a single line containing one integer — Chef's net income.\n\
  \n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10^3$\n- $0 \\le N \\le 10^7$\n- $N$ is\
  \ a multiple of $100$\n\n-----Example Input-----\n2\n600000\n250000\n\n-----Example\
  \ Output-----\n577500\n250000\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: We know\
  \ that the total income is Rs. $6$ lakh ($1$ lakh rupees = $10^5$ rupees). The total\
  \ tax for each slab is calculated as follows:\n- Up to $2.5$ lakh, the tax is Rs.\
  \ $0$, since the tax rate is $0$ percent.\n- From above Rs. $2.5$ lakh to Rs. $5$\
  \ lakh, the tax rate is $5$ percent. Therefore, this tax is $0.05 \\cdot (500,000-250,000)$,\
  \ which is Rs. $12,500$.\n- From above Rs. $5$ lakh to Rs. $6$ lakh, the tax rate\
  \ is $10$ percent. Therefore, this tax is $0.10 \\cdot (600,000-500,000)$, which\
  \ is Rs. $10,000$.\n- Summing them up, we get that the total tax on Chef's whole\
  \ income is Rs. $22,500$. Since the net income is the total income minus the tax\
  \ reduction, it is Rs. $600,000$ minus Rs. $22,500$, which is Rs. $577,500$.\nExample\
  \ case 2: For income up to Rs. $2.5$ lakh, we have no tax, so the net income is\
  \ the same as the total income: Rs. $2.5$ lakh."
