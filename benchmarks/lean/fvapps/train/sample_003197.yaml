"vc-description": "You have a collection of lovely poems. Unfortuantely they aren't\
  \ formatted very well. They're all on one line, like this:\n\n```\nBeautiful is\
  \ better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex.\
  \ Complex is better than complicated.\n```\nWhat you want is to present each sentence\
  \ on a new line, so that it looks like this:\n```\nBeautiful is better than ugly.\n\
  Explicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex.\nComplex is better\
  \ than complicated.\n```\nWrite a function, `format_poem()` that takes a string\
  \ like the one line example as an argument and returns a new string that is formatted\
  \ across multiple lines with each new sentence starting on a new line when you print\
  \ it out.\n\nTry to solve this challenge with the [str.split()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split)\
  \ and the [str.join()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join)\
  \ string methods.\n\nEvery sentence will end with a period, and every new sentence\
  \ will have one space before the previous period. Be careful about trailing whitespace\
  \ in your solution."
