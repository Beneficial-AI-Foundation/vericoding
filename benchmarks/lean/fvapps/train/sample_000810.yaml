"vc-description": "Vivek was quite bored with the lockdown, so he came up with an\
  \ interesting task. He successfully completed this task and now, he would like you\
  \ to solve it.\nYou are given two strings $A$ and $B$, each with length $N$. Let's\
  \ index the characters in each string from $0$ ― for each $i$ ($0 \\le i < N$),\
  \ the $i+1$-th characters of $A$ and $B$ are denoted by $A_i$ and $B_i$ respectively.\
  \ You should convert $A$ to $B$ by performing operations of the following type:\n\
  - Choose a subset $S$ of the set $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$.\n- Let $c$ be the alphabetically\
  \ smallest character among $A_x$ for all $x \\in S$.\n- For each $x \\in S$, replace\
  \ $A_x$ by $c$.\nYou should find the smallest necessary number of operations or\
  \ report that it is impossible to convert $A$ to $B$. If it is possible, you also\
  \ need to find one way to convert $A$ to $B$ using this smallest number of operations.\
  \ If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The\
  \ first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test\
  \ cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test\
  \ case contains a single integer $N$.\n- The second line contains a single string\
  \ $A$.\n- The third line contains a single string $B$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor\
  \ each test case:\n- If it is impossible to convert $A$ to $B$, print a single line\
  \ containing the integer $-1$.\n- Otherwise, first, print a line containing a single\
  \ integer $K$ ― the minimum number of operations.\n- Then, print $K$ lines describing\
  \ the operations. Each of these lines should contain a positive integer $Z$, followed\
  \ by a space and $Z$ pairwise distinct space-separated integers from the set $\\\
  {0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$ ― the elements of $S$.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\\
  le T \\le 20$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 10^3$\n- $|A| = |B| = N$\n- $A$ and $B$ contain\
  \ only lowercase English letters\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\
  \ $B$ contains only characters 'a' and 'b'\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\
  \n-----Example Input-----\n3\n5\nabcab\naabab\n3\naaa\naab\n2\nde\ncd\n\n-----Example\
  \ Output-----\n2\n3 1 2 4\n3 0 1 3\n-1\n-1\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case\
  \ 1:\n- First, we can choose $S = (1, 2, 4)$, so the character $c$ is 'b' and the\
  \ string $A$ after this operation is \"abbab\".\n- Then, we choose $S = (0, 1, 3)$,\
  \ so $c$ is 'a', and $A$ becomes \"aabab\".\n- There is no way to convert $A$ to\
  \ $B$ in only one operation.\nExample case 2: We can see that it is impossible to\
  \ convert $A$ to $B$ since $c$ is always 'a'.\nExample case 3: We can see again\
  \ that it is impossible to convert $A$ to $B$ since $c$ cannot be 'c'."
