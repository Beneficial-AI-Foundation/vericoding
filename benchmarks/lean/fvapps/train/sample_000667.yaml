"vc-description": "Chef has been working in a restaurant which has  N  floors. He\
  \ wants to minimize the time it takes him to go from the N-th floor to ground floor.\
  \ He can either take the elevator or the stairs. \nThe stairs are at an angle of\
  \ 45 degrees and Chef's velocity is V1 m/s when taking the stairs down. The elevator\
  \ on the other hand moves with a velocity V2 m/s. Whenever an elevator is called,\
  \ it always starts from ground floor and goes to N-th floor where it collects Chef\
  \ (collecting takes no time), it then makes its way down to the ground floor with\
  \ Chef in it.  \n\nThe elevator cross a total distance equal to N meters when going\
  \ from N-th floor to ground floor or vice versa, while the length of the stairs\
  \ is sqrt(2) * N because the stairs is at angle 45 degrees.\n\nChef has enlisted\
  \ your help to decide whether he should use stairs or the elevator to minimize his\
  \ travel time. Can you help him out?\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains\
  \ a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a\
  \ single line containing three space-separated integers N, V1, V2. \n\n-----Output-----\n\
  For each test case, output a single line with string Elevator or Stairs, denoting\
  \ the answer to the problem.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 ≤ T ≤  1000 \n- 1 ≤ N,\
  \ V1, V2 ≤  100 \n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n3\n5 10 15\n2 10 14\n7 14 10\n\n\
  Output:\nElevator\nStairs\nStairs"
