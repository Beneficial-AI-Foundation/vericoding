"vc-description": "# Task\nSome children are playing rope skipping game. Children\
  \ skip the rope at roughly the same speed: `once per second`. If the child fails\
  \ during the jump, he needs to tidy up the rope and continue. This will take `3\
  \ seconds`.\n\nYou are given an array `failedCount`, where each element is the jump\
  \ count at the failed. ie. `[12,23,45]` means the child failed 3 times in the game\
  \ process. The 1st mistake occurred when he jumped 12 times; The 2nd mistake occurred\
  \ when he jumped 23 times; The 3rd mistake occurred when he jumped 45 times.\n\n\
  Your task is to calculate how many times the child jumped in 60 seconds.\n\nNote:\
  \ Each child persisted at least 60 jumps, which meant it could have been over 60\
  \ seconds, but the child continued to skip rope.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n`[input]`\
  \ integer array `failedCount`\n\n`0 ≤ failedCount.length ≤ 60`\n\n`1 ≤ failedCount[i]\
  \ ≤ 60`\n\n`[output]` an integer\n\nhow many times the child jumped in 60 seconds.\n\
  \n\n# Example\n\nFor `failedCount = []`, the output should be `60`.\n\nThere is\
  \ no mistake in the game process. So the child jumped 60 times in 60 seconds.\n\n\
  For `failedCount = [12, 23, 45]`, the output should be `51`.\n```\nThe 1st mistake\
  \ occurred when he jumped 12 times. --> 12 seconds past.\nTidy up the rope and continue.\
  \                    --> 15 seconds past.\nThe 2nd mistake occurred when he jumped\
  \ 23 times. --> 26 seconds past.\nTidy up the rope and continue.               \
  \     --> 29 seconds past.\nThe 3rd mistake occurred when he jumped 45 times. -->\
  \ 51 seconds past.\nTidy up the rope and continue.                    --> 54 seconds\
  \ past.\nWhen he jumped 51 times                           --> 60 seconds past.\n\
