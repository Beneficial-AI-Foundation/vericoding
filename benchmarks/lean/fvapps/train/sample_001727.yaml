"vc-description": "Given a 2D array and a number of generations, compute n timesteps\
  \ of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).\n\
  \nThe rules of the game are:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours\
  \ dies, as if caused by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with more than three\
  \ live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.\n3. Any live cell with two or three\
  \ live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly\
  \ three live neighbours becomes a live cell.\n\nEach cell's neighborhood is the\
  \ 8 cells immediately around it (i.e. [Moore Neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood)).\
  \ The universe is infinite in both the x and y dimensions and all cells are initially\
  \ dead - except for those specified in the arguments. The return value should be\
  \ a 2d array cropped around all of the living cells. (If there are no living cells,\
  \ then return `[[]]`.)\n\nFor illustration purposes, 0 and 1 will be represented\
  \ as `░░` and `▓▓` blocks respectively (PHP, **C**: plain black and white squares).\
  \ You can take advantage of the `htmlize` function to get a text representation\
  \ of the universe, e.g.:\n\n```python\nprint(htmlize(cells))\n````\n\n~~~if:c\n\
  In **C**, the initial dimensions of the GoL universe is passed into your function\
  \ *by reference* via the pointers `rowptr` and `colptr`.  When expanding/contracting\
  \ the GoL universe, please keep track of the dimensions of the modified grid through\
  \ these two variables.\n~~~"
