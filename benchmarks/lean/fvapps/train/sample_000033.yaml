"vc-description": "Numbers $1, 2, 3, \\dots n$ (each integer from $1$ to $n$ once)\
  \ are written on a board. In one operation you can erase any two numbers $a$ and\
  \ $b$ from the board and write one integer $\\frac{a + b}{2}$ rounded up instead.\n\
  \nYou should perform the given operation $n - 1$ times and make the resulting number\
  \ that will be left on the board as small as possible. \n\nFor example, if $n =\
  \ 4$, the following course of action is optimal:  choose $a = 4$ and $b = 2$, so\
  \ the new number is $3$, and the whiteboard contains $[1, 3, 3]$;  choose $a = 3$\
  \ and $b = 3$, so the new number is $3$, and the whiteboard contains $[1, 3]$; \
  \ choose $a = 1$ and $b = 3$, so the new number is $2$, and the whiteboard contains\
  \ $[2]$. \n\nIt's easy to see that after $n - 1$ operations, there will be left\
  \ only one number. Your goal is to minimize it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first\
  \ line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) — the number of test cases.\n\
  \nThe only line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\\
  cdot 10^5$) — the number of integers written on the board initially.\n\nIt's guaranteed\
  \ that the total sum of $n$ over test cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n\
  -----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, in the first line, print the minimum possible\
  \ number left on the board after $n - 1$ operations. Each of the next $n - 1$ lines\
  \ should contain two integers — numbers $a$ and $b$ chosen and erased in each operation.\n\
