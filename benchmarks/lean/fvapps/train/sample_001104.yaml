"vc-description": "This is one more story about our old friend, the Despotic King.\
  \ Once every year, it was customary for the king to give audience to the rich merchants\
  \ of his country in a large hall. On that day, the merchants were ushered in to\
  \ meet the king one by one and after paying their respects to the king they were\
  \ seated in the auditorium.\nIt was the job of the minister to introduce each merchant,\
  \ as he arrived, to the others in the hall. He would announce his name and his wealth.\
  \ However, our quirky king demanded that in addition, he should also announce the\
  \ rank of the merchant among all those in the hall (at the time of his arrival)\
  \ in terms of his wealth.\nFor example, let us suppose that the wealth of the 6\
  \ merchants who met the king (in the order in which they arrived) is given by the\
  \ sequence\n78246840398978246840398978 \\quad 24 \\quad 68 \\quad 40 \\quad 39 \\\
  quad 89\nThen, clearly the first merchant is the richest in the hall when he enters\
  \ it (since there are no others in the hall) and so his rank is $1$. Since $24 <\
  \ 78$ the rank of the second merchant when he enters the hall is $2$. The rank of\
  \ the third merchant is also $2$ since $24 < 68 < 78$. The rank of the fourth merchant\
  \ is $3$ since $24 < 40 < 68 < 78$, the rank of the fifth merchant is $4$ since\
  \ $24 < 39 < 40 < 68 < 78$ and finally the rank of the sixth merchant is $1$ since\
  \ $24 < 39 < 40 < 68 < 78 < 89$. The sequence of ranks announced by the minister\
  \ would thus be:\n1223411223411 \\quad 2 \\quad 2 \\quad 3 \\quad 4 \\quad 1\nYour\
  \ task is to write a program that takes as input a sequence of distinct positive\
  \ integers indicating the wealth of the merchants in the order in which they visit\
  \ the king and outputs the sequence of ranks announced by the minister.\n\n-----Input:-----\n\
  The first line contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of merchants.\
  \ The next $N$ lines (line $2,...,N+1$) describe the wealth of these $N$ merchants.\
  \ Line $i+1$ contains a single positive integer indicating the wealth of the $i^{th}$\
  \ merchant to enter the hall.\n\n-----Output:-----\nYour output should consist of\
  \ $N$ lines. Line $i$ should be the rank announced when the $i^{th}$ minister enters\
  \ the hall.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 45000$.\n- No two merchants\
  \ have the same wealth.\n- You may also assume that in $30 \\%$ of of the inputs\
  \ $1 \\leq N \\leq 8000$.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n6\n78\n24\n68\n40\n39\n89\n\
  \n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n2\n2\n3\n4\n1"
