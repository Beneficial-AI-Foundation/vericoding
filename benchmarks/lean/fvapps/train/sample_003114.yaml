"vc-description": "*It seemed a good idea at the time...*\n\n# Why I did it?\n\nAfter\
  \ a year on **Codewars** I really needed a holiday...\n\nBut not wanting to drift\
  \ backwards in the honour rankings while I was away, I hatched a cunning plan!\n\
  \n# The Cunning Plan\n\nSo I borrowed my friend's \"Clone Machine\" and cloned myself\
  \ :-)\n\nNow my clone can do my Kata solutions for me and I can relax!\n\nBrilliant!!\n\
  \n\n\nFurthermore, at the end of the day my clone can re-clone herself...\n\nDouble\
  \ brilliant!!\n\n\n\nI wonder why I didn't think to do this earlier?\n\n\n\nSo as\
  \ I left for the airport I gave my clone instructions to:\n\n* do my Kata solutions\
  \ for me\n* feed the cat\n* try to keep the house tidy and not eat too much\n* sleep\n\
  * clone yourself\n* repeat same next day\n\n# The Flaw\n\nWell, how was I supposed\
  \ to know that cloned DNA is faulty?\n\n:-(\n\nEvery time they sleep they wake up\
  \ with decreased ability - they get slower... they get dumber... they are only able\
  \ to solve 1 less Kata than they could the previous day.\n\nFor example, if they\
  \ can solve 10 Kata today, then tomorrow they can solve only 9 Kata, then 8, 7,\
  \ 6... Eventually they can't do much more than sit around all day playing video\
  \ games.\n\nAnd (unlike me), when the clone cannot solve any more Kata they are\
  \ no longer clever enough to operate the clone machine either!\n\n# The Return Home\n\
  \nI suspected something was wrong when I noticed my **Codewars** honour had stopped\
  \ rising.\n\nI made a hasty return home...\n\n...and found 100s of clones scattered\
  \ through the house. Mostly they sit harmlessly mumbling to themselves. The largest\
  \ group have made a kind of nest in my loungeroom where they sit catatonic in front\
  \ of the PlayStation.\n\nThe whole place needs fumigating.\n\nThe fridge and pantry\
  \ are empty.\n\nAnd I can't find the cat.\n\n# Kata Task\n\nWrite a method to predict\
  \ the final outcome where:\n\nInput:\n\n* `kata-per-day` is the number of Kata I\
  \ can solve per day\n\nOutput:\n\n* ```[number-of-clones, number-of-kata-solved-by-clones]```"
