"vc-description": "Given an integer array arr and an integer difference, return the\
  \ length of the longest subsequence in arr which is an arithmetic sequence such\
  \ that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals difference.\n\
   \nExample 1:\nInput: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The\
  \ longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].\nExample 2:\nInput: arr = [1,3,5,7],\
  \ difference = 1\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is\
  \ any single element.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference\
  \ = -2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].\n\
  \n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr.length <= 10^5\n-10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4"
