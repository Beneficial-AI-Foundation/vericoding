"vc-description": "Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer)\
  \ of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.\n\nAccording\
  \ to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: \"A scientist has index h if h of his/her\
  \ N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more\
  \ than h citations each.\"\n\nExample:\n\n\nInput: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]\nOutput:\
  \ 3 \nExplanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each\
  \ of them had \n             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. \n \
  \            Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and\
  \ the remaining \n             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index\
  \ is 3.\n\nNote: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is\
  \ taken as the h-index."
