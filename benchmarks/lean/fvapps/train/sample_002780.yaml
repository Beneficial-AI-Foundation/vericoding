"vc-description": "Just another day in the world of Minecraft, Steve is working on\
  \ his new project -- building a beacon pyramid in front of his house.\n\n![Beacon\
  \ pyramid](http://www.minecraft101.net/reference/images/beacon_pyramid_thb.jpg)\n\
  \nSteve has already obtained the beacon (the glass wrapped blue thingy on the top),\
  \ he just needs to build the pyramid. Each level of the pyramid is built using one\
  \ of the following four kinds of block: gold, diamond, emerald, and iron. Since\
  \ these four kinds of blocks are relatively hard to collect, Steve needs to know\
  \ exactly how many of each kind is required to build a pyramid of level N.\n\nAssume\
  \ that the top level of the pyramid uses gold blocks, the second level uses diamond\
  \ blocks, the third level uses emerald blocks, the fourth level uses iron blocks,\
  \ and the fifth level uses gold blocks, etc. (if you are a Minecraft player, you\
  \ know it's not neccessary the right way to build the pyramid. Let's just assume\
  \ it is for the sake of this kata ;-))\n\nImplement a function that takes one argument\
  \ which is the number of levels of the pyramid, and returns an object of the form:\
  \ `{total: 9, gold: 9, diamond: 0, emerald: 0, iron: 0}`.\n\n---\n\nTo all the Minecraft\
  \ players out there: \nfeel free to expand this series or let me know if you have\
  \ any ideas related to Minecraft that can be turned into codewars puzzles. Some\
  \ ideas I have that might potentially be turned into katas:\n\n* distance traveled\
  \ in real world vs. in Nether\n* shortest path problems related to mining diamonds/gold/goodies\
  \ that appears in different levels under ground\n* growth of animal population from\
  \ breeding\n* redstone stuff?!\n\nIf you do end up expanding this series, please\
  \ send me a link of your kata so I can check it out and include a link to your kata\
  \ here :-)\n\n* [Minecraft Series #2: Minimum amount of fuel needed to get some\
