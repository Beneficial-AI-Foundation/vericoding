"vc-description": "I need to save some money to buy a gift. I think I can do something\
  \ like that:\n\nFirst week (W0) I save nothing on Sunday, 1 on Monday, 2 on Tuesday...\
  \ 6 on Saturday,\nsecond week (W1) 2 on Monday... 7 on Saturday and so on according\
  \ to the table below where the days are numbered from 0 to 6.\n\nCan you tell me\
  \ how much I will have for my gift on Saturday evening after I have saved 12? (Your\
  \ function finance(6) should return 168 which is the sum of the savings in the table).\
  \ \n\nImagine now that we live on planet XY140Z-n where the days of the week are\
  \ numbered from 0 to n (integer n > 0) and where\nI save from week number 0 to week\
