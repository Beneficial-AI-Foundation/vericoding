"vc-description": "A city of dimension N x N is constructed with grid of lanes. These\
  \ lanes are fenced by government so that no one can cross any grid diagonally. Although\
  \ a train \nline runs diagonally from (0,0) to (N,N).\nOur chef has a weird kind\
  \ of phobia and is very afraid to cross the railway line. He is at point (0,0) and\
  \ wants to get to the point (N,N). Calculate number of path \nthrough which it is\
  \ possible to reach to its destination travelling the minimum distance. .\nNote\
  \ that: \n\n1. Since he is already at position (0,0) he can go to either part of\
  \ grid (i.e. left or right part - divided by diagonal) but he will remain in that\
  \ part for the whole path.\n2. He is only afraid to \"cross\" the line, i.e. during\
  \ the route he can go to position (m,m) where 0\n3. You have to calculate the number\
  \ of path possible. If there is more than one path then you have to print the number\
  \ of path of minimum distances. \n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input\
  \ contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases, for each test case enter\
  \ the grid size i.e value of N.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output\
  \ a single line with number of such paths possible.\n(Note : If no such path possible\
  \ print 0)\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 <= T <= 100\n- 0 <= N <= 30\n\n-----Example-----\n\
