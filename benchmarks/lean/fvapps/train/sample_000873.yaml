"vc-description": "Note : This question carries $150$ $points$\nThere is an outcry\
  \ in Middle Earth, as the greatest war between Orgs of Dark Lord Sauron and Frodo\
  \ Baggins is about to begin. To end the war, Frodo decides to destroy the ring in\
  \ the volcano of Mordor. There are many ships that lead Frodo to Mordor, and he\
  \ is confused about which one he should board.  Given two-ship numbers $M$ and $N$,\
  \ Frodo has to solve a problem to find the ship which he should board.\nFind the\
  \ number of pairs (x, y), such that $1<=x<=M$ and $1<=y<=N$, for which $x*y + x+\
  \ y = string(x)+string(y)$ is true. \nAlso, calculate the number of distinct x satisfying\
  \ the given condition.  The number of pairs and the number of distinct x will help\
  \ select Frodo the boat he should board. Help Frodo defeat Sauron. \n\n-----Input\
  \ :-----\n- First line contains $T$ as number of test cases \n- Each test case contains\
  \ two integers $M$ and $N$ \n\n-----Output :-----\n- For each test case, print two\
  \ integers - the number of such pairs (x,y) and the number of distinct x\n\n-----Constraints\
  \ :-----\n- 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000\n- 1 ≤  M, N ≤ 10^9\n\n-----Sample Input :-----\n1\n1 9\n\
  \n-----Sample Output :-----\n1 1\n\n-----Explanation :-----\nFor test case two M=1\
  \ and N=9  Pair (1,9) satisfies the above condition 1*9+1+9= “19” and only x=1 satisfies\
  \ the equation."
