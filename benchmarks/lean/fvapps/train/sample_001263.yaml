"vc-description": "As we all know, F.C. Barcelona is the best soccer team of our era!\
  \ Their entangling and mesmerizing game style usually translates into very high\
  \ ball possession, consecutive counter-attack plays and goals. Lots of goals, thanks\
  \ to the natural talent of their attacker and best player in history, Lionel Andres\
  \ Messi.\nHowever, at the most prestigious tournament of individual teams, the UEFA\
  \ Champions League, there are no guarantees and believe it or not, Barcelona is\
  \ in trouble.... They are tied versus Chelsea, which is a very defending team that\
  \ usually relies on counter-strike to catch opposing teams off guard and we are\
  \ in the last minute of the match. So Messi decided to settle things down for good\
  \ and now he is conducting the ball on his teams' midfield and he will start a lethal\
  \ counter-attack :D\nAfter dribbling the 2 strikers from Chelsea, he now finds himself\
  \ near the center of the field and he won't be able to dribble the entire team on\
  \ his own, so he will need to pass the ball to one of his teammates, run forward\
  \ and receive the ball once again to score the final goal.\nExactly K players are\
  \ with him on his counter-attack and the coach, Tito Villanova knows that this counter-attack\
  \ will end in a goal only if after exactly N passes are performed between the players,\
  \ Messi ends up with the ball.\n(Note that the ball only needs to end with Messi\
  \ after exactly N passes are performed between all the K+1 players, i.e. Messi can\
  \ receive the ball several times during the N passes. See the 2nd test case explanation\
  \ for further clarification. ) \nHowever, he realized that there are many scenarios\
  \ possible for this, so he asked you, his assistant coach, to tell him in how many\
  \ ways can Messi score the important victory goal. So help him!!\n\n-----Input-----\n\
  Input will contain a number T denoting the number of test cases.\nThen T test cases\
  \ follow, each one consisting of two space-sparated integers N and K.\n\n-----Output-----\n\
  For each test case, output a single integer, the number of ways the winning play\
  \ might happen modulo 1000000007 (109+7).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n\n- 1 ≤ T ≤\
  \ 100\n- 2 ≤ N ≤ 1000\n- 1 ≤ K ≤ 10\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n2 4\n4 2\n\n\
  Output:\n4\n6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nIn the first test case, say four players\
  \ with Messi are Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta and Jordi Alba. Then the ways of the winning\
  \ play to happen when exactly  2 passes are to be performed are:\n1) Messi - Xavi\
  \ - Messi\n2) Messi - Busquets - Messi\n3) Messi - Iniesta - Messi\n4) Messi - Alba\
  \ - Messi\n\nIn the second test case, also say that two players with Messi are Xavi\
  \ and Iniesta. There are 6 ways for the winning play to happen when exactly 4 passes\
  \ are performed. All the examples of such winning play are:\n1) Messi - Xavi - Messi\
  \ - Iniesta - Messi\n2) Messi - Xavi - Iniesta - Xavi - Messi\n3) Messi - Xavi -\
  \ Messi - Xavi - Messi\n4) Messi - Iniesta - Messi - Iniesta - Messi\n5) Messi -\
  \ Iniesta - Messi - Xavi - Messi\n6) Messi - Iniesta - Xavi - Iniesta - Messi"
