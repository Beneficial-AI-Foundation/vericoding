"vc-description": "Error Handling is very important in coding and seems to be overlooked\
  \ or not implemented properly.\n\n#Task\n\nYour task is to implement a function\
  \ which takes a string as input and return an object containing the properties\n\
  vowels and consonants. The vowels property must contain the total count of vowels\
  \ {a,e,i,o,u}, and the total count of consonants {a,..,z} - {a,e,i,o,u}. Handle\
  \ invalid input and don't forget to return valid ones.\n\n#Input\n\nThe input is\
  \ any random string. You must then discern what are vowels and what are consonants\
  \ and sum for each category their total occurrences in an object. However you could\
  \ also receive inputs that are not strings. If this happens then you must return\
  \ an object with a vowels and consonants total of 0 because the input was NOT a\
  \ string. Refer to the Example section for a more visual representation of which\
  \ inputs you could receive and the outputs expected. :)\n\nExample:\n\n```python\n\
  Input: get_count('test')\nOutput: {vowels:1,consonants:3}\n\nInput: get_count('tEst')\n\
  Output: {vowels:1,consonants:3}\n\nInput get_count('    ')\nOutput: {vowels:0,consonants:0}\n\
  \nInput get_count()\nOutput: {vowels:0,consonants:0}\n```\n\nC#\n\nA Counter class\
  \ has been put in the preloaded section taking two parameters Vowels and Consonants\
  \ this must be the Object you return!"
