"vc-description": "Chef recently printed directions from his home to a hot new restaurant\
  \ across the town, but forgot to print the directions to get back home. Help Chef\
  \ to transform the directions to get home from the restaurant.\nA set of directions\
  \ consists of several instructions. The first instruction is of the form \"Begin\
  \ on XXX\", indicating the street that the route begins on. Each subsequent instruction\
  \ is of the form \"Left on XXX\" or \"Right on XXX\", indicating a turn onto the\
  \ specified road.\nWhen reversing directions, all left turns become right turns\
  \ and vice versa, and the order of roads and turns is reversed. See the sample input\
  \ for examples.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput will begin with an integer T, the number\
  \ of test cases that follow. Each test case begins with an integer N, the number\
  \ of instructions in the route. N lines follow, each with exactly one instruction\
  \ in the format described above.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print\
  \ the directions of the reversed route, one instruction per line. Print a blank\
  \ line after each test case.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 ≤ T ≤ 15\n- 2 ≤ N ≤ 40\n\
  - Each line in the input will contain at most 50 characters, will contain only alphanumeric\
  \ characters and spaces and will not contain consecutive spaces nor trailing spaces.\
  \ By alphanumeric characters we mean digits and letters of the English alphabet\
  \ (lowercase and uppercase).\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2\n4\nBegin on Road A\n\
  Right on Road B\nRight on Road C\nLeft on Road D\n6\nBegin on Old Madras Road\n\
  Left on Domlur Flyover\nLeft on 100 Feet Road\nRight on Sarjapur Road\nRight on\
  \ Hosur Road\nRight on Ganapathi Temple Road\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nBegin on\
  \ Road D\nRight on Road C\nLeft on Road B\nLeft on Road A\n\nBegin on Ganapathi\
  \ Temple Road\nLeft on Hosur Road\nLeft on Sarjapur Road\nLeft on 100 Feet Road\n\
  Right on Domlur Flyover\nRight on Old Madras Road\n\n-----Explanation-----\nIn the\
  \ first test case, the destination lies on Road D, hence the reversed route begins\
  \ on Road D. The final turn in the original route is turning left from Road C onto\
  \ Road D. The reverse of this, turning right from Road D onto Road C, is the first\
  \ turn in the reversed route."
