"vc-description": "Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game\
  \ \"21\".\nAlice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than\
  \ K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from\
  \ the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes\
  \ have equal probabilities.\nAlice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more\
  \ points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?\nExample 1:\n\
  Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10\nOutput: 1.00000\nExplanation:  Alice gets a single\
  \ card, then stops.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10\nOutput: 0.60000\n\
  Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.\nIn 6 out of W = 10 possibilities,\
  \ she is at or below N = 6 points.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10\n\
  Output: 0.73278\nNote:\n\n0 <= K <= N <= 10000\n1 <= W <= 10000\nAnswers will be\
  \ accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.\nThe judging\
  \ time limit has been reduced for this question."
