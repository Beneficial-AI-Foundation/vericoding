"vc-description": "Passer ratings are the generally accepted standard for evaluating\
  \ NFL quarterbacks.\nI knew a rating of 100 is pretty good, but never knew what\
  \ makes up the rating.\nSo out of curiosity I took a look at the wikipedia page\
  \ and had an idea or my first kata: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating\n\
  \n## Formula\n\nThere are four parts to the NFL formula:\n```python\nA = ((Completions\
  \ / Attempts) - .3) * 5\nB = ((Yards / Attempts) - 3) * .25\nC = (Touchdowns / Attempt)\
  \ * 20\nD = 2.375 - ((Interceptions / Attempts) * 25)\n```\nHowever, if the result\
  \ of any calculation is greater than `2.375`, it is set to `2.375`. If the result\
  \ is a negative number, it is set to zero.\n\nFinally the passer rating is: `((A\
  \ + B + C + D) / 6) * 100`\n\nReturn the rating rounded to the nearest tenth.\n\n\
  ## Example\n\nLast year Tom Brady had 432 attempts, 3554 yards, 291 completions,\
  \ 28 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions.\nHis passer rating was 112.2\n\nHappy coding!"
