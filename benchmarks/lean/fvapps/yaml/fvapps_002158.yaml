  You are given a rectangular parallelepiped with sides of positive integer lengths $A$, $B$ and $C$. 

  Find the number of different groups of three integers ($a$, $b$, $c$) such that $1\leq a\leq b\leq c$ and parallelepiped $A\times B\times C$ can be paved with parallelepipeds $a\times b\times c$. Note, that all small parallelepipeds have to be rotated in the same direction.

  For example, parallelepiped $1\times 5\times 6$ can be divided into parallelepipeds $1\times 3\times 5$, but can not be divided into parallelepipeds $1\times 2\times 3$.

  -----Input-----

  The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^5$) — the number of test cases.

  Each of the next $t$ lines contains three integers $A$, $B$ and $C$ ($1 \leq A, B, C \leq 10^5$) — the sizes of the parallelepiped.

  -----Output-----

  For each test case, print the number of different groups of three points that satisfy all given conditions.

  -----Example-----
  Input
  4
  1 1 1
  1 6 1
  2 2 2
  100 100 100

  Output
  1
  4
  4
  165

  -----Note-----

  In the first test case, rectangular parallelepiped $(1, 1, 1)$ can be only divided into rectangular parallelepiped with sizes $(1, 1, 1)$.

  In the second test case, rectangular parallelepiped $(1, 6, 1)$ can be divided into rectangular parallelepipeds with sizes $(1, 1, 1)$, $(1, 1, 2)$, $(1, 1, 3)$ and $(1, 1, 6)$.

  In the third test case, rectangular parallelepiped $(2, 2, 2)$ can be divided into rectangular parallelepipeds with sizes $(1, 1, 1)$, $(1, 1, 2)$, $(1, 2, 2)$ and $(2, 2, 2)$.
