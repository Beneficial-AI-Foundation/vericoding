  The characters of Chima need your help. Their weapons got mixed up! They need you to write a program that accepts the name of a character in Chima then tells which weapon he/she owns.

  For example: for the character `"Laval"` your program should return the solution `"Laval-Shado Valious"`

  You must complete the following character-weapon pairs:

  * Laval-Shado Valious, 
  * Cragger-Vengdualize, 
  * Lagravis-Blazeprowlor, 
  * Crominus-Grandorius, 
  * Tormak-Tygafyre, 
  * LiElla-Roarburn. 

  Return `"Not a character"` for invalid inputs.
