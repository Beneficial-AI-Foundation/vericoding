  *Recreation of [Project Euler problem #6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)*

  Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers `(1 <= n <= 100)` and the square of their sum.

  ## Example
  For example, when `n = 10`:

  * The square of the sum of the numbers is:

    (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)^(2) = 55^(2) = 3025

  * The sum of the squares of the numbers is:

   1^(2) + 2^(2) + 3^(2) + 4^(2) + 5^(2) + 6^(2) + 7^(2) + 8^(2) + 9^(2) + 10^(2) = 385

  Hence the difference between square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of those numbes is: 3025 - 385 = 2640
