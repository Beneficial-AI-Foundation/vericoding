  Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious. Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier — a machine which mutates minions.

  Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value. 

  Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.

  Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.

  -----Input Format:-----
  The first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines.
  The first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement.
  The next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions.

  -----Output Format:-----
  For each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.

  -----Constraints:-----
  - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
  - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
  - 1 ≤ K ≤ 100
  - All initial characteristic values lie between 1 and 105, both inclusive.

  -----Example-----
  Input:
  1
  5 10
  2 4 1 35 1

  Output:
  1

  -----Explanation:-----
  After transmogrification, the characteristic values become {12,14,11,45,11}, out of which only 14 is divisible by 7. So only the second minion becomes Wolverine-like.
