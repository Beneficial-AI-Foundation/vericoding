  Seven is a hungry number and its favourite food is number 9. Whenever it spots 9
  through the hoops of 8, it eats it! Well, not anymore, because you are 
  going to help the 9 by locating that particular sequence (7,8,9) in an array of digits
  and tell 7 to come after 9 instead. Seven "ate" nine, no more!
  (If 9 is not in danger, just return the same array)

  -- Apps difficulty: introductory
  -- Assurance level: guarded
  
  -- Result maintains same length
  
  -- Result only contains 7,8,9
  
  -- Counts are preserved
  
  -- Result is stable
  
  -- If no 7s or no 89 pattern, result unchanged
