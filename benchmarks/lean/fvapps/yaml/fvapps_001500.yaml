  Chef is interested to solve series problems. Chef wants to solve a series problem but he can't 
  solve it till now.Can you help Chef to solve the series problem?
  - In series problem, the series goes as follows 1,9,31,73,141 . . . . . . . . 
  Your task is to find the Nth term of series. For larger value of $N$ answer becomes very large, So your output should be performed $N$th term modulo 1000000007 ($10^9+7$ ).
  
  -----Input:-----
  - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
  - Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$. 
  
  -----Output:-----
  For each testcase,  output in a single line answer i.e. The $N$th term of series modulo 1000000007.
  
  -----Constraints-----
  - $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
  - $1 \leq N \leq 10^9$
  
  -----Sample Input:-----
