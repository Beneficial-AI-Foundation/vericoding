  Ever the learned traveller, Alan Partridge has pretty strong views on London:

  ```
  "Go to London. I guarantee you'll either be mugged or not appreciated.
  Catch the train to London, stopping at Rejection, Disappointment, Backstabbing Central and Shattered Dreams Parkway."
  ```
  Your job is to check that the provided list of stations contains all of the stops Alan mentions. There will be other stations in the array.  Example:

  ```
  ['Rejection', 'Disappointment', 'Backstabbing Central', 'Shattered Dreams Parkway']
  ```

  If the stations all appear, return 'Smell my cheese you mother!', if not,  return 'No, seriously, run. You will miss it.'.
