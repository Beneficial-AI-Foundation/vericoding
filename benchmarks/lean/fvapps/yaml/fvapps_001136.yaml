  Oliver and Nova are true lovers. Inspite of knowing that Nova will die Oliver married her at the lake where they met. But they had a conflict about even and odd numbers. Nova likes the odd numbers and Oliver prefers even. One day they went to a fair where Oliver bought some square shaped marshmallows and Nova bought some round shaped. Then they decided to play a game. They will pick a natural number N . Nova will sum up the odd numbers from 1 to N and and she will notedown LCM of R(R is defined in the picture) and the sum she calculated before. And Oliver will sum up the even numbers from 1 to N and and he will notedown LCM of S(S is defined in the picture) and the sum he calculated before. You must use the ceil value of R and S.
  
  Now  whose LCM is strictly greater than the other will win.If both of their LCM is equal Nova will win because Oliver is afraid of Nova.
  $N.B.$ define the value of pi with $acos(-1)$.
  $N.B.$ Sum of all odd number and sum of all even number will not exceed 10^18. 
  
  -----Input:-----
  The first line contains an integer $T$  — the number of test cases in the input. Next, T test cases are given, one per line.
  Each test case is a positive integer $N$  . 
  
  -----Output:-----
  Print T answers to the test cases.
  In each test cases,
  If Oliver wins the game, print "Nova's gonna kill me" (without quotes) .
  If Nova wins the game, print "YESS(sunglass emo)" (without quotes) .
  
  -----Constraints-----
  - $1 \leq T \leq 2000$
  - $1 \leq N \leq 1845271$
  
  -----Sample Input:-----

  111
  
  -----Sample Output:-----
  YESS(sunglass emo)
