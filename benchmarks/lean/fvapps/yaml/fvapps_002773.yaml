  X-Shape
  
  You will get an odd Integer n (>= 3) and your task is to draw a X. Each line is separated with '\n'.
  
  Use the following characters:  ■ □
  
  For Ruby, Crystal and PHP:   whitespace and o 
  
  e.g.:
  
                                       ■□□□■
              ■□■                      □■□■□
    x(3) =>   □■□              x(5)=>  □□■□□
              ■□■                      □■□■□
                                       ■□□□■
