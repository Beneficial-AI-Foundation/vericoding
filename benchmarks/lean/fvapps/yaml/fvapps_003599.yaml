  # Task
   You know the slogan `p`, which the agitators have been chanting for quite a while now. Roka has heard this slogan a few times, but he missed almost all of them and grasped only their endings. You know the string `r` that Roka has heard. 

   You need to determine what is the `minimal number` of times agitators repeated the slogan `p`, such that Roka could hear `r`.

   It is guaranteed the Roka heard nothing but the endings of the slogan P repeated several times.

  # Example

   For `p = "glorytoukraine", r = "ukraineaineaine"`, the output should be `3`.

   The slogan was `"glorytoukraine"`, and Roka heard `"ukraineaineaine"`.

   He could hear it as follows: `"ukraine"` + `"aine"` + `"aine"` = `"ukraineaineaine"`.

  # Input/Output

   - `[input]` string `p`

    The slogan the agitators chanted, a string of lowecase Latin letters.

   - `[input]` string `r`

    The string of lowercase Latin letters Roka has heard.

   - `[output]` an integer

    The `minimum number` of times the agitators chanted.
