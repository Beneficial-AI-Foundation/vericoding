  The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n×n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
  
  Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
  
  Example:
  
  Input: 4
  Output: 2
  Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown below.
  [
   [".Q..",  // Solution 1
    "...Q",
    "Q...",
    "..Q."],
  
   ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
    "Q...",
    "...Q",
    ".Q.."]
