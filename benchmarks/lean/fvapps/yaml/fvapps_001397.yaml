  Kshitij has recently started solving problems on codechef. As he is real problem solving enthusiast, he wants continuous growth in number of problems solved per day.
  He started with $a$  problems on first day. 
  He solves $d$ problems more than previous day. But after every $k$ days , he increases $d$ by
  $inc$ .
  Can you guess how many questions he will solve on $nth $ day ?
  
  -----Input:-----
  - First line  contains $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
  - Each testcase contains of a single line of input,five integers $a, d, k, n, inc$. 
  
  -----Output:-----
  For each testcase, output in a single line number of questions solved on $nth$ day.
  
  -----Constraints-----
  - $1 \leq T \leq 15$
  - $1 \leq a \leq 99$
  - $1 \leq d \leq 100$
  - $1 \leq n \leq 10000$
  - $1 \leq k \leq n$
  - $0 \leq inc \leq 99$
  
  -----Sample Input:-----
  1
  1 4 3 8 2
  
  -----Sample Output:-----
  43
  
  -----EXPLANATION:-----
  The number of questions solved in first 8 days is :
  $1$ $5$ $9$ $15$ $21$ $27$ $35$ $43$ .
  On first day he solved 1 problem . Here $d$ is  4 for first 3 days.
  Then after 3 days $d$ increases by 2 (that is 6).
