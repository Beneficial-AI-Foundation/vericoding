  $Harshad$ $Mehta$ is planning  a new scam with the stocks he is given a stock of  integer price S and a number K . $harshad$ has got the power to change the number $S$ at most $K$ times
  In order to raise the price of stock and now cash it for his benefits
  Find the largest price at which $harshad$ can sell the stock in order to maximize his profit 

  -----Input:-----
  - First line will contain $S$ and  $K$ , the price of the stock and the number K 

  -----Output:-----
  Print the largest profit  he can make in a single line.

  -----Constraints-----
  - S can take value upto 10^18
  NOTE: use 64 int number to fit range
  - K can take value from [0.. 9]

  -----Sample Input:-----
  4483 2

  -----Sample Output:-----
  9983

  -----EXPLANATION:-----
  First two digits of the number are changed to get the required number.
