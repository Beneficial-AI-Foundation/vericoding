  The name of our college is "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Berhampore". There is another college named "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Serampore". As the names are quite similar, those who are unaware of existence of both the colleges, often get confused. And mistake one with other.

  Given a string, if it contains the word berhampore (case insensitive), print GCETTB or if it contains serampore(case-insensitive), print GCETTS . If the string contains neither print Others. If it contains both Berhampore and Serampore print Both 
  Input 
  - First line contains single integer T, No. of test case  
  - Next line for every test contain case a string S 
  Output

  Print GCETTB or GCETTS or Others or Both on a new line
  Constraints 
  - 1 <= T <= 10 
  - 0 <= len(S) <= 100  
  - S contain a-z and A-Z and space only
  Sample Input

  SeRaMporE textile college 
  Girls college Kolkata

  Sample Output
