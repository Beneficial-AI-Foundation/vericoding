vc-description: |-
  /-
  Skier rides on a snowy field. Its movements can be described by a string of characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E' (which correspond to $1$ meter movement in the south, north, west or east direction respectively).

  It is known that if he moves along a previously unvisited segment of a path (i.e. this segment of the path is visited the first time), then the time of such movement is $5$ seconds. If he rolls along previously visited segment of a path (i.e., this segment of the path has been covered by his path before), then it takes $1$ second.

  Find the skier's time to roll all the path.

  -----Input-----

  The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.

  Each set is given by one nonempty string of the characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E'. The length of the string does not exceed $10^5$ characters.

  The sum of the lengths of $t$ given lines over all test cases in the input does not exceed $10^5$.

  -----Output-----

  For each test case, print the desired path time in seconds.
