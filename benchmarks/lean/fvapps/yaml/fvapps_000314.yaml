  Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.
  
  Example 1:
  
  Input: nums = [1,3], n = 6
  Output: 1 
  Explanation:
  Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
  Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
  Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
  So we only need 1 patch.
  
  Example 2:
  
  Input: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].
  
  Example 3:
  
  Input: nums = [1,2,2], n = 5
  Output: 0

  -- All results are natural numbers and input list remains sorted
  
  -- Empty list produces positive result
  
  -- Result is non-negative for small n
