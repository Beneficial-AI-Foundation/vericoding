  Today was a sad day. Having bought a new beard trimmer, I set it to the max setting and shaved away at my joyous beard. Stupidly, I hadnt checked just how long the max setting was, and now I look like Ive just started growing it!
  
  Your task, given a beard represented as an arrayof arrays, is to trim the beard as follows:
  
  ['|', 'J', '|', '|'],
  ['|', '|', '|', 'J'],
  ['...', '...', '...', '...'];
  
  To trim the beard use the following rules:
  
  trim any curled hair --> replace 'J' with '|'
  trim any hair from the chin (last array) --> replace '|' or 'J' with '...'
  
  All sub arrays will be same length. Return the corrected array of arrays
