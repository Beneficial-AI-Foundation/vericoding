vc-description: |-
  /-
  Your task is to build a model^(1) which can predict y-coordinate.
  You can pass tests if predicted y-coordinates are inside error margin.
  
  You will receive train set which should be used to build a model. 
  After you build a model tests will call function ```predict``` and pass x to it. 
  
  Error is going to be calculated with RMSE.
  
  Blocked libraries: sklearn, pandas, tensorflow, numpy, scipy
  
  Explanation
  [1] A mining model is created by applying an algorithm to data, but it is more than an algorithm or a metadata container: it is a set of data, statistics, and patterns that can be applied to new data to generate predictions and make inferences about relationships.
