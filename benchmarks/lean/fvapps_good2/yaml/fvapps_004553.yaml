  Among the ruins of an ancient city a group of archaeologists found a mysterious function with lots of HOLES in it called ```getNum(n)``` (or `get_num(n)` in ruby, python, or r). They tried to call it with some arguments. And finally they got this journal:
  The archaeologists were totally stuck with this challenge. They were all in desperation but then.... came YOU the SUPER-AWESOME programmer. Will you be able to understand the mystery of this function and rewrite it?
