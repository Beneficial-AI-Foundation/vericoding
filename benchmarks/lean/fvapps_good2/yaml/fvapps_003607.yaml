  # Task
   John is new to spreadsheets. He is well aware of rows and columns, but he is not comfortable with spreadsheets numbering system.
  ```
  Spreadsheet             Row Column
  A1                      R1C1
  D5                       R5C4
  AA48                    R48C27
  BK12                   R12C63```
  Since John has a lot of work to do both in row-column and spreadsheet systems, he needs a program that converts cell numbers from one system to another.
  
  # Example
  
   For `s = "A1"`, the result should be `"R1C1"`.
  
   For `s = "R48C27"`, the result should be `"AA48"`.
  
  - Input/Output
  
   - `[input]` string `s`
  
    The position (in spreadsheet or row-column numbering system).
  
    `Spreadsheet : A1 to CRXO65535`
  
    `Row-Column: R1C1 to R65535C65535`
  
   - `[output]` a string
  
    The position (in the opposite format; if input was in spreadsheet system, the output should be int row-column system, and vise versa).
