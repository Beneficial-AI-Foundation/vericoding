  The number ```89``` is the first positive integer that has a particular, curious property:
  
  The square of ```89``` is ```7921```; ```89² = 7921```
  
  The reverse of ```7921``` is ```1297```, and ```1297``` is a prime number.
  
  The cube of ```89``` is ```704969```; ```89³ = 704969```
  
  The reverse of ```704969``` is ```969407```, and ```969407``` is a prime number.
  
  The first four terms of this sequence having this special property are:
  ```
  n-th term      term value
      1               89 
      2              271
      3              325
      4              328
  ```
  
  Create a function ```sq_cub_rev_prime()```, that receives the ordinal number of the sequence and outputs its correspoding value.
  
  Use the above table to show how the function should work:
  ```python 
  sq_cub_rev_prime(1) == 89 
  sq_cub_rev_prime(2) == 271
  sq_cub_rev_prime(3) == 325
  sq_cub_rev_prime(4) == 328
  ```
  Your code will be tested up to the 250th term
  
  This is not a registered sequence of OESIS, so if you are one of the first ten people that solve this kata, you may have the privilege to register the sequence at https://oeis.org, with your name. If you do so, please, mention in your biography that you are a Codewarrior.
  
  Memoize your results to pass the tests.
  
  Enjoy it!
