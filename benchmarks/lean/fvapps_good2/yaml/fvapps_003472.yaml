  Consider X as the  aleatory  variable that count the number of letters in a word. Write a function that, give in input an array of words (strings), calculate the  variance  of X.
  Max decimal of the variance : 4.
  
  Some wiki: Variance ,
   Aleatory variable 
  
  Example:
  
  Consider "Hello" and "World":
  
  X is { 5 } with P(X = 5) = 1 beacuse the two words has the same length.  
  So E[X] = 5 x 1 = 5 and the standard formula for variance is E[(X - u)^2] so  1 x (5-5)^2 = 0
  or you can calculate with the other formula E[X^2] - E[X]^2 = 5^2 x 1 - 5^2 = 0
  
  Consider "Hi" and "World":
  
  X is { 2, 5 } with P(X = 5) = 1/2 and P(X = 2) = 1/2.  
  So E[X] = 5 x 1/2 + 2 x 1/2 = 3.5 and the standard formula for variance is E[(X - u)^2] so  1/2 x (2-3.5)^2 + 1/2 x (5 - 3.5)^2 = 2.25
  or you can calculate with the other formula E[X^2] - E[X]^2 = (5^2 x 1/2 + 2^2 x 1/2) - 3.5^2 = 2.25
