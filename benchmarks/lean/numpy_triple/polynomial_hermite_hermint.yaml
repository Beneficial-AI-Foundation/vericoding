At each iteration the resulting series is\n    **multiplied** by \`scl\` and an integration constant, \`k\`, is added.\n    The scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable.  (\"Buyer\n    beware\": note that, depending on what one is doing, one may want \`scl\`\n    to be the reciprocal of what one might expect; for more information,\n    see the Notes section below.)  The argument \`c\` is an array of\n    coefficients from low to high degree along each axis, e.g., [1,2,3]\n    represents the series \`\`H_0 + 2*H_1 + 3*H_2\`\` while [[1,2],[1,2]]\n    represents \`\`1*H_0(x)*H_0(y) + 1*H_1(x)*H_0(y) + 2*H_0(x)*H_1(y) +\n    2*H_1(x)*H_1(y)\`\` if axis=0 is \`\`x\`\` and axis=1 is \`\`y\`\`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    c : array_like\n        Array of Hermite series coefficients.

The value of the first integral at\n        \`\`lbnd\`\` is the first value in the list, the value of the second\n        integral at \`\`lbnd\`\` is the second value, etc.  If \`\`k == []\`\` (the\n        default), all constants are set to zero.  If \`\`m == 1\`\`, a single\n        scalar can be given instead of a list.\n    lbnd : scalar, optional\n        The lower bound of the integral.

Say one is making a linear change of\n    variable :math:\`u = ax + b\` in an integral relative to \`x\`.  Then\n    :math:\`dx = du/a\`, so one will need to set \`scl\` equal to\n    :math:\`1/a\` - perhaps not what one would have first thought.\n\n    Also note that, in general, the result of integrating a C-series needs\n    to be \"reprojected\" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,\n    the result of this function is \"unintuitive,\" albeit correct; see\n    Examples section below.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import hermint\n    >>> hermint([1,2,3]) # integrate once, value 0 at 0.\n    array([1. , 0.5, 0.5, 0.5])\n    >>> hermint([1,2,3], m=2) # integrate twice, value & deriv 0 at 0\n    array([-0.5       ,  0.5       ,  0.125     ,  0.08333333,  0.0625    ]) # may vary\n    >>> hermint([1,2,3], k=1) # integrate once, value 1 at 0.\n    array([2. , 0.5, 0.5, 0.5])\n    >>> hermint([1,2,3], lbnd=-1) # integrate once, value 0 at -1\n    array([-2. ,  0.5,  0.5,  0.5])\n    >>> hermint([1,2,3], m=2, k=[1,2], lbnd=-1)\n    array([ 1.66666667, -0.5       ,  0.125     ,  0.08333333,  0.0625    ]) # may vary",

  /-  Integrate a Hermite series.
  
  Returns the Hermite series coefficients integrated `m` times from `lbnd`.
  At each iteration the resulting series is multiplied by `scl` and an
  integration constant from `k` is added. -/

  /-  Specification: hermint integrates Hermite series coefficients.
  
  The specification captures:
  1. The output vector has size n + m (m additional coefficients from integration)
  2. Each integration adds one coefficient to the series
  3. The integration follows Hermite polynomial integration rules
  4. Integration constants from k are applied at each integration step
  5. Results are scaled by scl at each step
  
  For Hermite polynomials, the integration rule is:
  - ∫ H_n(x) dx = H_{n+1}(x)/(2(n+1)) + constant
  
  Mathematical properties:
  - The first coefficient of the result incorporates the integration constant to ensure
    the integral evaluates to the appropriate value at lbnd
  - For coefficient c[i] representing H_i, integration contributes c[i]/(2*(i+1)) to H_{i+1}
  - The scaling factor scl is applied after each integration step -/
