  /-  numpy.column_stack: Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.
      
      Takes a sequence of 1-D arrays and stacks them as columns to make a 
      single 2-D array. All input arrays must have the same length (number 
      of rows in the output).
      
      The result is represented as a flattened vector in column-major order,
      where elements from the same column are contiguous. For a result with
      'rows' rows and 'cols' columns, element at position (i, j) is stored
      at index j * rows + i in the flattened vector.
      
      This is a fundamental array manipulation operation that combines multiple
      1D arrays into a single 2D structure, useful for constructing matrices
      from column vectors.

  /-  Specification: column_stack creates a 2D array (as flattened vector) where
      each input array becomes a column.
      
      Precondition: cols > 0 (at least one input array)
      Postcondition: 
      - The result contains all elements from the input arrays
      - Elements are arranged in column-major order
      - The j-th column of the result contains all elements from arrays[j]
      - For 0 ≤ i < rows and 0 ≤ j < cols, the element at position (i,j)
        in the 2D view equals arrays[j][i] and is stored at index j*rows + i
