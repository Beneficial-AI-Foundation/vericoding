vc-description: |-
  /-  Returns a vector representing a linear polynomial off + scl*x.
      
      For the linear polynomial off + scl*x, this returns:
      - [off, scl] when scl ≠ 0 (degree 1 polynomial)
      - [off] when scl = 0 (degree 0 polynomial, constant)
      
      This follows NumPy's convention where coefficients are ordered from
      lowest to highest degree, so [off, scl] represents off + scl*x.
      
      We use Vector Float 2 to represent the general case, with the understanding
      that when scl = 0, the second coefficient is meaningless.

  /-  Specification: polyline creates correct linear polynomial representation.
      
      The function returns coefficients for the linear polynomial off + scl*x:
      - Always returns [off, scl] as a 2-element vector
      - When scl = 0, this represents the constant polynomial off
      - When scl ≠ 0, this represents the linear polynomial off + scl*x
      
      Key properties:
      1. Coefficient structure: coefficients are ordered from lowest to highest degree
      2. Constant term is always off (at index 0)
      3. Linear term coefficient is scl (at index 1)
      4. Evaluation property: at x=0, polynomial evaluates to off
      5. Slope property: derivative of polynomial is scl
      6. Mathematical correctness: represents polynomial off + scl*x
