  Compute the condition number of a square matrix using the 2-norm.
  
  The condition number of a matrix A is defined as ||A|| * ||A^(-1)||,
  where ||.|| is the matrix norm. For the 2-norm, this equals the ratio
  of the largest singular value to the smallest singular value.
  
  The condition number measures how sensitive the solution x is to errors 
  in b for the linear system Ax = b. A condition number of 1 indicates
  a perfectly conditioned matrix, while large condition numbers indicate
  ill-conditioned matrices.

  /-  
  Specification: The condition number is always non-negative and is at least 1 
  for any invertible matrix. This captures the fundamental mathematical 
  properties of condition numbers in linear algebra.
