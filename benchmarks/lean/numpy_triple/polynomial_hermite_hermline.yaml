vc-description: |-
  /-  Hermite series whose graph is a straight line.
      
      Creates a Hermite series representation for the line off + scl*x.
      Returns a 2-element vector where:
      - First element is the constant term (off)
      - Second element is the linear coefficient (scl/2)
      
      Note: When scl = 0, the second element is 0, representing a constant function.

  /-  Specification: hermline returns Hermite coefficients for a linear function.
      
      The Hermite series representation of off + scl*x has coefficients:
      - c₀ = off (constant term)
      - c₁ = scl/2 (linear term coefficient)
      
      These coefficients, when evaluated as a Hermite series, produce the 
      original linear function. The relationship comes from the fact that
      H₁(x) = 2x in the physicist's Hermite polynomials.
