  /-  numpy.ediff1d: The differences between consecutive elements of an array.
  
      Computes the differences between consecutive elements of an array.
      For an input array [a, b, c, d], returns [b-a, c-b, d-c].
      
      The function always returns a 1D array, and if necessary, the input
      will be flattened before the differences are taken.
      
      This is equivalent to ary.flat[1:] - ary.flat[:-1] in NumPy.

  /-  Specification: numpy.ediff1d returns a vector of differences between consecutive elements.
  
      Precondition: The input vector must have at least one element (enforced by type)
      Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = ary[i+1] - ary[i]
      
      Key properties:
      1. The result has length n for input of length n+1
      2. Each element represents the difference between consecutive elements
      3. The result is always 1D regardless of input shape
      4. Mathematically: result[i] = ary[i+1] - ary[i] for all valid i
