vc-description: |-
  /-  numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polydiv: Divide one polynomial by another.
  
      Returns the quotient-with-remainder of two polynomials c1 / c2.
      The arguments are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order term
      to highest, e.g., [1,2,3] represents 1 + 2*x + 3*x**2.
  
      The function performs polynomial long division, returning both
      the quotient and remainder such that c1 = c2 * quotient + remainder.
  -/
  
  /-  Specification: polydiv performs polynomial division with remainder.
  
      Precondition: The leading coefficient of c2 (highest degree term) is non-zero
      Postcondition: 
      - The division identity holds: c1 = c2 * quotient + remainder (as polynomials)
      - The remainder has degree less than the divisor (leading coefficients are zero)
      - When the divisor is a constant polynomial, the quotient is c1 scaled by 1/c2[0]
