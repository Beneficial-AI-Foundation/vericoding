  /-  Remove trailing zeros from a sequence of polynomial coefficients.
      Returns the sequence with trailing zeros removed. If the sequence would be empty 
      after trimming, returns the first element. Empty sequences are handled. -/
  
  /-  Specification: trimseq removes trailing zeros while preserving at least one element.
      For non-empty sequences, if the last element is non-zero, return the sequence unchanged.
      If the last element is zero, trim trailing zeros but always keep at least one element. -/
