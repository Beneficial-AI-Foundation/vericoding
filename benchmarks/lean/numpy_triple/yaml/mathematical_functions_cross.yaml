  /-  numpy.cross: Return the cross product of two (arrays of) vectors.
  
      The cross product of a and b in R^3 is a vector perpendicular to both a and b.
      For 3D vectors a = [a0, a1, a2] and b = [b0, b1, b2], the cross product is:
      c = [a1*b2 - a2*b1, a2*b0 - a0*b2, a0*b1 - a1*b0]
  
      This implementation focuses on the 3D case, which is the most common usage.
      The result vector is perpendicular to both input vectors according to the
      right-hand rule.

  /-  Specification: numpy.cross returns the cross product of two 3D vectors.
  
      Precondition: True (vectors must be 3D, enforced by type)
      Postcondition: 
      1. The result components follow the cross product formula
      2. The result is perpendicular to both input vectors (dot product is zero)
      3. Anti-commutativity: a × b = -(b × a)
      4. Bilinearity properties
      5. Zero property: if a and b are parallel, then a × b = 0
