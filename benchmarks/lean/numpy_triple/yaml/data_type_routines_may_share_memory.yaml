  /-  numpy.may_share_memory: Determine if two arrays might share memory.
  
      This function conservatively checks if two arrays might share memory.
      A return of True does not necessarily mean that the two arrays share any element.
      It just means that they might.
  
      Only the memory bounds of a and b are checked by default.
  -/
  
  /-  Specification: may_share_memory returns a boolean indicating whether two arrays might share memory.
  
      Precondition: True (no special preconditions needed)
      Postcondition: The function returns a boolean value. If the arrays are identical references,
      it must return True. For independent arrays, it may return False.
      The function is conservative - it can return True even when arrays don't actually share memory.
