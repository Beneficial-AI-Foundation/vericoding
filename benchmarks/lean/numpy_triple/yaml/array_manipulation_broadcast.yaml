  /-  numpy.broadcast: Produce an object that mimics broadcasting between two vectors.
  
      This simplified version handles broadcasting between a column vector (m × 1)
      and a row vector (1 × n), producing an object that represents the m × n
      broadcast result.
  
      The broadcast object allows iteration over all element pairs that would
      result from the broadcasting operation.
  -/
  
  /-  Specification: broadcast creates an object that correctly pairs elements
      according to NumPy broadcasting rules.
  
      For a column vector x of shape (m, 1) and row vector y of shape (1, n),
      the broadcast object has shape (m, n) and element (i, j) is the pair (x[i], y[j]).
  
      Preconditions: 
      - m > 0 (x is non-empty)
      - n > 0 (y is non-empty)
  
      Postconditions:
      - The resulting shape is (m, n)
      - Element at position (i, j) is the pair (x[i], y[j])
