  /-  numpy.diff: Calculate the n-th discrete difference along the given axis.
  
      The first difference is given by out[i] = a[i+1] - a[i] along the given axis.
      Higher differences are calculated by using diff recursively.
  
      For a 1D array, the first difference computes the difference between 
      consecutive elements, producing an array with one less element.
  
      The function is particularly useful for numerical analyses where 
      understanding incremental changes within data is crucial.
  -/
  
  /-  Specification: numpy.diff returns a vector where each element is the difference
      of consecutive elements from the input array.
  
      Precondition: Input array must be non-empty (at least 2 elements for first difference)
      Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = a[i+1] - a[i]
  
      Mathematical Properties:
      1. Length property: |result| = |input| - 1
      2. Difference property: Each element represents the discrete difference
      3. Type preservation: Result maintains the same numeric type as input
      4. Monotonicity: If input is monotonic, result has consistent sign
