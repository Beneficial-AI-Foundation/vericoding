  /-  Evaluate a 2D polynomial at points (x, y).
      Given a coefficient matrix c and evaluation points (x, y),
      computes p(x,y) = Σᵢⱼ cᵢⱼ·xⁱ·yʲ for each point pair -/
  
  /-  Specification: polyval2d evaluates a 2D polynomial with coefficient matrix c at point pairs (x, y).
      The result at each point (xᵢ, yᵢ) is the polynomial value p(xᵢ, yᵢ) = Σᵢⱼ cᵢⱼ·xᵢⁱ·yᵢʲ
      
      Mathematical properties:
      - For coefficient matrix c[i][j], evaluates p(x,y) = Σᵢⱼ c[i][j]·xⁱ·yʲ
      - Reduces to 1D polyval when one variable is zero: p(x,0) uses first column c[*][0]
      - Bilinear in coefficients: p(x,y, αc₁ + βc₂) = α·p(x,y,c₁) + β·p(x,y,c₂)  
      - Constant term: p(0,0) = c[0][0]
      - Degree-0 in both variables gives constant: c = [[c₀₀]] → p(x,y) = c₀₀ for all (x,y) -/
