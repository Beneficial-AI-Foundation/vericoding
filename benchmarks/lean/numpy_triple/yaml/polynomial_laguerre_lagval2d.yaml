  /-  Evaluate a 2-D Laguerre series at points (x, y).
      The mathematical formula is: p(x,y) = sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * L_i(x) * L_j(y)
      where L_i(x) and L_j(y) are the Laguerre polynomials. -/
  
  /-  Specification for 2-D Laguerre series evaluation:
      The result has the same shape as the input x and y vectors.
      The function evaluates a bivariate Laguerre polynomial series
      using the tensor product of 1-D Laguerre polynomials. -/
