  /-  Return the cumulative product of array elements treating NaNs as 1.
      The cumulative product does not change when NaNs are encountered and leading NaNs are replaced by ones. -/
  
  /-  Specification: nancumprod returns the cumulative product while treating NaN values as 1.
      This means:
      1. The resulting array has the same size as the input
      2. Each element is the product of all non-NaN elements from the start up to that position
      3. NaN values are treated as 1 in the product calculation
      4. Leading NaNs are replaced by ones
      5. The cumulative product property holds for non-NaN values -/
