The resulting points form a grid with\n    `x` in the first dimension and `y` in the second.\n\n    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are\n    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In either\n    case, either `x` and `y` or their elements must support multiplication\n    and addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.\n\n    If `c` has fewer than two dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to\n    its shape to make it 2-D.

  /-  Specification: polygrid2d evaluates a 2-D polynomial on the Cartesian product of x and y.
      The result is a grid where result[i][j] = p(x[i], y[j]) for the polynomial defined by 
      coefficients c, where p(a,b) = sum_{i,j} c[i][j] * a^i * b^j. -/
