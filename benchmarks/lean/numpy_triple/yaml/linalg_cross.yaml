  /-  numpy.linalg.cross: Return the cross product of 3-element vectors.
  
      Computes the cross product of two 3-element vectors. The cross product
      of two vectors a and b is a vector perpendicular to both a and b.
  
      For 3D vectors a = [a₀, a₁, a₂] and b = [b₀, b₁, b₂], the cross product
      is defined as:
      a × b = [a₁b₂ - a₂b₁, a₂b₀ - a₀b₂, a₀b₁ - a₁b₀]
  
      This follows the right-hand rule convention.

  /-  Specification: numpy.linalg.cross returns the cross product of two 3D vectors.
  
      Precondition: True (both vectors must be 3-dimensional, enforced by type)
  
      Postcondition: The result is a 3D vector where:
      - result[0] = x1[1] * x2[2] - x1[2] * x2[1]
      - result[1] = x1[2] * x2[0] - x1[0] * x2[2]  
      - result[2] = x1[0] * x2[1] - x1[1] * x2[0]
  
      The cross product has the mathematical property that it is perpendicular
      to both input vectors (i.e., result · x1 = 0 and result · x2 = 0).
