  /-  Move axes in a 1D vector (simplified version).
      For 1D arrays, moveaxis with source=0 and destination=0 returns the array unchanged.
      This captures the core mathematical property that moving an axis to itself is identity. -/
  
  /-  Specification: moveaxis preserves all elements and their values.
      For 1D arrays, moveaxis is always the identity function since there's only one axis.
      This specification captures several mathematical properties:
      1. Element preservation: all values remain unchanged
      2. Size preservation: the shape is maintained
      3. Identity property: moving axis 0 to position 0 is identity
      4. Order preservation: for 1D arrays, element order is maintained -/
