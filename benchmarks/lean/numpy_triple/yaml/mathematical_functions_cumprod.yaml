  /-  numpy.cumprod: Return the cumulative product of elements along a given axis.
  
      For a vector [a₁, a₂, a₃, ..., aₙ], returns [a₁, a₁*a₂, a₁*a₂*a₃, ..., a₁*a₂*...*aₙ].
  
      This function computes the cumulative product by applying successive multiplications
      from left to right, producing a result vector of the same length as the input.
  
      The cumulative product is computed as: result[i] = ∏(k=0 to i) input[k]
  
      For empty vectors, returns an empty vector.
  -/
  
  /-  Specification: cumprod returns the cumulative product of elements.
  
      Precondition: True (works for any vector, including empty)
      Postcondition: 
      - Result has same length as input
      - For any index i, result[i] = product of all elements from a[0] to a[i] inclusive
      - Equivalently: result[i] = a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[i]
      - For empty vectors, returns empty vector (vacuous condition holds)
  
      Mathematical Properties:
      - result[0] = a[0] (when n > 0)
      - result[i+1] = result[i] * a[i+1] (cumulative property)
      - Each element is the product of all preceding elements (including itself)
