  /-  Cross-correlation of two 1-dimensional sequences in 'valid' mode.
      Computes c_k = sum_i a_{k+i} * v_i for positions where both sequences fully overlap. -/
  
  /-  Specification: correlate computes cross-correlation with valid mode overlap.
      Each output element is the sum of products of overlapping elements from the input sequences.
  
      Mathematical properties:
      1. The result has size (m + 1 - n) for valid mode
      2. Each output element k is computed as: sum_i a[k+i] * v[i] for i in [0, n-1]
      3. Only positions where both sequences fully overlap are computed
      4. The correlation preserves the mathematical definition of cross-correlation -/
