  /-  Hermite series whose graph is a straight line.
      Returns the Hermite series coefficients representing the linear function off + scl*x.
      For non-zero scale, returns [off, scl]. For zero scale, returns [off]. -/
  
  /-  Specification: hermeline returns the correct Hermite series coefficients for a linear function.
      The returned coefficients represent the polynomial off + scl*x in Hermite series form.
  
      Mathematical properties:
      - Always returns a vector of size 2 (degree 1 polynomial or constant with zero coefficient)
      - First coefficient (index 0) is always the offset term
      - Second coefficient (index 1) is the scale term when scl ≠ 0, or 0 when scl = 0
      - Models the linear function f(x) = off + scl*x
      - When scl = 0, represents the constant function f(x) = off
      - When scl ≠ 0, represents the linear function f(x) = off + scl*x
      - Preserves the mathematical structure of polynomial coefficients
