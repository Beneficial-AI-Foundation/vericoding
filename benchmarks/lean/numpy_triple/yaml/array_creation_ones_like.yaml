vc-description: |-
  /-  Return a vector of ones with the same length as the input vector.
      This is the 1D version of numpy.ones_like which creates a new vector
      filled with ones, having the same size as the input vector. -/
  
  /-  Specification: ones_like returns a vector where every element is 1,
      with the same length as the input vector.
  
      Mathematical properties:
      1. The result has the same length as the input (enforced by type system)
      2. Every element in the result is exactly 1
      3. The result is independent of the input values (only depends on shape) -/
