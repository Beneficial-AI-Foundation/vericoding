  /-  Compute the vector dot product of two vectors -/
  
  /-  Specification: vecdot computes the mathematical dot product as the sum of element-wise products.
      This captures the mathematical definition: a · b = Σ(i=0 to n-1) a_i * b_i.
  
      Key properties:
      - Commutativity: vecdot(x1, x2) = vecdot(x2, x1)
      - Linearity: vecdot(c*x1, x2) = c * vecdot(x1, x2)
      - Zero vector: vecdot(0, x) = 0
      - Self-dot gives sum of squares: vecdot(x, x) = Σ(x_i²)
