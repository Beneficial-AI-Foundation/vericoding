  /-  numpy.strings.lstrip: For each element in a vector, return a copy with the leading characters removed.
  
      Removes leading characters from each string element in the input vector. The behavior
      depends on the chars parameter:
      - If chars is None, whitespace characters are removed from the beginning
      - If chars is provided, any combination of those characters is removed from the beginning
  
      The function preserves the shape of the input array and handles empty strings
      appropriately by returning them unchanged.
  
      From NumPy documentation:
      - Parameters: a (array_like) - Input array with string dtype
                    chars (optional) - Characters to remove from the beginning
      - Returns: out (ndarray) - Output array with leading characters removed
  
      Mathematical Properties:
      1. Element-wise transformation: result[i] = lstrip(a[i], chars) for all i
      2. Length preservation or reduction: result[i].length ≤ a[i].length for all i
      3. Prefix removal: result[i] is a suffix of a[i] for all i
      4. Character set removal: only characters in chars are removed from the beginning
      5. Preserves vector length: result.size = a.size

  /-  Specification: numpy.strings.lstrip returns a vector where each string element
      has its leading characters removed according to the chars parameter.
  
      Mathematical Properties:
      1. Element-wise correctness: Each element is correctly processed for leading character removal
      2. Length preservation or reduction: Each result string is no longer than the original
      3. Prefix removal: Each result is a suffix of the original string
      4. Character set stripping: Only characters in chars are removed from the beginning
      5. Whitespace default: When chars is None, whitespace characters are removed
      6. Stopping condition: Stripping stops at the first non-matching character
      7. Empty string handling: Empty strings remain empty
      8. No middle/end modification: Characters beyond the leading portion are unchanged
  
      Precondition: True (no special preconditions for lstrip)
      Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] is a[i] with leading characters removed
