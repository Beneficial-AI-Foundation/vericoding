  /-  numpy.sinc: Return the normalized sinc function, element-wise.
  
      The sinc function is defined as:
      - sin(π*x)/(π*x) for x ≠ 0
      - 1 for x = 0
  
      This is the normalized sinc function, which is used in signal processing and
      Fourier analysis. The function is continuous everywhere and has its maximum
      value of 1 at x = 0.
  
      Returns a vector of the same shape as the input, containing the sinc value
      of each element.
  -/
  
  /-  Specification: numpy.sinc returns a vector where each element is the
      normalized sinc function of the corresponding element in x.
  
      The specification captures key mathematical properties:
      1. Element-wise computation: result[i] = sinc(x[i])
      2. Definition: sinc(x) = sin(π*x)/(π*x) for x ≠ 0, and 1 for x = 0
      3. Continuity: sinc(0) = 1 (limit as x approaches 0)
      4. Symmetry: sinc(-x) = sinc(x) (even function)
      5. Zeros: sinc(x) = 0 for x = k where k is any non-zero integer
      6. Boundedness: |sinc(x)| ≤ 1 for all x
      7. Maximum value: sinc(0) = 1 is the global maximum
  
      The specification is formalized to be mathematically precise while 
      remaining implementable with Float types.
