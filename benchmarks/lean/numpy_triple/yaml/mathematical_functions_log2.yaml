  /-  numpy.log2: Base-2 logarithm of x, element-wise.
  
      The base-2 logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function with base 2,
      so that log2(2^x) = x. This is useful for computing the number of bits needed
      to represent a number or for operations involving powers of 2.
  
      Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the base-2 logarithm
      of each element in x.
  -/
  
  /-  Specification: log2 returns a vector where each element is the base-2
      logarithm of the corresponding element in x.
  
      Precondition: All elements must be positive (x[i] > 0) since the logarithm
      is only defined for positive real numbers.
  
      Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = Float.log2 x[i]
  
      Mathematical properties:
      - log2(2^x) = x for any x
      - log2(x * y) = log2(x) + log2(y) for positive x, y
      - log2(x / y) = log2(x) - log2(y) for positive x, y
      - log2(1) = 0
      - log2(2) = 1
