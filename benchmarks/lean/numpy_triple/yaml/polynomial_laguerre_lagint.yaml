At each iteration the resulting series is\n    **multiplied** by \`scl\` and an integration constant, \`k\`, is added.\n    The scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable.  (\"Buyer\n    beware\": note that, depending on what one is doing, one may want \`scl\`\n    to be the reciprocal of what one might expect; for more information,\n    see the Notes section below.)  The argument \`c\` is an array of\n    coefficients from low to high degree along each axis, e.g., [1,2,3]\n    represents the series \`\`L_0 + 2*L_1 + 3*L_2\`\` while [[1,2],[1,2]]\n    represents \`\`1*L_0(x)*L_0(y) + 1*L_1(x)*L_0(y) + 2*L_0(x)*L_1(y) +\n    2*L_1(x)*L_1(y)\`\` if axis=0 is \`\`x\`\` and axis=1 is \`\`y\`\`.\n\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    c : array_like\n        Array of Laguerre series coefficients.

The value of the first integral at\n        \`\`lbnd\`\` is the first value in the list, the value of the second\n        integral at \`\`lbnd\`\` is the second value, etc.  If \`\`k == []\`\` (the\n        default), all constants are set to zero.  If \`\`m == 1\`\`, a single\n        scalar can be given instead of a list.\n    lbnd : scalar, optional\n        The lower bound of the integral.

Say one is making a linear change of\n    variable :math:\`u = ax + b\` in an integral relative to \`x\`.  Then\n    :math:\`dx = du/a\`, so one will need to set \`scl\` equal to\n    :math:\`1/a\` - perhaps not what one would have first thought.\n\n    Also note that, in general, the result of integrating a C-series needs\n    to be \"reprojected\" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,\n    the result of this function is \"unintuitive,\" albeit correct; see\n    Examples section below.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagint\n    >>> lagint([1,2,3])\n    array([ 1.,  1.,  1., -3.])\n    >>> lagint([1,2,3], m=2)\n    array([ 1.,  0.,  0., -4.,  3.])\n    >>> lagint([1,2,3], k=1)\n    array([ 2.,  1.,  1., -3.])\n    >>> lagint([1,2,3], lbnd=-1)\n    array([11.5,  1. ,  1. , -3. ])\n    >>> lagint([1,2], m=2, k=[1,2], lbnd=-1)\n    array([ 11.16666667,  -5.        ,  -3.        ,   2.        ]) # may vary",

  /-  numpy.polynomial.laguerre.lagint: Integrate a Laguerre series.
  
      Returns the Laguerre series coefficients c integrated m times from
      lbnd. At each iteration the resulting series is multiplied by scl 
      and an integration constant k is added. The scaling factor is for use 
      in a linear change of variable.
  
      The argument c is a vector of coefficients from low to high degree,
      e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series L_0 + 2*L_1 + 3*L_2.

  /-  Specification: lagint integrates a Laguerre series.
  
      Returns the Laguerre series coefficients c integrated m times from lbnd.
      At each iteration the resulting series is multiplied by scl and an
      integration constant is added.
  
      Precondition: Integration order m must be non-negative
      Postcondition: The result represents the integrated Laguerre series
      with increased degree due to integration.
  
      Mathematical properties:
      1. The result has degree n + m - 1 (m integrations increase degree by m)
      2. Integration is linear: lagint(α*c1 + β*c2) = α*lagint(c1) + β*lagint(c2) 
      3. For zero coefficients, integration with constants gives the constant
      4. Multiple integrations accumulate degree increases
