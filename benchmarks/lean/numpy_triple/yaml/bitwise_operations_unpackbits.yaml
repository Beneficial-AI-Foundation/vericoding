A non-negative number means to only unpack count bits. A negative number means to trim off that many bits from the end. None means to unpack the entire array (the default). Counts larger than the available number of bits will add zero padding to the output. Negative counts must not exceed the available number of bits.\nbitorder : {'big', 'little'}, optional\n    The order of the returned bits. 'big' will mimic bin(val), 3 = 0b00000011 => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], 'little' will reverse the order to [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    Defaults to 'big'.\n\nReturns\n-------\nunpacked : ndarray, uint8 type\n    The elements are binary-valued (0 or 1).\n\nExamples\n--------\n>>> a = np.array([[2], [7], [23]], dtype=np.uint8)\n>>> a\narray([[ 2],\n       [ 7],\n       [23]], dtype=uint8)\n>>> b = np.unpackbits(a, axis=1)\n>>> b\narray([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n       [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]], dtype=uint8)",

  /-  numpy.unpackbits: Unpacks elements of a uint8 array into a binary-valued output array.
  
      Each element of the input array represents a bit-field that is unpacked into
      a binary-valued output array. By default, each uint8 value is unpacked into
      8 binary values (0 or 1) using big-endian bit order.
  
      This specification covers the basic 1D case with default parameters.
      For simplicity, we use Nat instead of UInt8, with the constraint that input values < 256.
  -/
  
  /-  Specification: numpy.unpackbits unpacks each uint8 element into 8 binary values.
  
      Precondition: All input elements must be valid uint8 values (< 256)
      Postcondition: Each input element a[i] is unpacked into 8 bits in big-endian order,
                     where bit j of element i is stored at position i*8 + j in the result.
                     The bit extraction follows: (a[i] >> (7-j)) & 1
