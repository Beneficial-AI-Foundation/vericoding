  /-  numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebder: Differentiate a Chebyshev series.
  
      Returns the Chebyshev series coefficients differentiated once.
      The differentiation is based on the recurrence relations for Chebyshev
      polynomials. The derivative is multiplied by a scaling factor.
  
      For a Chebyshev series c₀T₀ + c₁T₁ + c₂T₂ + ..., the derivative
      follows specific recurrence relations that differ from standard polynomials.
  
      The derivative of T_n is n*U_{n-1}, where U_{n-1} can be expressed
      in terms of Chebyshev polynomials T_k using specific recurrence relations.

  /-  Specification: chebder differentiates a Chebyshev series once.
  
      The Chebyshev derivative algorithm works by:
      1. Creating a working copy of the coefficients
      2. Applying the recurrence relation from high to low order
      3. Scaling the result
  
      The recurrence relation for Chebyshev derivatives is:
      - For j ≥ 2: der[j] = 2*(j+1)*c[j+1], and c[j-2] += j*c[j]/(j-2)
      - For j = 1: der[1] = 4*c[2]
      - For j = 0: der[0] = c[1]
  
      All results are then multiplied by the scaling factor.
  
      Mathematical property: If p(x) = Σ c[i]*T_i(x), then 
      p'(x) = Σ der[i]*T_i(x) where der = chebder(c, scl).
  
      Precondition: True (works for any non-empty vector)
      Postcondition: 
      - The result has size n
      - The coefficients follow the Chebyshev derivative recurrence relations
      - The result represents scl times the derivative of the input series
