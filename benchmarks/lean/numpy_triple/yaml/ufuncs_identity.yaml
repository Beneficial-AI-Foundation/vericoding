  /-  ufunc.identity: Get the identity element for a ufunc operation.
  
      Returns the identity element for a given binary operation, which is the value
      that when combined with any other value using that operation, leaves the other
      value unchanged. For example:
      - Addition: identity is 0 (x + 0 = x)
      - Multiplication: identity is 1 (x * 1 = x)
      - Logical AND: identity is True (x ∧ True = x)
      - Logical OR: identity is False (x ∨ False = x)
  
      Some operations may have no identity element, in which case None is returned.
  -/
  
  /-  Specification: ufunc_identity returns the identity element if it exists.
  
      Precondition: The operation is a valid binary function
      Postcondition: If an identity element exists, applying the operation with
                     that element leaves any other element unchanged
