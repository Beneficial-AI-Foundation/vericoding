Here is a fully general summary:\n\nGiven an \"index\" array (a) of integers and a sequence of n arrays (choices), a and each choice array are first broadcast, as necessary, to arrays of a common shape; calling these Ba and Bchoices[i], i = 0,...,n-1 we have that, necessarily, Ba.shape == Bchoices[i].shape for each i. Then, a new array with shape Ba.shape is created as follows:\n\n- if mode='raise' (the default), then, first of all, each element of a (and thus Ba) must be in the range [0, n-1]; now, suppose that i (in that range) is the value at the (j0, j1, ..., jm) position in Ba - then the value at the same position in the new array is the value in Bchoices[i] at that same position;\n\n- if mode='wrap', values in a (and thus Ba) may be any (signed) integer; modular arithmetic is used to map integers outside the range [0, n-1] back into that range; and then the new array is constructed as above;\n\n- if mode='clip', values in a (and thus Ba) may be any (signed) integer; negative integers are mapped to 0; values greater than n-1 are mapped to n-1; and then the new array is constructed as above.",

  /-  Construct an array from an index array and a set of arrays to choose from.
      Given an index vector 'indices' and a vector of choice vectors 'choices',
      constructs a result vector where each element is selected from the corresponding
      choice vector based on the index value at that position.
  
      For each position i in the result, result[i] = choices[indices[i]][i]
  
      This is a simplified version focusing on the core functionality with 'raise' mode,
      where all indices must be valid (in range [0, num_choices-1]). -/
  
  /-  Specification: choose constructs an array by selecting elements from choice arrays
      based on index values. Each position in the result is filled by selecting from
      the corresponding choice array at that position using the index value.
  
      Mathematical properties:
      1. The result has the same length as the index array
      2. For each position i, result[i] = choices[indices[i]][i]
      3. All indices must be valid (enforced by Fin type)
  
      The function essentially implements: result[i] = choices[indices.get i].get i
  
      This captures the core behavior of numpy.choose in 'raise' mode where indices
      must be in valid range. The use of Fin type ensures type safety and eliminates
      the need for runtime bounds checking. -/
