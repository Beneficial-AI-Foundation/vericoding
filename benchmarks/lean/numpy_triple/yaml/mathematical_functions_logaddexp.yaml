  /-  numpy.logaddexp: Logarithm of the sum of exponentiations of the inputs.
  
      Calculates log(exp(x1) + exp(x2)) element-wise. This function is useful 
      in statistics where the calculated probabilities of events may be so small 
      as to exceed the range of normal floating point numbers.
  
      The logaddexp function provides a numerically stable way to compute
      log(exp(x1) + exp(x2)) without intermediate overflow or underflow.
  
      Mathematical properties:
      - logaddexp(x, x) = x + log(2)
      - logaddexp(x, -∞) = x
      - logaddexp(-∞, x) = x
      - logaddexp is symmetric: logaddexp(x, y) = logaddexp(y, x)
      - logaddexp is associative in the sense that it satisfies the log-sum-exp properties
      - logaddexp(x, y) ≥ max(x, y) for all x, y
  
      From NumPy documentation:
      - Parameters: x1, x2 (array_like) - Input arrays
      - Returns: ndarray - The element-wise logaddexp of the inputs
  -/
  
  /-  Specification: numpy.logaddexp returns a vector where each element is the
      logarithm of the sum of exponentiations of the corresponding elements.
  
      Mathematical Properties:
      1. Element-wise correctness: result[i] = log(exp(x1[i]) + exp(x2[i]))
      2. Commutativity: logaddexp(x1, x2) = logaddexp(x2, x1)
      3. Numerical stability: avoids intermediate overflow/underflow
      4. Bounds: logaddexp(x, y) ≥ max(x, y) for all x, y
      5. Special cases: 
         - logaddexp(x, x) = x + log(2)
         - logaddexp(x, -∞) = x (when x is finite)
         - logaddexp(-∞, x) = x (when x is finite)
      6. Monotonicity: logaddexp is monotonically increasing in both arguments
      7. Associativity property: satisfies log-sum-exp algebraic relations
  
      Precondition: True (logaddexp is defined for all real numbers)
      Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = log(exp(x1[i]) + exp(x2[i]))
                     and result[i] ≥ max(x1[i], x2[i])
