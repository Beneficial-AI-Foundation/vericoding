A tuple (possible only as a\n    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.\nwhere : array_like, optional\n    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the\n    condition is True, the out array will be set to the ufunc result.\n    Elsewhere, the out array will retain its original value.\n    Note that if an uninitialized out array is created via the default\n    out=None, locations within it where the condition is False will\n    remain uninitialized.\n**kwargs\n    For other keyword-only arguments, see the\n    ufunc docs.\n\nReturns\n-------\nout : ndarray or scalar\n    Output array, element-wise comparison of x1 and x2.\n    Typically of type bool, unless dtype=object is passed.\n    This is a scalar if both x1 and x2 are scalars.\n\nSee Also\n--------\ngreater, less, greater_equal, equal, not_equal\n\nExamples\n--------\n>>> np.less_equal([4, 2, 1], [2, 2, 2])\narray([False,  True,  True])"
