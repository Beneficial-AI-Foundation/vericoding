  /-  numpy.ndim: Return the number of dimensions of an array.
  
      In our Vector-based framework, vectors are always 1-dimensional.
      This function returns 1 for any vector input, representing the fact
      that Vector T n is a 1D array with n elements.
  
      Note: In NumPy, scalars are 0-dimensional, but in our framework,
      we represent them as Vector T 1, so this always returns 1.
  -/
  
  /-  Specification: numpy.ndim returns the number of dimensions, which is always 1 for vectors.
  
      Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
      Postcondition: The result is always 1 since Vector α n represents a 1-dimensional array
  
      This specification captures the mathematical property that all vectors in our
      framework are 1-dimensional arrays, regardless of their element type or size.
