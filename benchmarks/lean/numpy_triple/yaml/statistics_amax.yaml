By default, flattened input is used.\n    If this is a tuple of ints, the maximum is selected over multiple axes,\n    instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.\nout : ndarray, optional\n    Alternative output array in which to place the result. Must be of the same\n    shape and buffer length as the expected output.\nkeepdims : bool, optional\n    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result\n    as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast\n    correctly against the input array.\ninitial : scalar, optional\n    The minimum value of an output element. Must be present to allow computation\n    on empty slice.\nwhere : array_like of bool, optional\n    Elements to compare for the maximum.\n\nReturns\n-------\namax : ndarray or scalar\n    Maximum of a. If axis is None, the result is a scalar value. If axis is given,\n    the result is an array of dimension a.ndim - 1.\n\nNotes\n-----\nNaN values are propagated, that is if at least one item is NaN, the corresponding\nmax value will be NaN as well. To ignore NaN values (MATLAB behavior), please use\nnanmax.\n\nDon't use amax for element-wise comparison of 2 arrays; when a.shape[0] is 2,\nmaximum(a[0], a[1]) is faster than amax(a, axis=0).",

  /-  Returns the maximum value of all elements in a non-empty vector -/
  
  /-  Specification: amax returns the maximum value in the vector.
      Mathematical properties:
      1. The result is an element that exists in the vector
      2. No element in the vector is greater than the result
      3. The result is unique (first occurrence if there are duplicates)
      4. For constant vectors, amax equals the constant value -/
