  /-  Differentiate a Hermite_e series by taking the derivative of coefficients.
      Takes coefficients from low to high degree and returns differentiated coefficients. -/
  
  /-  Specification: hermeder correctly differentiates Hermite_e series coefficients.
      The result has degree reduced by 1, and each coefficient is multiplied by its index
      and scaled by scl^m. For a single differentiation (m=1), the coefficient of degree k
      becomes k * scl * original_coefficient. -/
