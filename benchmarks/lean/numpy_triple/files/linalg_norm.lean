/-  numpy.linalg.norm: Compute the 2-norm (Euclidean norm) of a vector.

    This is the default vector norm when ord=None. For a vector x,
    the 2-norm is defined as: ||x||_2 = sqrt(sum(x[i]^2))

    This implementation focuses on the most common use case: computing
    the Euclidean norm of a 1D vector.

/-  Specification: norm computes the Euclidean norm (2-norm) of a vector.

    The 2-norm is defined as the square root of the sum of squares of all elements.
    This is the most common vector norm used in numerical computing and is the
    default norm in NumPy when ord=None.

    Mathematical definition:
    - For a vector x = [x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ], the 2-norm is: ||x||₂ = √(Σᵢ xᵢ²)

    Key properties verified:
    1. Definition: result equals sqrt of sum of squared elements
    2. Non-negativity: norm(x) ≥ 0 for all x
    3. Definiteness: norm(x) = 0 if and only if x is the zero vector
    4. Empty vector: norm of empty vector is 0

    Note: Properties like triangle inequality and homogeneity follow from
    the definition but are not explicitly stated in this specification.
