/-  NumPy's boolean scalar type representing True.
    This is NumPy's equivalent of Python's built-in True, but as a NumPy scalar type.
    Comparison operations in NumPy return this type instead of Python's bool. -/

/-  Specification: numpy.True_ represents the boolean value true and has the following properties:
    1. It equals the Lean boolean true
    2. It is the identity element for logical AND operations
    3. It is the absorbing element for logical OR operations
    4. Its negation gives false -/
