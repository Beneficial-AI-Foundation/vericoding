/-  numpy.c_: Translates slice objects to concatenation along the second axis.
    
    This function takes two vectors and stacks them as columns to create a 2-D array.
    Each input vector becomes a column in the resulting matrix.
    
    This is equivalent to column_stack([arr1, arr2]) for 1-D arrays.
-/

/-  Specification: c_ creates a 2-D array by stacking two vectors as columns.
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
    Postcondition: For all row indices i, result[i] is a vector of length 2
    where result[i][0] = arr1[i] and result[i][1] = arr2[i]
