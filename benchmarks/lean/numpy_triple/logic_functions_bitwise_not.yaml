  /-  numpy.bitwise_not: Compute bit-wise inversion, or bit-wise NOT, element-wise.
  
      Computes the bit-wise NOT of the underlying binary representation of
      the integers in the input arrays. This ufunc implements the C/Python
      operator ~.
  
      For signed integer inputs, the bit-wise NOT of the absolute value is
      returned. In a two's-complement system, this operation effectively flips
      all the bits, which results in -(x + 1). This is the most common method
      of representing signed integers on computers.
  
      Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the bitwise NOT values.
  -/

  /-  Specification: numpy.bitwise_not returns a vector where each element is the
      bitwise NOT of the corresponding element in x.
  
      Precondition: True (no special preconditions for bitwise NOT)
      Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = -(x[i] + 1)
      
      This specification captures the mathematical property that bitwise NOT
      of an integer x in two's complement representation equals -(x + 1).
      
      Key properties:
      - Bitwise NOT is its own inverse: ~~x = x
      - For any integer x: ~x = -(x + 1)
      - The operation is element-wise for arrays
