  /-  numpy.polynomial.hermite.hermadd: Add one Hermite series to another.
  
      Returns the sum of two Hermite series c1 + c2. The arguments are
      sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to highest,
      i.e., [1,2,3] represents the series P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2.
  
      Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Hermite series
      is a Hermite series (without having to "reproject" the result onto
      the basis set) so addition, just like that of "standard" polynomials,
      is simply "component-wise."
  
      This version handles adding two Hermite coefficient vectors where the
      result length is the maximum of the input lengths. Shorter vectors are
      implicitly padded with zeros.

  /-  Specification: hermadd performs component-wise addition of Hermite series coefficients.
  
      Precondition: True (no special preconditions for basic addition)
      Postcondition: 
      - If i < min(n,m), result[i] = c1[i] + c2[i]
      - If min(n,m) ≤ i < n, result[i] = c1[i] (c2 is treated as 0)
      - If min(n,m) ≤ i < m, result[i] = c2[i] (c1 is treated as 0)
      
      The mathematical property: The i-th coefficient of the sum is the sum of
      the i-th coefficients of the input series, treating missing coefficients as 0.
