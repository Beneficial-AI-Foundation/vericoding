  /-  Return elements chosen from x or y depending on condition.
      Given vectors of equal length for condition, x, and y, constructs a result vector
      where each element is selected from x if the corresponding condition is true,
      otherwise from y.
      
      This implements the core ternary conditional operation:
      result[i] = condition[i] ? x[i] : y[i]
      
      The function requires all three input vectors to have the same length, which
      is enforced by the type system using Vector types. -/

  /-  Specification: where returns elements chosen from x or y based on condition.
      This captures the essential behavior of numpy.where function:
      
      Mathematical properties:
      1. The result has the same length as all input vectors
      2. For each position i, if condition[i] is true, then result[i] = x[i]
      3. For each position i, if condition[i] is false, then result[i] = y[i]
      4. The function is deterministic - same inputs always produce same output
      5. The result is well-defined for all inputs (no partial functions)
      
      This specification captures the core ternary conditional semantics:
      result[i] = if condition.get i then x.get i else y.get i
      
      The use of Vector types ensures type safety and eliminates the need for
      size compatibility checks at runtime. All vectors must have the same length
      by construction. -/
