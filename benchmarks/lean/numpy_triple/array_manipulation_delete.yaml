  /-  numpy.delete: Return a new array with sub-arrays along an axis deleted.
  
      For a one dimensional array, this returns those entries not returned by
      arr[obj]. The function removes elements at the specified index and
      returns a new array with the remaining elements.
  
      This specification handles the 1D case where we delete a single element
      at a specified index from a vector.

  /-  Specification: numpy.delete removes the element at the specified index and returns
      a new vector containing all other elements in their original order.
      
      The specification ensures:
      1. The result has size n (one less than the input)
      2. Elements before the deleted index maintain their positions
      3. Elements after the deleted index are shifted left by one position
      
      Mathematical properties:
      - Order preservation: Elements maintain their relative order
      - Deletion correctness: The element at the specified index is removed
      - Shift property: Elements after the deleted index have their indices decreased by 1
      
      Sanity checks:
      - The result size is exactly one less than the input size
      - No elements are duplicated or lost (except the deleted one)
      - The deleted element does not appear in the result
      
      Precondition: The array must have at least one element (enforced by type)
      
      Postcondition:
      - For indices i < index: result[i] = arr[i]
      - For indices i ≥ index: result[i] = arr[i+1]
      - The element arr[index] does not appear in the result (unless duplicated elsewhere)
