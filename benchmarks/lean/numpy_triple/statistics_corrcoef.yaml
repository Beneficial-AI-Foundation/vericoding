  /-  numpy.corrcoef: Return Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients.
  
      The correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two variables.
      For two vectors x and y, the correlation coefficient is computed as:
      
      corr(x, y) = cov(x, y) / (std(x) * std(y))
      
      Where:
      - cov(x, y) is the covariance between x and y
      - std(x) and std(y) are the standard deviations of x and y
      
      This function computes the correlation coefficient between two vectors of observations.
      The result is bounded between -1 and 1, where:
      - 1 indicates perfect positive correlation
      - -1 indicates perfect negative correlation  
      - 0 indicates no linear correlation
      
      Requires non-empty vectors and non-zero variance in both variables.

  /-  Specification: corrcoef computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between two vectors.
  
      The correlation coefficient satisfies several mathematical properties:
      1. Symmetry: corr(x, y) = corr(y, x)
      2. Bounded: -1 ≤ corr(x, y) ≤ 1
      3. Self-correlation: corr(x, x) = 1 (if x has non-zero variance)
      4. Scale invariance: correlation is preserved under linear transformations
      
      Precondition: Both vectors have non-zero variance (not all elements equal)
      Postcondition: Result is bounded between -1 and 1, and captures linear relationship
