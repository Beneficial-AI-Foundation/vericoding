  /-  Multiply a polynomial by x.
      Multiplies polynomial c by x, where x is the independent variable.
      For polynomial p(x) = c[0] + c[1]*x + ... + c[n-1]*x^(n-1),
      returns x*p(x) = 0 + c[0]*x + c[1]*x^2 + ... + c[n-1]*x^n -/

  /-  Specification: polymulx multiplies a polynomial by x.
      The result has one more coefficient than the input.
      The first coefficient is always 0, and subsequent coefficients
      are the original coefficients shifted by one position.
      This represents multiplying p(x) by x to get x*p(x). -/
