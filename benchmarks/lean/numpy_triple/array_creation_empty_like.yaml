  /-  numpy.empty_like: Return a new array with the same shape and type as a given array.
  
      Creates a new array with the same shape and type as the prototype array,
      but with uninitialized (arbitrary) data. This is useful for creating
      arrays that will be filled with values later, avoiding the overhead
      of initialization.
  
      The returned array has the same dimensions as the prototype but does not
      copy the values - the contents are undefined and may contain any values.
  -/
  
  /-  Specification: numpy.empty_like returns a vector with the same size as the prototype
      but with uninitialized values.
  
      Precondition: True (no special preconditions needed)
      Postcondition: 
      1. The result has the same size as the prototype array
      2. The result vector is well-formed with proper indexing
      3. The result is independent of the prototype's values (shape invariant)
      
      Mathematical Properties:
      - Size preservation: |result| = |prototype| = n
      - Index validity: all valid indices for prototype are valid for result
      - Type preservation: result has same element type as prototype
      
      Note: We cannot specify the actual values since they are uninitialized,
      but we can specify structural and size properties that must hold.
