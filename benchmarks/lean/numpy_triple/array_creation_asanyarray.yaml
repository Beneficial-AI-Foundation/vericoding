  /-  numpy.asanyarray: Convert the input to an ndarray, but pass ndarray subclasses through.
  
      Converts the input to an ndarray, but passes ndarray subclasses through unchanged.
      If the input is already an ndarray or a subclass of ndarray, it is returned as-is
      and no copy is performed. For other array-like inputs, it performs conversion.
  
      In this Vector-based specification, we model this as an identity function that
      preserves the input vector unchanged, representing the common case where the
      input is already an ndarray.

  /-  Specification: numpy.asanyarray returns the input vector unchanged when it's already an ndarray.
  
      Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
      Postcondition: The result is identical to the input vector - no copy is made,
                     and each element remains unchanged.
  
      This captures the key property of asanyarray: when given an ndarray (Vector in our case),
      it returns the same array without copying.
