  /-  numpy.log: Natural logarithm, element-wise.
      
      The natural logarithm log is the inverse of the exponential function,
      so that log(exp(x)) = x. The natural logarithm is logarithm base e.
      
      Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the natural logarithm
      of each element in x.
      
      Note: The domain of the natural logarithm is the positive real numbers.
      Mathematically, log(x) is undefined for x ≤ 0.
  -/

  /-  Specification: log returns a vector where each element is the natural
      logarithm of the corresponding element in x.
      
      Precondition: All elements must be positive (x[i] > 0)
      Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = log(x[i])
      
      Mathematical properties:
      - log is the inverse of exp: log(exp(x)) = x
      - log(1) = 0
      - log(e) = 1
      - log(x*y) = log(x) + log(y) for positive x, y
      - log is strictly increasing on (0, ∞)
