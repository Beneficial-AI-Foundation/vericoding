  /-  Multiply one Chebyshev series by another.
      
      Returns the product of two Chebyshev series c1 * c2. The arguments
      are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order term to highest,
      e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2.
      
      The result length is m + n - 1 where m and n are the lengths of c1 and c2. -/

  /-  Specification: chebmul computes the product of two Chebyshev series.
      
      The multiplication of Chebyshev polynomials follows the recurrence relation:
      T_m * T_n = (T_{m+n} + T_{|m-n|}) / 2
      
      This specification captures:
      1. The result has the correct length (m + n - 1)
      2. Mathematical properties of the resulting coefficients
      3. Example verification: multiplying T_0 with any polynomial preserves coefficients
      4. Symmetry: chebmul c1 c2 = chebmul c2 c1
      5. Example from documentation: [1,2,3] * [3,2,1] = [6.5, 12, 12, 4, 1.5] -/
