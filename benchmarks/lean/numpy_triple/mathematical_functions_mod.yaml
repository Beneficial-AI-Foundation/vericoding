  /-  numpy.mod: Returns the element-wise remainder of division.
  
      Computes the remainder complementary to the floor_divide function.
      This is equivalent to x1 % x2 in terms of array broadcasting.
      
      The result has the same sign as the divisor x2.
      For two arguments of floating point type, the result is:
      x1 - floor(x1/x2) * x2
  -/

  /-  Specification: numpy.mod returns a vector where each element is the remainder
      of the corresponding elements from x1 and x2.
  
      Precondition: All elements in x2 must be non-zero
      Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = x1[i] % x2[i]
      
      Mathematical properties:
      1. The result has the same sign as x2[i] (when x2[i] ≠ 0)
      2. The absolute value of result[i] is less than the absolute value of x2[i]
      3. x1[i] = floor(x1[i] / x2[i]) * x2[i] + result[i]
