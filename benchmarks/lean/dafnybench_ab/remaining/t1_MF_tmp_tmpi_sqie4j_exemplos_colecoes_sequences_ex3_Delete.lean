Delete removes p characters from position at in an array of characters.

Parameters:
- line: Array of characters to modify
- l: Natural number representing valid length of line
- at: Starting position for deletion
- p: Number of characters to delete

Requirements:
- l must not exceed line length
- at + p must not exceed l

Ensures:
- Characters before position 'at' remain unchanged
- Characters after deletion are shifted left

Specification for Delete operation
-/
theorem Delete_spec (line : Array Char) (l at p : Nat) :
  l ≤ line.size →
  at + p ≤ l →
  let result := Delete line l at p
  -- Note: Complex array slicing operations simplified to basic size properties
  result.size = line.size ∧
  ∀ i, i < at → result.get ⟨i⟩ = line.get ⟨i⟩ := sorry
