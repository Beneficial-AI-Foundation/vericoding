vc-description: |-
  A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.
  The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.
  Return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.
   
  Example 1:

  Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1
  Output: 1
  Explanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.
   
  Example 2:

  Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2
  Output: 3
  Explanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.

   
  Example 3:

  Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 3
  Output: 4
  Explanation: Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4.

   
  Constraints:

  1 <= n <= 10^4
  distance.length == n
  0 <= start, destination < n
  0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4
