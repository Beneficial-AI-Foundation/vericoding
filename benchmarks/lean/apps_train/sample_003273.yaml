vc-description: |-
  Due to another of his misbehaved, 
  the primary school's teacher of the young Gauß,  Herr J.G. Büttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates,
  assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number `n`.

  Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

  Here's, an example:

  ```
  f(n=100) // returns 5050 
  ```

  It's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, please, return false (None for Python, null for C#).

  > **Note:** the goal of this kata is to invite you to think about some 'basic' mathematic formula and how you can do performance optimization on your code. 

  > Advanced - experienced users should try to solve it in one line, without loops, or optimizing the code as much as they can.

  -----

  **Credits:** this kata was inspired by the farzher's kata 'Sum of large ints' . In fact, it can be seen as a sort of prep kata for that one.
