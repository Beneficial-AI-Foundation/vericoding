vc-description: |-
  Given a time in AM/PM format as a string, convert it to military (24-hour) time as a string.
  
  Midnight is 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock, and 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock. Noon is 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock, and 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock
  
  Sample Input: 07:05:45PM
  Sample Output: 19:05:45
  
  Try not to use built in DateTime libraries.
