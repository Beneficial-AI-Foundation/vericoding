  A family of kookaburras are in my backyard.
  
  I can't see them all, but I can hear them!
  
  # How many kookaburras are there?
  
  ## Hint 
  
  The trick to counting kookaburras is to listen carefully
  
  * The males go ```HaHaHa```...
  
  * The females go ```hahaha```...
  
  * And they always alternate male/female
