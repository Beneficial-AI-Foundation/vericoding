  In Spanish, the conjugated verb changes by adding suffixes and according to the person we're talking about. There's something similar in English when we talk about "She", "He"or "It" (3rd person singular):
  
  With the verb "run":
  
  **He / She / It runS**
  
  As you can see, the rule (at least with regular verbs) is to add the suffix  "-s" in the 3rd person singular. In Spanish it works the same way but we need to remove the **infinitive suffix** and add a specific suffix to all the others persons (I, You, He/She/It, We, You, They).
  
  Verbs in Spanish and the infinitive suffix.

  In Spanish we assume a verb is on its infitive form when it has one of the infinitives suffixes (**AR**, **ER** or **IR**) at the end:
  
  - Com**er** -> to eat
  
  - Camin**ar** -> to walk
  
  - Viv**ir** -> to live
  
  ## How to conjugate
  
  For conjugating in Spanish, we need to remove the infinitive suffix (**ar**, **er** *or* **ir**) and add the personal suffixes corresponding to the person we're talking to. In this kata we'll conjugate the verbs to its **presente indicativo** (simple present) form.
  
  Personal suffixes
  --
  The personal suffixes changes depending of the **Infinitive suffix**.
  
  If the infinitive suffix is **AR** the personal suffixes are:
  
  - first person singular (Yo / I): -**o**
  - second person singular (Tú / You): -**as**
  - third person singular (Él, Ella / He, She): -**a**
  - first person plural (Nosotros / We): -**amos**
  - second person plural (Vosotros / You): -**áis**
  - third person plural (Ellos / They): -**an**
  
  If the infinitive suffix is **ER**:
  - first person singular (Yo / I): -**o**
  - second person singular (Tú / You): -**es**
  - third person singular (Él, Ella / He, She): -**e**
  - first person plural (Nosotros / We): -**emos**
  - second person plural (Vosotros / You): -**éis**
  - third person plural (Ellos / They): -**en**
  
  If the infinitive suffix is **IR**:
  - first person singular (Yo / I): -**o**
  - second person singular (Tú / You): -**es**
  - third person singular (Él, Ella / He, She): -**e**
  - first person plural (Nosotros / We): -**imos**
  - second person plural (Vosotros / You): -**ís**
  - third person plural (Ellos / They): -**en**
  
  ## Conjugating 
  Steps for conjugating:
  1. Remove the infinitive suffix (ar, er, ir)
  2. And add the personal suffixes
  - Example: verb **Caminar** (to walk)
    - Camin**o** (I walk)
    - Camin**as** (You walk)
    - Camin**a** (He walks)
    - Camin**amos** (We walk)
    - Camin**áis** (You guys walk)
    - Camin**an** (They walk)
  - Example: verb **Comer** (to eat):
    - Com**o** (I eat)
    - Com**es** (You eat)
    - Com**e** (He, She eats)
    - Com**emos** (We eat)
    - Com**éis** (You guys eat)
    - Com**en** (They eat)
  - Example: verb **Vivir** (to live):
    - Viv**o** (I live)
    - Viv**es** (You live)
    - Viv**e** (He, She lives)
    - Viv**imos** (We live)
    - Viv**ís** (You guys live)
    - Viv**en** (They live)
  
  ## Your Task
  
  You need to write a function called **conjugate** which will return an object with a spanish verb conjugated. The object must look like this:
  
  ```
  {
    "comer": [
      "como",
      "comes",
      "come",
      "comemos",
      "coméis",
      "comen"
    ]
  }
  
  ```
  
  Where the key is the verb in its original form (infinitive form) and its value will be an array with the conjugations.
  
  Another example:
  ```
  {
    "vivir": [
      "vivo",
      "vives",
      "vive",
      "vivimos",
      "vivís",
      "viven"
    ]
  }
  
  ```
  
  ## Notes:
  1. The conjugations must be in this order:
  ```
  {
      verb: [
        "first person singular",
        "second person singular",
        "third person singular",
        "first person plural",
        "second person plural",
        "third person plural"
      ]
  }
  ```
  2.Don't use `JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)` because the "presentation" of the object isn't important.
  
  3.Don't use accents in Python version
  
   **Buena suerte!**
