You will be given a vector of strings. You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive, and based on the ASCII values of the chars) and then return the first value.

The returned value must be a string, and have `"***"` between each of its letters.

You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.

def two_sort (strings : List String) : String := sorry

def countSubstring (haystack : String) (needle : String) : Nat := sorry
