Write a function that reverses the bits in an integer.

For example, the number `417` is `110100001` in binary. Reversing the binary is `100001011` which is `267`.

You can assume that the number is not negative.

def reverse_bits (n : Nat) : Nat := sorry

-- Result is non-negative (trivial in Lean since Nat is used)
