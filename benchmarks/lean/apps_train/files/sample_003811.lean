Make multiple functions that will return the sum, difference, modulus, product, quotient, and the exponent respectively.

Please use the following function names:

addition = **add**

multiply = **multiply**

division = **divide** (both integer and float divisions are accepted)

modulus = **mod**

exponential = **exponent**

subtraction = **subt**

*Note: All math operations will be:
a (operation) b*

def add (a b : Int) : Int := sorry
def multiply (a b : Int) : Int := sorry

def divide (a b : Int) : Int := sorry 
def mod (a b : Int) : Int := sorry
