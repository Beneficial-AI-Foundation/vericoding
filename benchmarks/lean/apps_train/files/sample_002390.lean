Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true

Note:
You may assume both s and t have the same length.
