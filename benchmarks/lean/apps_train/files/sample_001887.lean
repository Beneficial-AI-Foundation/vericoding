Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. 

The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.

Example 1:

Input: "123"
Output: "121"

Note:

The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.
If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.
