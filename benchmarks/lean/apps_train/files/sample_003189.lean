# Kata Task

Given a list of random integers, return the Three Amigos.

These are 3 numbers that live next to each other in the list, and who have the **most** in common with each other by these rules:
* lowest statistical range
* same parity

# Notes

* The list will contain at least 3 numbers
* If there is more than one answer then return the first one found (reading the list left to right)
* If there is no answer (e.g. no 3 adjacent numbers with same parity) then return an empty list.

# Examples

* ex1
 * Input = ```[1, 2, 34, 2, 1, 5, 3, 5, 7, 234, 2, 1]```
 * Result = ```[5,3,5]```

* ex2
 * Input = ```[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3]```
 * Result = ```[2,2,2]```

* ex3
 * Input = ```[2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 3, 1, 56, 7, 6, 3, 12]```
 * Result = ```[]```
