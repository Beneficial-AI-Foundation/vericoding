One suggestion to build a satisfactory password is to start with a memorable phrase or sentence and make a password by extracting the first letter of each word. 

Even better is to replace some of those letters with numbers (e.g., the letter `O` can be replaced with the number `0`):

* instead of including `i` or `I` put the number `1` in the password;
* instead of including `o` or `O` put the number `0` in the password;
* instead of including `s` or `S` put the number `5` in the password.

## Examples:
```
"Give me liberty or give me death"  --> "Gml0gmd"
"Keep Calm and Carry On"            --> "KCaC0"
```

def SWAP : Char â†’ Char
  | 'a' => '@'
  | 'i' => '1'
  | 'e' => '3'
  | 'o' => '0'
  | c => c
