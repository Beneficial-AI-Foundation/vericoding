Given an array (ints) of n integers, find three integers in arr such that the sum is closest to a given number (num), target.

Return the sum of the three integers. 
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:

Note: your solution should not modify the input array.

def abs (x : Int) : Int :=
  if x â‰¥ 0 then x else -x
