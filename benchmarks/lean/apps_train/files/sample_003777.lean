In your class, you have started lessons about "arithmetic progression". Because you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function.

This function, arithmetic_sequence_sum(a, r, n), should return the sum of the first (n) elements of a sequence in which each element is the sum of the given integer (a), and a number of occurences of the given integer (r), based on the element's position within the sequence.

For example:

arithmetic_sequence_sum(2, 3, 5) should return 40:

```
1     2        3          4            5
a + (a+r) + (a+r+r) + (a+r+r+r) + (a+r+r+r+r) 
2 + (2+3) + (2+3+3) + (2+3+3+3) + (2+3+3+3+3) = 40
```
