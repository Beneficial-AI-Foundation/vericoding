Write a function that takes a string which has integers inside it separated by spaces, and your task is to convert each integer in the string into an integer and return their sum.

### Example
```python
summy("1 2 3")  ==> 6
```

Good luck!

def summy (s : String) : Int := sorry

def sum (l : List Int) : Int := sorry
