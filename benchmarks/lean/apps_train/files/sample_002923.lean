In this Kata, you will be given directions and your task will be to find your way back. 
```Perl
solve(["Begin on Road A","Right on Road B","Right on Road C","Left on Road D"]) = ['Begin on Road D', 'Right on Road C', 'Left on Road B', 'Left on Road A']
solve(['Begin on Lua Pkwy', 'Right on Sixth Alley', 'Right on 1st Cr']) =  ['Begin on 1st Cr', 'Left on Sixth Alley', 'Left on Lua Pkwy']
```

More examples in test cases. 

Good luck!
