vc-description: |-
  Takahashi has an ability to generate a tree using a permutation (p_1,p_2,...,p_n) of (1,2,...,n), in the following process:
  First, prepare Vertex 1, Vertex 2, ..., Vertex N.
  For each i=1,2,...,n, perform the following operation:
   - If p_i = 1, do nothing.
   - If p_i \neq 1, let j' be the largest j such that p_j < p_i. Span an edge between Vertex i and Vertex j'.
  Takahashi is trying to make his favorite tree with this ability.
  His favorite tree has n vertices from Vertex 1 through Vertex n, and its i-th edge connects Vertex v_i and w_i.
  Determine if he can make a tree isomorphic to his favorite tree by using a proper permutation.
  If he can do so, find the lexicographically smallest such permutation.

  -----Notes-----
  For the definition of isomorphism of trees, see wikipedia. Intuitively, two trees are isomorphic when they are the "same" if we disregard the indices of their vertices.

  -----Constraints-----
   - 2 \leq n \leq 10^5
   - 1 \leq v_i, w_i \leq n
   - The given graph is a tree.

  -----Input-----
  Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
  n
  v_1 w_1
  v_2 w_2
  :
  v_{n-1} w_{n-1}

  -----Output-----
  If there is no permutation that can generate a tree isomorphic to Takahashi's favorite tree, print -1.
  If it exists, print the lexicographically smallest such permutation, with spaces in between.

  -----Sample Input-----
  6
  1 2
  1 3
  1 4
  1 5
  5 6

  -----Sample Output-----
  1 2 4 5 3 6

  If the permutation (1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6) is used to generate a tree, it looks as follows:

  This is isomorphic to the given graph.
