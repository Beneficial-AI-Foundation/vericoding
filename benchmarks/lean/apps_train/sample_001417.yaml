vc-description: |-
  Ms. E.T. came from planet Hex. She has 8 fingers in each hand which makes her count in hexadecimal way. When she meets you, she tells you that she came from 7E light years from the planet Earth. You see she means that it is 126 light years far away and she is telling you the numbers in hexadecimal. Now, you are in trouble to understand what those numbers really mean. Therefore, you have to convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimals.
  
  Input:
  
  First line of code contain T test cases.
  
  every line of text case contain a Hex-value 
  
  Output:
  
  Every line of output contain a decimal conversion of given nunmber
  
  Sample Input:
  
  3
  
  A
  
  1A23
  
  2C2A
  
  Sample Output:
  
  10
  
  6691
  
  11306
