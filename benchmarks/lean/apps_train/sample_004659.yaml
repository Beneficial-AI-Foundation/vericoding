vc-description: |-
  The goal of this kata is to write a function that takes two inputs: a string and a character. The function will count the number of times that character appears in the string. The count is case insensitive.
  
  For example: 
  
  ```python
  count_char("fizzbuzz","z") => 4
  count_char("Fancy fifth fly aloof","f") => 5
  ```
  
  The character can be any alphanumeric character. 
  
  Good luck.
