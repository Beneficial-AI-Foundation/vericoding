vc-description: |-
  There are $X$ people participating in a quiz competition and their IDs have been numbered from $1$ to $X$ (both inclusive). Beth needs to form a team among these $X$ participants. She has been given an integer $Y$. She can choose participants whose ID numbers are divisible by $Y$. 
  Now that the team is formed, Beth wants to know the strength of her team. The strength of a team is the sum of all the last digits of the team members’ ID numbers.
  Can you help Beth in finding the strength of her team?
  
  -----Input:-----
  - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. $T$ lines follow 
  - The first line of each test case contains $X$ and $Y$. 
  
  -----Output:-----
  - For each test case print the strength of Beth's team
  
  -----Constraints-----
  - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
  - $1 \leq X,Y \leq 10^{20}$
  
  -----Sample Input:-----
  2
  10 3
  
  15 5
  
  -----Sample Output:-----
  18 
  
  10
  
  -----EXPLANATION:-----
  - Example case 1: ID numbers divisible by 3 are 3,6,9 and the sum of the last digits are 3+6+9=18
