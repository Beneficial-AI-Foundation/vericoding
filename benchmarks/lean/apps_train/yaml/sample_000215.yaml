  We are given hours, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.
  A day is considered to be a tiring day if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than 8.
  A well-performing interval is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.
  Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.
  
  Example 1:
  Input: hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]
  Output: 3
  Explanation: The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6].
  
  Constraints:
  
  1 <= hours.length <= 10000
  0 <= hours[i] <= 16
