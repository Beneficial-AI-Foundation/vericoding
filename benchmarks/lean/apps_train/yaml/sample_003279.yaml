  # Definition
  
  **_Disarium number_** is the number that *The sum of its digits powered with their respective positions is equal to the number itself*.
  
  ____
  
  # Task
  
  **_Given_** a number, **_Find if it is Disarium or not_** . 
  ____
  
  # Warm-up (Highly recommended)
  
  # [Playing With Numbers Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-numbers)
  ___
  
  # Notes 
  
  * **_Number_** *passed is always*  **_Positive_** .
  * **_Return_** *the result as* **_String_**
  ___
  
  # Input >> Output Examples
  
  ```
  disariumNumber(89) ==> return "Disarium !!"
  ```
  ## **_Explanation_**:
  
  * Since , **_8^(1) + 9^(2) = 89_** , thus *output* is `"Disarium !!"`
  ___
  
  ```
  disariumNumber(564) ==> return "Not !!"
  ```
  ## **_Explanation_**:
  
  Since , **_5^(1) + 6^(2) + 4^(3) = 105 != 564_** ,  thus *output* is `"Not !!"`
