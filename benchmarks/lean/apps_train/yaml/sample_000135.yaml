vc-description: |-
  Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:
  
  Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.
  Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.
  
  Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.
  
  Example 1:
  Input: n = 0
  Output: 0
  
  Example 2:
  Input: n = 3
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
  "11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
  "01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.
  
  Example 3:
  Input: n = 6
  Output: 4
  Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
  "110" -> "010" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.
  "010" -> "011" with the 1st operation.
  "011" -> "001" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
  "001" -> "000" with the 1st operation.
  
  Example 4:
  Input: n = 9
  Output: 14
  
  Example 5:
  Input: n = 333
  Output: 393
  
  Constraints:
  
  0 <= n <= 109
