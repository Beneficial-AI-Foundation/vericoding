  A sequence is usually a set or an array of numbers that has a strict way for moving from the nth term to the (n+1)th term.
  If ``f(n) = f(n-1) + c`` where ``c`` is a constant value, then ``f`` is an arithmetic sequence.
  An example would be (where the first term is 0 and the constant is 1) is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... and so on] )
  Else if (pun) ``f(n) = f(n-1) * c`` where ``c`` is a constant value, then ``f`` is a geometric sequence.
  Example where the first term is 2 and  the constant is 2 will be [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ... to infinity ... ]
  There are some sequences that aren't arithmetic nor are they geometric.
  Here is a link to feed your brain : Sequence !
  
  You're going to write a function that's going to return the value in the nth index of an arithmetic sequence.(That is, adding a constant to move to the next element in the "set").
  
  The function's name is `nthterm`/`Nthterm`, it takes three inputs `first`,`n`,`c` where:
  
    - ``first`` is the first value in the 0 INDEX.
    - ``n`` is the index of the value we want.
    - ``c`` is the constant added between the terms.
  
  Remember that `first` is in the index ``0`` .. just saying ...
