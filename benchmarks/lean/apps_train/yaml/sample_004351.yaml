vc-description: |-
  You are given two sorted arrays that contain only integers. Your task is to find a way to merge them into a single one, sorted in **ascending order**. Complete the function `mergeArrays(arr1, arr2)`, where `arr1` and `arr2` are the original sorted arrays.
  
  You don't need to worry about validation, since `arr1` and `arr2` must be arrays with 0 or more Integers. If both `arr1` and `arr2` are empty, then just return an empty array.
  
  **Note:** `arr1` and `arr2` may be sorted in different orders. Also `arr1` and `arr2` may have same integers. Remove duplicated in the returned result.
  
  ## Examples
  
  Happy coding!
