vc-description: |-
  The chef is placing the laddus on the large square plat. The plat has the side of length N. Each laddu takes unit sq.unit area. Cheffina comes and asks the chef one puzzle to the chef as, how many squares can be formed in this pattern with all sides of new square are parallel to the original edges of the plate.
  
  -----Input:-----
  - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
  - Each test case contains a single line of input, one integer $N$. 
  
  -----Output:-----
  For each test case, output in a single line answer as maximum squares on plate satisfying the condition.
  
  -----Constraints-----
  - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
  - $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
  
  -----Sample Input:-----
  2
  1
  2 
  
  -----Sample Output:-----
  1
  5
  
  -----EXPLANATION:-----
  For 1) Only 1 Square
  For 2) 4 squares with area 1 sq.unit
  1 square with area 4 sq.unit
