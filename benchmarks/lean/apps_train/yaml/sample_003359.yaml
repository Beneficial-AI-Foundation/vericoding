  This is related to my other Kata about cats and dogs.
  
  # Kata Task
  
  I have a cat and a dog which I got as kitten / puppy.
  
  I forget when that was, but I do know their current ages as `catYears` and `dogYears`.
  
  Find how long I have owned each of my pets and return as a list [`ownedCat`, `ownedDog`]
  
  NOTES:
  * Results are truncated whole numbers of "human" years
  
  ## Cat Years
  
  * `15` cat years for first year
  * `+9` cat years for second year
  * `+4` cat years for each year after that
  
  ## Dog Years
  
  * `15` dog years for first year
  * `+9` dog years for second year
  * `+5` dog years for each year after that
