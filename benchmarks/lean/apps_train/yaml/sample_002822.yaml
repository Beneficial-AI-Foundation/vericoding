vc-description: |-
  Given a string of words and numbers. Extract the expression including: 
  1. the operator: either addition or subtraction
  2. the two numbers that we are operating on
  
  Return the result of the calculation.
  
  Example:
  
  "Panda has 48 apples and loses 4" returns 44
  
  "Jerry has 34 apples and gains 6" returns 40
  
  "loses" and "gains" are the only two words describing operators.
  
  Should be a nice little kata for you :)
  
  Note:
  No fruit debts nor bitten apples = The numbers are integers and no negatives
