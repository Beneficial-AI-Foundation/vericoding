vc-description: |-
  2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
  Task:
  Write
  ```
  smallest(n)
  ```
  that will find the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to n (n <= 40). 
  E.g
  ```python
  smallest(5) == 60 # 1 to 5 can all divide evenly into 60
  smallest(10) == 2520
  ```
