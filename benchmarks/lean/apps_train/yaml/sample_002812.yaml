  # A History Lesson
  
  The Pony Express was a mail service operating in the US in 1859-60.
  
  It reduced the time for messages to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to about 10 days, before it was made obsolete by the [transcontinental telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_telegraph).
  
  # How it worked
  
  There were a number of *stations*, where:
  
  * The rider switched to a fresh horse and carried on, or
  * The mail bag was handed over to the next rider
  
  # Kata Task
  
  `stations` is a list/array of distances (miles) from one station to the next along the Pony Express route.
  
  Implement the `riders` method/function, to return how many riders are necessary to get the mail from one end to the other.
  
  **NOTE:** Each rider travels as far as he can, but never more than 100 miles.
