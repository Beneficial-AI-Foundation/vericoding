vc-description: |-
  An array is **circularly sorted** if the elements are sorted in ascending order, but displaced, or rotated, by any number of steps. 
  
  Complete the function/method that determines if the given array of integers is circularly sorted.
  
  ## Examples
  
  These arrays are circularly sorted (`true`):
  ```
  [2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1]       -->  [0, 1] + [2, 3, 4, 5]
  [4, 5, 6, 9, 1]          -->  [1] + [4, 5, 6, 9]
  [10, 11, 6, 7, 9]        -->  [6, 7, 9] + [10, 11]
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]          -->  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  [5, 7, 43, 987, -9, 0]   -->  [-9, 0] + [5, 7, 43, 987]
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 1]          -->  [1] + [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```
  
  While these are not (`false`):
  ```
  [4, 1, 2, 5]
  [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3]
  [6, 7, 4, 8]
  [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
  ```
