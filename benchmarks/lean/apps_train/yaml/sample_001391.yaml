vc-description: |-
  Chef is baking a cake.
  
  While baking, in each minute the size of cake doubles as compared to its previous size.
  
  In this cake, baking of cake is directly proportional to its size.
  You are given $a$, the total time taken(in minutes) to bake the whole cake.
  
  Let cake be half baked at $k^{th}$ minute.         
  Your task is to find the value of $k+2$.
  
  -----Input:-----
  - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.               
  - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $a$.
  
  -----Output:-----
  For each testcase , print one line, the value of $k+2$.
  
  -----Constraints-----
  - $1 \leq T \leq 8 $
  - $2 \leq a \leq 10^{128}$
  
  -----Sample Input:-----
  1
  
  2
  
  -----Sample Output:-----
  3
  
  -----Explaination-----
  Time was 1 min when cake was half baked by chef so answer is 1+2=3
