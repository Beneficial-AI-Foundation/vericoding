vc-description: |-
  In your class, you have started lessons about geometric progression.
  Since you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function that will print first `n` elements of the sequence with the given constant `r` and first element `a`.
  
  Result should be separated by comma and space.
  
  ### Example
  
  ```python
  geometric_sequence_elements(2, 3, 5) == '2, 6, 18, 54, 162'
  ```
