  Task
  =======
  
  Make a custom esolang interpreter for the language Tick. Tick is a descendant of [Ticker](https://www.codewars.com/kata/esolang-ticker) but also very different data and command-wise.
  
  Syntax/Info
  ========
  
  Commands are given in character format. Non-command characters should be ignored. Tick has an potentially infinite memory as opposed to Ticker(which you have a special command to add a new cell) and only has 4 commands(as opposed to 7). Read about this esolang [here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Tick).
  
  Commands
  ========
  
  `>`: Move data selector right
  
  `<`: Move data selector left(infinite in both directions)
  
  `+`: Increment memory cell by 1. 255+1=0
  
  `*`: Add ascii value of memory cell to the output tape.
  
  Examples
  ========
  
  **Hello world!**
  
  ```
  '++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++**>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*<<*>>>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*<<<<*>>>>>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*'
  ```
