vc-description: |-
  Find the volume of a cone whose radius and height are provided as parameters to the function `volume`. Use the value of PI provided by your language (for example: `Math.PI` in JS, `math.pi` in Python or `Math::PI` in Ruby) and round down the volume to an Interger.
  
  If you complete this kata and there are no issues, please remember to give it a ready vote and a difficulty rating. :)
