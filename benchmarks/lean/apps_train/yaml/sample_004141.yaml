vc-description: |-
  Fast & Furious Driving School's (F&F) charges for lessons are as below: 
  
  Time
  Cost
  
  Up to 1st hour
  $30
  
  Every subsequent half hour**
  $10
  
  ** Subsequent charges are calculated by rounding up to nearest half hour.
  
  For example, if student X has a lesson for 1hr 20 minutes, he will be charged $40 (30+10) for 1 hr 30 mins and if he has a lesson for 5 minutes, he will be charged $30 for the full hour. 
  
  Out of the kindness of its heart, F&F also provides a 5 minutes grace period. So, if student X were to have a lesson for 65 minutes or 1 hr 35 mins, he will only have to pay for an hour or 1hr 30 minutes respectively. 
  
  For a given lesson time in minutes (min) , write a function price to calculate how much the lesson costs.
