vc-description: |-
  Consider the number `1176` and its square (`1176 * 1176) = 1382976`. Notice that:
  
  * the first two digits of `1176` form a prime.
  * the first two digits of the square `1382976` also form a prime.
  * the last two digits of `1176` and `1382976` are the same. 
  
  Given two numbers representing a range (`a, b`), how many numbers satisfy this property within that range? (`a <= n < b`)
  
  ## Example
  
  `solve(2, 1200) = 1`, because only `1176` satisfies this property within the range `2 <= n < 1200`. See test cases for more examples. The upper bound for the range will not exceed `1,000,000`. 
  
  Good luck!
