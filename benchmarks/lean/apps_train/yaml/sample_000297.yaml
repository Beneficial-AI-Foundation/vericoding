vc-description: |-
  Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and ages[i] is the age of the ith person. 
  Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:
  
  age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7
  age[B] > age[A]
  age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100
  
  Otherwise, A will friend request B.
  Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.
  How many total friend requests are made?
  Example 1:
  Input: [16,16]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
  
  Example 2:
  Input: [16,17,18]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
  Example 3:
  Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
  Output: 3
  Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.
  
  Notes:
  
  1 <= ages.length <= 20000.
  1 <= ages[i] <= 120.
