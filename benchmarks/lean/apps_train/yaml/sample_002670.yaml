vc-description: |-
  Positive integers have so many gorgeous features. 
  Some of them could be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive numbers.
  ___
  
  # Consider an Example :
  
  * `10` , could be expressed as a sum of `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 `.
  ___
  # Task
  
  **_Given_** *Positive integer*, N , **_Return_** true if it could be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive numbers , OtherWise return false .
  ___
  
  # Notes 
  
  ~~~if-not:clojure,csharp,java
  * Guaranteed constraint  :  **_2  ≤  N  ≤  (2^32) -1_** .
