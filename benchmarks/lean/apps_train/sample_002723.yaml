vc-description: |-
  For a given 2D vector described by cartesian coordinates of its initial point and terminal point in the following format:
  
  ```python
  [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]]
  ```
  
  Your function must return this vector's length represented as a floating point number.
  
  Error must be within 1e-7.
  
  Coordinates can be integers or floating point numbers.
