vc-description: |-
  Chef has a circular plot of land of radius $R$ on which he wants to construct a swimming pool.
  He wants the swimming pool to be square in shape with maximum possible area,so that he along
  with his friends can enjoy themselves during their summer vacations.
  Help Chef to find out the maximum area of the swimming pool that can be constructed in his 
  circular plot.
  
  -----Input:-----
  - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
  - Each testcase contains of a single line of input,  $R$ i.e the radius of the plot. 
  
  -----Output:-----
  For each testcase, output in a single line answer displaying the maximum possible area of the swimming pool.
  
  -----Constraints-----
  - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
  - $1 \leq R \leq 10^8$
  
  -----Sample Input:-----
  2
  
  5
  
  10   
  
  -----Sample Output:-----
  50
  
  200
