vc-description: |-
  John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He's heard that 
  making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds. 
  He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.

  John knows that the rectangular room has a length of `l` meters, a width of `w` meters, a height of `h` meters.
  The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is `52` centimeters. The 
  length of a roll is `10` meters.
  He bears in mind however, that it’s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length `15%` greater than the one he needs.

  Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John? Your function `wallpaper(l, w, h)` should return as a plain English word
  in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

  ### Example:

  `wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"`

  `wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"`

  # Notes:
  - all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge 
  - 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that `w x h x l` is zero
  - the integer `r` (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20


  - FORTH: the number of rolls will be a *positive or null integer* (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)
