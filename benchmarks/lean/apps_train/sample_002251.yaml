vc-description: |-
  Given positive integers N, K and M, solve the following problem for every integer x between 1 and N (inclusive):
   - Find the number, modulo M, of non-empty multisets containing between 0 and K (inclusive) instances of each of the integers 1, 2, 3 \cdots, N such that the average of the elements is x.

  -----Constraints-----
   - 1 \leq N, K \leq 100
   - 10^8 \leq M \leq 10^9 + 9
   - M is prime.
   - All values in input are integers.

  -----Input-----
  Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
  N K M

  -----Output-----
  Use the following format:
  c_1
  c_2
  :
  c_N

  Here, c_x should be the number, modulo M, of multisets such that the average of the elements is x.

  -----Sample Input-----
  3 1 998244353

  -----Sample Output-----
  1
  3
  1

  Consider non-empty multisets containing between 0 and 1 instance(s) of each of the integers between 1 and 3. Among them, there are:
   - one multiset such that the average of the elements is k = 1: \{1\};
   - three multisets such that the average of the elements is k = 2: \{2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{1, 2, 3\};
   - one multiset such that the average of the elements is k = 3: \{3\}.
