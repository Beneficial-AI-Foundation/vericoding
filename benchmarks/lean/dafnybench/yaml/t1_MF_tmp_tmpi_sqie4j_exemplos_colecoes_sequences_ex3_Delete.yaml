  Delete removes p characters from position at in an array of characters.
  
  Parameters:
  - line: Array of characters to modify
  - l: Natural number representing valid length of line
  - at: Starting position for deletion
  - p: Number of characters to delete
  
  Requirements:
  - l must not exceed line length
  - at + p must not exceed l
  
  Ensures:
  - Characters before position 'at' remain unchanged
  - Characters after deletion are shifted left
