/--
Predicate that checks if array is sorted between given indices.
Translated from Dafny's sorted_between predicate.
-/
def sorted_between (A : Array Int) (_from : Int) (to : Int) : Prop :=
∀ i j, 0 ≤ i ∧ i ≤ j ∧ j < A.size ∧ _from ≤ i ∧ i ≤ j ∧ j ≤ to →
A[i]! ≤ A[j]!

/--
Predicate that checks if entire array is sorted.
Translated from Dafny's sorted predicate.
-/
def sorted (A : Array Int) : Prop :=
sorted_between A 0 (A.size - 1)

/--
BubbleSort implementation.
Translated from Dafny's BubbleSort method.

/--
Specification for BubbleSort.
Ensures array is sorted and contains same elements as input.

theorem BubbleSort_spec (A : Array Int) :
let result := BubbleSort A
sorted result ∧
-- Note: Simplified multiset preservation property since Lean doesn't have direct multiset support
result.size = A.size := sorry
