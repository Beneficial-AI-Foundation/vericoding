/--
Euclid's algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two positive integers.
Translated from Dafny specification.

@param m First integer input, must be greater than 1
@param n Second integer input, must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to m
@return The greatest common divisor of m and n

/--
Specification for Euclid's algorithm.
Ensures that:
1. The result is positive
2. The result divides both inputs
3. The result is less than or equal to both inputs
4. The first input is greater than or equal to the second

theorem Euclid_spec (m n : Int) :
m > 1 ∧ n > 1 ∧ m ≥ n →
let gcd := Euclid m n
gcd > 0 ∧ gcd ≤ n ∧ gcd ≤ m ∧ m % gcd = 0 ∧ n % gcd = 0 := sorry
