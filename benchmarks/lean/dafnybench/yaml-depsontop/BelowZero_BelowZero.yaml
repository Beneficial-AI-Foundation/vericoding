vc-description: |-
  Check if a sequence of operations causes the balance to go below zero.
Given a sequence of operations (deposits/withdrawals), computes the running
balance starting from 0 and returns whether the balance ever goes negative.
Specification from Dafny:
- s[0] = 0 (initial balance)
- s[i+1] = s[i] + operations[i] (running sum)
- result = true iff there exists an i where s[i] < 0
