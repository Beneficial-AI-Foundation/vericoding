  swap: Swap two elements in an array.
Takes an array and two indices i and j, and swaps the elements
at those positions. The array is modified in place.
Requires: 0 ≤ i < arr.size and 0 ≤ j < arr.size
Modifies the array so that:
- arr[i] becomes the old value of arr[j]
- arr[j] becomes the old value of arr[i]
- All other elements remain unchanged
