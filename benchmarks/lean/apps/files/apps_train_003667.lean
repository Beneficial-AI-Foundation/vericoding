Your back at your newly acquired decrypting job for the secret organization when a new assignment comes in.   Apparently the enemy has been communicating using a device they call "The Mirror".  
It is a rudimentary device with encrypts the message by switching its letter with its mirror opposite (A => Z), (B => Y), (C => X) etc.  

Your job is to build a method called "mirror" which will decrypt the messages. Resulting messages will be in lowercase.

To add more secrecy, you are to accept a second optional parameter, telling you which letters or characters are to be reversed; if it is not given, consider the whole alphabet as a default.

To make it a bit more clear: e.g. in case of "abcdefgh" as the second optional parameter, you replace "a" with "h", "b" with "g" etc. .

For example:
```python
mirror("Welcome home"), "dvoxlnv slnv" #whole alphabet mirrored here
mirror("hello", "abcdefgh"), "adllo" #notice only "h" and "e" get reversed
```
