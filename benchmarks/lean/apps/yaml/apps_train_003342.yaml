  # Introduction and Warm-up (Highly recommended)
  
  # [Playing With Lists/Arrays Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-lists-slash-arrays)
  ___
  
  # Task
  
  **_Given_** an *array/list [] of integers* , **_Find_** **_The maximum difference_** *between the successive elements in its sorted form*. 
  ___
  
  # Notes 
  
  * **_Array/list_** size is *at least 3*  .
  
  * **_Array/list's numbers_**  Will be **mixture of positives and negatives also zeros_**  
  
  * **_Repetition_** of numbers in *the array/list could occur*.
  
  * **_The Maximum Gap_** is *computed Regardless the sign*.
  
  ___
  
  # Input >> Output Examples 
  
  ```
  maxGap ({13,10,5,2,9}) ==> return (4)
  ```
  
  ## **_Explanation_**: 
  
  * **_The Maximum Gap_** *after sorting the array is* `4` , *The difference between*   ``` 9 - 5 = 4 ``` .
  ___
  
  ```
  maxGap ({-3,-27,-4,-2}) ==> return (23)
  ```
  ## **_Explanation_**: 
  
  * **_The Maximum Gap_** *after sorting the array is* `23` , *The difference between*   ` |-4- (-27) | = 23` .
  
  *  **_Note_** : *Regardless the sign of negativity* .
  ___
  
  ```
  maxGap ({-7,-42,-809,-14,-12}) ==> return (767)  
  ```
  ## **_Explanation_**: 
  
  * **_The Maximum Gap_** *after sorting the array is* `767` , *The difference between*   ` | -809- (-42) | = 767` .
  
  *  **_Note_** : *Regardless the sign of negativity* .
  ___
  
  ```
  maxGap ({-54,37,0,64,640,0,-15}) //return (576)
  ```
  ## **_Explanation_**: 
  
  * **_The Maximum Gap_** *after sorting the array is* `576` , *The difference between*   ` | 64 - 640 | = 576` .
  
  *  **_Note_** : *Regardless the sign of negativity* .
