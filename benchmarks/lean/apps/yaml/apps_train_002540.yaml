  Passer ratings are the generally accepted standard for evaluating NFL quarterbacks.
  I knew a rating of 100 is pretty good, but never knew what makes up the rating.
  So out of curiosity I took a look at the wikipedia page and had an idea or my first kata: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating
  
  ## Formula
  
  There are four parts to the NFL formula:
  ```python
  A = ((Completions / Attempts) - .3) * 5
  B = ((Yards / Attempts) - 3) * .25
  C = (Touchdowns / Attempt) * 20
  D = 2.375 - ((Interceptions / Attempts) * 25)
  ```
  However, if the result of any calculation is greater than `2.375`, it is set to `2.375`. If the result is a negative number, it is set to zero.
  
  Finally the passer rating is: `((A + B + C + D) / 6) * 100`
  
  Return the rating rounded to the nearest tenth.
  
  ## Example
  
  Last year Tom Brady had 432 attempts, 3554 yards, 291 completions, 28 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions.
  His passer rating was 112.2
  
  Happy coding!
