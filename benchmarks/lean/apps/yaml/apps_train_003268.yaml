  In genetics 2 differents DNAs sequences can code for the same protein. 
  
  This is due to the redundancy of the genetic code, in fact 2 different tri-nucleotide can code for the same amino-acid.
  For example the tri-nucleotide 'TTT' and the tri-nucleotide 'TTC' both code for the amino-acid 'F'. For more information you can take a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table).
  
  Your goal in this kata is to define if two differents DNAs sequences code for exactly the same protein. Your function take the 2 sequences you should compare.
  For some kind of simplicity here the sequences will respect the following rules:
  
  - It is a full protein sequence beginning with a Start codon and finishing by an Stop codon
  - It will only contain valid tri-nucleotide. 
  
  The translation hash is available for you under a translation hash `$codons` [Ruby] or `codons` [Python and JavaScript].
  
  To better understand this kata you can take a look at this [one](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5708ef48fe2d018413000776), it can help you to start.
