  # MOD 256 without the MOD operator
  
  The MOD-operator % (aka mod/modulus/remainder):
  ```
  Returns the remainder of a division operation.
  The sign of the result is the same as the sign of the first operand.
  (Different behavior in Python!)
  ```
  
  The short unbelievable mad story for this kata:
  I wrote a program and needed the remainder of the division by 256. And then it happened: The "5"/"%"-Key did not react. It must be broken! So I needed a way to:
  ```
  Calculate the remainder of the division by 256 without the %-operator.
  ```
  
  Also here some examples:
  ```
  Input 254  -> Result 254
  Input 256  -> Result 0
  Input 258  -> Result 2 
  Input -258 -> Result -2 (in Python: Result: 254!)
  ```
  It is always expected the behavior of the MOD-Operator of the language!
  
  The input number will always between -10000 and 10000.
  
  For some languages the %-operator will be blocked. If it is not blocked and you know how to block it, tell me and I will include it.
  
  For all, who say, this would be a duplicate: No, this is no duplicate! There are two katas, in that you have to write a general method for MOD without %. But this kata is only for MOD 256. And so you can create also other specialized solutions. ;-)
  
  Of course you can use the digit "5" in your solution. :-)
  
  I'm very curious for your solutions and the way you solve it. I found several interesting "funny" ways.
  
  Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) 
  
  I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!
