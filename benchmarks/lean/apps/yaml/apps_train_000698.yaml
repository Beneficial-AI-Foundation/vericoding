  -----Input:-----
  - First line will contain T$T$, number of test cases. 
  - Each test case contains two space separated integers B$B$ (Number of boys) and  G$G$ (Number of Girls).
  
  -----Output:-----
  For each test case, output in a single line the total number of roses exchanged.
  
  -----Constraints:-----
  - 1≤T≤105$1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
  - 1≤B≤109$1 \leq B \leq 10^{9}$
  - 1≤G≤109$1 \leq G \leq 10^{9}$
