  My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!
  
  In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!
  
  * Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.  
  * Multiply each number by itself.  
  * Add them all together.  
  * Take the square root of the result.  
  * Divide by two.
  
  ## Example
  
  ```R
  predict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86
  ```
  ```python
  predict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86
  ```
  
  Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.
  
  Some random tests might fail due to a bug in the JavaScript implementation. Simply resubmit if that happens to you.
