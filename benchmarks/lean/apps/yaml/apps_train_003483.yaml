  You're given a string of dominos. For each slot, there are 3 options:
  
    * "|" represents a standing domino
  
    * "/" represents a knocked over domino
  
    * " " represents a space where there is no domino
  
  For example: 
  
  ```python
  "||| ||||//| |/"
  ```
  
  What you must do is find the resulting string if the first domino is pushed over. Now, tipping a domino will cause the next domino to its right to fall over as well, but if a domino is already tipped over, or there is a domino missing, the reaction will stop.
  
  So in out example above, the result would be:
  
  "/// ||||//| |/"
  
  since the reaction would stop as soon as it gets to a space.
