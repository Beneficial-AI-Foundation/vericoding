  # Task
  `Triangular numbers` are defined by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2` with `n` starting from 1. They count the number of objects that can form an equilateral triangle as shown in the picture below:
  
  ![](https://i.gyazo.com/eec11cc9e17a31324338edc4eb7bb746.png)
  
  So the sequence of triangular numbers begins as follows:
  
  `1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ....`
  
  It is proven that the sum of squares of any two consecutive triangular numbers is equal to another triangular number.
  
  You're given a triangular number `n`. Return `true` if it can be represented as `a sum of squares of two consecutive triangular numbers`, or `false` otherwise.
  
  # Input/Output
  
  `[input]` integer `n`
  
  A positive triangular number
  
  `3 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`
  
  `[output]` a boolean value
  
  `true` if it is possible to represent n as the sum of squares of two consecutive triangular numbers, and `false` otherwise.
  
  # Example
  
  For `n = 6`, the output should be `false`.
  
  No two squared consecutive triangular numbers add up to 6.
  
  For `n = 45`, the output should be `true`.
  
  `3 * 3 + 6 * 6 = 9 + 36 = 45`
