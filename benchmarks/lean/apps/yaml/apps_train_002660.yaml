  The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).
  
  For example:
  
  ```python
  cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
  ```
  
  Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.
