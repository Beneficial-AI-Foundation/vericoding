  You have a collection of lovely poems. Unfortuantely they aren't formatted very well. They're all on one line, like this:
  
  ```
  Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated.
  ```
  What you want is to present each sentence on a new line, so that it looks like this:
  ```
  Beautiful is better than ugly.
  Explicit is better than implicit.
  Simple is better than complex.
  Complex is better than complicated.
  ```
  Write a function, `format_poem()` that takes a string like the one line example as an argument and returns a new string that is formatted across multiple lines with each new sentence starting on a new line when you print it out.
  
  Try to solve this challenge with the [str.split()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) and the [str.join()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join) string methods.
  
  Every sentence will end with a period, and every new sentence will have one space before the previous period. Be careful about trailing whitespace in your solution.
