  # Welcome to the Codewars Bar!
  
  Codewars Bar recommends you drink 1 glass of water per standard drink so you're not hungover tomorrow morning.
  
  Your fellow coders have bought you several drinks tonight in the form of a string. Return a string suggesting how many glasses of water you should drink to not be hungover.
  
  ## Examples
  
  ```
  "1 beer"  =>  "1 glass of water"
  "1 shot, 5 beers and 1 glass of wine"  =>  "7 glasses of water"
  ```
  
  ## Notes
  
  * To keep the things simple, we'll consider that anything with a number in front of it is a drink: `"1 bear" => "1 glass of water"` or `"1 chainsaw and 2 pools" => "3 glasses of water"`
  * The number in front of each drink lies in range `[1; 9]`
