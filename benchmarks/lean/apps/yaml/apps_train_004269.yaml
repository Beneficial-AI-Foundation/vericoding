  When you want to get the square of a binomial of two variables x and y, you will have:
  
  `$(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y ^2$`
  
  And the cube:
  
  `$(x+y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 +y^3$`
  
  It is known from many centuries ago that for an exponent n, the result of a binomial x + y raised to the n-th power is:
  
  Or using the sumation notation:
  
  Each coefficient of a term has the following value:
  
  Each coefficient value coincides with the amount of combinations without replacements of a set of n elements using only k different ones of that set.
  
  Let's see the total sum of the coefficients of the different powers for the binomial:
  
  `$(x+y)^0(1)$`
  
  `$(x+y)^1 = x+y(2)$`
  
  `$(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y ^2(4)$`
  
  `$(x+y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 +y^3(8)$`
  
  We need a function that may generate an array with the values of all the coefficients sums from 0 to the value of n included and has the addition of all the sum values as last element.
  
  We add some examples below:
  ``` 
  f(0) = [1, 1]
  f(1) = [1, 2, 3]
  f(2) = [1, 2, 4, 7]
  f(3) = [1, 2, 4, 8, 15]
  ``` 
  
  Features of the test
  ``` 
  Low Performance Tests
  Number of tests = 50
  9 < n < 101
  
  High Performance Tests
  Number of Tests = 50
  99 < n < 5001
  ```
