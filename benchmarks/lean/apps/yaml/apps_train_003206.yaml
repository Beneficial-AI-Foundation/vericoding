  You certainly can tell which is the larger number between 2^(10) and 2^(15).
  
  But what about, say, 2^(10) and 3^(10)? You know this one too.
  
  Things tend to get a bit more complicated with **both** different bases and exponents: which is larger between 3^(9) and 5^(6)?
  
  Well, by now you have surely guessed that you have to build a function to compare powers, returning -1 if the first member is larger, 0 if they are equal, 1 otherwise; powers to compare will be provided in the `[base, exponent]` format:
  ```python
  compare_powers([2,10],[2,15])==1
  compare_powers([2,10],[3,10])==1
  compare_powers([2,10],[2,10])==0
  compare_powers([3,9],[5,6])==-1
  compare_powers([7,7],[5,8])==-1
  ```
  ```if:nasm
  int compare_powers(const int n1[2], const int n2[2])
  ```
  Only positive integers will be tested, incluing bigger numbers - you are warned now, so be diligent try to implement an efficient solution not to drain too much on CW resources ;)!
