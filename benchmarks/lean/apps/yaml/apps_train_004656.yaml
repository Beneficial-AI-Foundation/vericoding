  ⚠️ The world is in quarantine! There is a new pandemia that struggles mankind. Each continent is isolated from each other but infected people have spread before the warning. ⚠️
  
  🗺️ You would be given a map of the world in a type of string:
  
      string s = "01000000X000X011X0X"
  
      '0' : uninfected
  
      '1' : infected
  
      'X' : ocean
  
  ⚫ The virus can't spread in the other side of the ocean.
  
  ⚫ If one person is infected every person in this continent gets infected too.
  
  ⚫ Your task is to find the percentage of human population that got infected in the end.
  
  ☑️ Return the percentage % of the total population that got infected.
  
  ❗❗ The first and the last continent are not connected!
  
  💡 Example:
  
       start: map1 = "01000000X000X011X0X"
       end:   map1 = "11111111X000X111X0X"
       total = 15
       infected = 11
       percentage = 100*11/15 = 73.33333333333333
  
  ➕ For maps without oceans "X" the whole world is connected.
  
  ➕ For maps without "0" and "1" return 0 as there is no population.
