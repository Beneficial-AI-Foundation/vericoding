/-- Specification: bitwise_and computes element-wise bitwise AND operation 
    
    This specification captures the mathematical properties of bitwise AND:
    - Commutativity: a & b = b & a
    - Associativity: (a & b) & c = a & (b & c)
    - Identity with all bits set: a & (-1) = a (but using max value for Nat)
    - Absorption with zero: a & 0 = 0
    - Idempotent: a & a = a
    - Monotonicity: if a ≤ b, then a & c ≤ b & c
