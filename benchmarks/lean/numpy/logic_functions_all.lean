/-- Test whether all array elements evaluate to True.
    Elements are considered True if they are non-zero.
    NaN, positive infinity and negative infinity evaluate to True. -/

  sorry

/-- Specification: all returns True if and only if all elements are non-zero.
    This includes proper handling of special float values:
    - NaN evaluates to True (it is not equal to zero)
    - Positive and negative infinity evaluate to True (they are not equal to zero)
    - Only 0.0 and -0.0 evaluate to False
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - Empty vector returns True (vacuous truth)
    - all is monotonic: if all(a) is True and b has same non-zero elements, then all(b) is True
    - all(a) = not(any(map(λx. x = 0, a))) - equivalent to checking no element is zero
    
    Sanity checks:
    - For empty vector (n = 0), the result is True by vacuous truth
    - For single element [x], result is True iff x ≠ 0
    - For vector with all non-zero elements, result is True
    - For vector with at least one zero element, result is False
    
    Additional properties:
    - Idempotent: all(all(a)) = all(a) (when treating Bool as numeric)
    - Distributive over logical AND: all(a) ∧ all(b) → all(pointwise_and(a, b))
    - Relationship to logical AND reduction: all(a) = fold(∧, true, map(≠ 0, a)) -/
