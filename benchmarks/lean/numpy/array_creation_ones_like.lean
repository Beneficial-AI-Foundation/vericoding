/-- Return a vector of ones with the same length as the input vector.
    This is the 1D version of numpy.ones_like which creates a new vector
    filled with ones, having the same size as the input vector. -/

/-- Specification: ones_like returns a vector where every element is 1,
    with the same length as the input vector.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. The result has the same length as the input (enforced by type system)
    2. Every element in the result is exactly 1
    3. The result is independent of the input values (only depends on shape) -/
