/-- Evaluate a 2-D Hermite series at points (x, y).
    
    Given a 2D coefficient matrix c where c[i,j] is the coefficient for H_i(x) * H_j(y),
    evaluates the sum: ∑_{i,j} c_{i,j} * H_i(x) * H_j(y)
    where H_i and H_j are Hermite polynomials.
    
    The x and y vectors must have the same length, and the function evaluates
    the 2D polynomial at each pair of corresponding points (x[k], y[k]).

/-- Specification: hermval2d correctly evaluates a 2D Hermite polynomial series.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. The result at each point (x[k], y[k]) is the sum ∑_{i,j} c_{i,j} * H_i(x[k]) * H_j(y[k])
    2. Empty coefficient matrix (rows = 0 or cols = 0) evaluates to zero vector
    3. The evaluation is separable: H_i(x) * H_j(y) where H_i, H_j are 1D Hermite polynomials
    4. Hermite polynomials satisfy the recurrence relation in each dimension
    5. The result respects the bilinearity of the 2D Hermite basis
