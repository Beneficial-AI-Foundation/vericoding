/-- numpy.fft.hfft: Compute the FFT of a signal that has Hermitian symmetry.

    The Hermitian FFT assumes that the input signal has Hermitian symmetry,
    which means that the signal in the frequency domain is real-valued.
    This is the inverse operation of rfft.

    For a signal with Hermitian symmetry, the output will be real-valued
    and the length of the transform is determined by the input length.
    If input has length m, the output has length 2*(m-1).

    The function essentially computes the inverse of rfft by taking
    the conjugate of the input and then computing the inverse real FFT.

/-- Specification: numpy.fft.hfft computes the FFT of a signal with Hermitian symmetry.

    Precondition: The input vector represents a Hermitian symmetric signal
    Postcondition: The output is a real-valued vector of length 2*m where
    the input had length m+1, and the transformation preserves certain mathematical 
    properties of the Hermitian FFT including:
    1. The output is real-valued (no imaginary parts)
    2. The length relationship: if input has m+1 elements, output has 2*m elements
    3. Hermitian symmetry properties are preserved in the transform
    4. The conjugate relationship: this is effectively the inverse of an rfft operation
