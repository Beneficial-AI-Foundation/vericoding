/-- numpy.polynomial.laguerre.laggrid3d: Evaluate a 3-D Laguerre series on the Cartesian product of x, y, and z.

    This function computes the values p(a,b,c) = ∑_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * L_i(a) * L_j(b) * L_k(c)
    where the points (a,b,c) consist of all triples formed by taking a from x, b from y, and c from z.
    The resulting points form a grid with x in the first dimension, y in the second, and z in the third.

    The coefficients c represent a 3D tensor where c[i,j,k] is the coefficient for
    the term of multi-degree i,j,k in the Laguerre series expansion.

/-- Specification: laggrid3d evaluates a 3D Laguerre series on the Cartesian product of x, y, and z.

    The function computes p(a,b,c) = ∑_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * L_i(a) * L_j(b) * L_k(c) for each point (a,b,c)
    in the Cartesian product of x, y, and z.

    Precondition: The coefficient tensor c must be non-empty (dim1 > 0, dim2 > 0, and dim3 > 0)
    Postcondition: The result is a 3D grid where result[i][j][k] represents the evaluation
    of the Laguerre series at point (x[i], y[j], z[k]).

    Mathematical properties:
    1. The result has shape (nx, ny, nz) - same as the Cartesian product of x, y, and z
    2. Each element result[i][j][k] is the sum over all coefficient terms c[l][m][n] * L_l(x[i]) * L_m(y[j]) * L_n(z[k])
    3. For constant coefficients (c[0][0][0] only), the result should be constant
    4. The function is linear in the coefficients
