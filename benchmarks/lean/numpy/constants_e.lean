/-- Specification: e is Euler's constant with mathematical properties:
    1. It is approximately 2.718281828459045
    2. It is the unique positive real number such that ln(e) = 1
    3. It is the limit of (1 + 1/n)^n as n approaches infinity
    4. It satisfies the property that the derivative of e^x equals e^x
    5. It is the sum of the infinite series 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + ... -/
