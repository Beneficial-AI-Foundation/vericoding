/-- numpy.polynomial.hermite.poly2herm: Convert a polynomial to a Hermite series.

    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a polynomial (relative
    to the "standard" basis) ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an
    array of the coefficients of the equivalent Hermite series, ordered
    from lowest to highest degree.

    The conversion transforms between different polynomial bases. The standard
    polynomial basis consists of monomials {1, x, x², x³, ...} while the
    Hermite polynomial basis consists of Hermite polynomials {H₀(x), H₁(x), H₂(x), ...}.

    The algorithm uses Hermite polynomial operations (multiplication by x and addition)
    to build up the result iteratively from the highest degree coefficient down.

/-- Specification: poly2herm converts polynomial coefficients to Hermite series coefficients
    
    The specification ensures:
    1. The output has the same dimension as the input
    2. The conversion preserves the polynomial function when evaluated using respective bases
    3. For the zero polynomial (all coefficients zero), the result is also zero
    4. The conversion is linear: poly2herm(a*p + b*q) = a*poly2herm(p) + b*poly2herm(q)
    
    Additionally, for specific test cases:
    - Converting [0, 1, 2, 3] should yield [1, 2.75, 0.5, 0.375]
    - Converting a constant polynomial [c] should yield [c]
