/-- numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebder: Differentiate a Chebyshev series.

    Returns the Chebyshev series coefficients differentiated once.
    The differentiation is based on the recurrence relations for Chebyshev
    polynomials. The derivative is multiplied by a scaling factor.

    For a Chebyshev series c₀T₀ + c₁T₁ + c₂T₂ + ..., the derivative
    follows specific recurrence relations that differ from standard polynomials.

    The derivative of T_n is n*U_{n-1}, where U_{n-1} can be expressed
    in terms of Chebyshev polynomials T_k using specific recurrence relations.

/-- Specification: chebder differentiates a Chebyshev series once.

    The Chebyshev derivative algorithm works by:
    1. Creating a working copy of the coefficients
    2. Applying the recurrence relation from high to low order
    3. Scaling the result

    The recurrence relation for Chebyshev derivatives is:
    - For j ≥ 2: der[j] = 2*(j+1)*c[j+1], and c[j-2] += j*c[j]/(j-2)
    - For j = 1: der[1] = 4*c[2]
    - For j = 0: der[0] = c[1]
    
    All results are then multiplied by the scaling factor.

    Mathematical property: If p(x) = Σ c[i]*T_i(x), then 
    p'(x) = Σ der[i]*T_i(x) where der = chebder(c, scl).

    Precondition: True (works for any non-empty vector)
    Postcondition: 
    - The result has size n
    - The coefficients follow the Chebyshev derivative recurrence relations
    - The result represents scl times the derivative of the input series
