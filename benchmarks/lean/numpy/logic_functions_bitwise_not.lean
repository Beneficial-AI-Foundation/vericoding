/-- numpy.bitwise_not: Compute bit-wise inversion, or bit-wise NOT, element-wise.

    Computes the bit-wise NOT of the underlying binary representation of
    the integers in the input arrays. This ufunc implements the C/Python
    operator ~.

    For signed integer inputs, the bit-wise NOT of the absolute value is
    returned. In a two's-complement system, this operation effectively flips
    all the bits, which results in -(x + 1). This is the most common method
    of representing signed integers on computers.

    Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the bitwise NOT values.

/-- Specification: numpy.bitwise_not returns a vector where each element is the
    bitwise NOT of the corresponding element in x.

    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for bitwise NOT)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = -(x[i] + 1)
    
    This specification captures the mathematical property that bitwise NOT
    of an integer x in two's complement representation equals -(x + 1).
    
    Key properties:
    - Bitwise NOT is its own inverse: ~~x = x
    - For any integer x: ~x = -(x + 1)
    - The operation is element-wise for arrays
