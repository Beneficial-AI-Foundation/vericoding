/-- numpy.atleast_1d: Convert inputs to arrays with at least one dimension.
    
    This function ensures that the input has at least one dimension.
    - Scalar inputs are converted to 1-dimensional arrays with a single element
    - Higher-dimensional inputs (vectors) are preserved unchanged
    
    For the Vector-based implementation, we provide a version that takes
    a vector and returns it unchanged, since Vectors already have at least
    one dimension by construction.

  sorry

/-- Specification: atleast_1d returns the input vector unchanged.
    
    Since Vectors in Lean already have at least one dimension by their type,
    this function acts as an identity function for vectors.
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
    Postcondition: The result is identical to the input vector
