/-- Returns a vector representing a linear polynomial off + scl*x.
    
    For the linear polynomial off + scl*x, this returns:
    - [off, scl] when scl ≠ 0 (degree 1 polynomial)
    - [off] when scl = 0 (degree 0 polynomial, constant)
    
    This follows NumPy's convention where coefficients are ordered from
    lowest to highest degree, so [off, scl] represents off + scl*x.
    
    We use Vector Float 2 to represent the general case, with the understanding
    that when scl = 0, the second coefficient is meaningless.

/-- Specification: polyline creates correct linear polynomial representation.
    
    The function returns coefficients for the linear polynomial off + scl*x:
    - Always returns [off, scl] as a 2-element vector
    - When scl = 0, this represents the constant polynomial off
    - When scl ≠ 0, this represents the linear polynomial off + scl*x
    
    Key properties:
    1. Coefficient structure: coefficients are ordered from lowest to highest degree
    2. Constant term is always off (at index 0)
    3. Linear term coefficient is scl (at index 1)
    4. Evaluation property: at x=0, polynomial evaluates to off
    5. Slope property: derivative of polynomial is scl
    6. Mathematical correctness: represents polynomial off + scl*x
