  //This method should return true iff sub is a substring of str. That is, str contains sub

  //This method should return true iff str1 and str1 have a common substring of length k

  //This method should return the natural number len which is equal to the length of the longest common substring of str1 and str2. Note that every two strings have a common substring of length zero.
