/-- numpy.polynomial.laguerre.poly2lag: Convert a polynomial to a Laguerre series.

    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a polynomial (relative
    to the "standard" basis) ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an
    array of the coefficients of the equivalent Laguerre series, ordered
    from lowest to highest degree.

    Parameters:
    - pol: 1-D array containing the polynomial coefficients

    Returns:
    - c: 1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent Laguerre series.

    Note: The conversion maintains the same degree structure but transforms
    the basis from standard polynomial to Laguerre polynomial basis.

/-- Specification: poly2lag converts polynomial coefficients to Laguerre series coefficients.

    The mathematical property is that the conversion preserves the polynomial
    but expresses it in terms of Laguerre polynomials instead of standard monomials.
    
    Key properties:
    1. Same degree: Both input and output have the same number of coefficients
    2. Basis transformation: Standard polynomial → Laguerre polynomial basis
    3. Orthogonality preservation: The resulting Laguerre series represents the
       same polynomial but in a basis that is orthogonal with respect to exp(-x)

    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for basis conversion)
    Postcondition: The result represents the same polynomial as input but in
                   Laguerre basis, and has the same length as input
