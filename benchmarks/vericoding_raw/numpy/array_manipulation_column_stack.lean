/-- numpy.column_stack: Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.
    
    Takes a sequence of 1-D arrays and stacks them as columns to make a 
    single 2-D array. All input arrays must have the same length (number 
    of rows in the output).
    
    The result is represented as a flattened vector in column-major order,
    where elements from the same column are contiguous. For a result with
    'rows' rows and 'cols' columns, element at position (i, j) is stored
    at index j * rows + i in the flattened vector.
    
    This is a fundamental array manipulation operation that combines multiple
    1D arrays into a single 2D structure, useful for constructing matrices
    from column vectors.

/-- Specification: column_stack creates a 2D array (as flattened vector) where
    each input array becomes a column.
    
    Precondition: cols > 0 (at least one input array)
    Postcondition: 
    - The result contains all elements from the input arrays
    - Elements are arranged in column-major order
    - The j-th column of the result contains all elements from arrays[j]
    - For 0 ≤ i < rows and 0 ≤ j < cols, the element at position (i,j)
      in the 2D view equals arrays[j][i] and is stored at index j*rows + i
