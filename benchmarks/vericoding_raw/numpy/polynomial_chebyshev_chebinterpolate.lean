/-- numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebinterpolate: Interpolate a function at the Chebyshev points of the first kind.
    
    Returns the Chebyshev series coefficients that interpolate the given function
    at the Chebyshev points of the first kind in the interval [-1, 1]. The resulting
    coefficients represent a polynomial of degree deg that interpolates the function
    at deg+1 Chebyshev points.
    
    The Chebyshev interpolation provides near-optimal polynomial approximation
    for continuous functions on [-1, 1], minimizing the Runge phenomenon and
    providing good convergence properties.

/-- Specification: chebinterpolate returns Chebyshev coefficients c such that:
    1. The coefficients form a vector of length deg + 1
    2. When evaluated as a Chebyshev polynomial at the Chebyshev points of the
       first kind, it exactly reproduces the function values at those points
    3. The interpolation is exact at the Chebyshev points: for each Chebyshev
       point x_k = cos(π * k / deg) where k ∈ {0, ..., deg}, the Chebyshev
       polynomial with coefficients c evaluates to func(x_k)
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - The Chebyshev points of the first kind are x_k = cos(π * k / deg) for k = 0, ..., deg
    - The interpolation minimizes the maximum error among all polynomial interpolations
    - For continuous functions, the interpolation converges uniformly as deg increases
    - The coefficients are computed using the discrete cosine transform of the
      function values at the Chebyshev points
    
    Precondition: True (the function can be any Float → Float function)
    Postcondition: The returned coefficients satisfy the interpolation property
                   at all Chebyshev points of the first kind
