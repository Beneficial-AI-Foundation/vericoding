/-- Hermite series whose graph is a straight line.
    
    Creates a Hermite series representation for the line off + scl*x.
    Returns a 2-element vector where:
    - First element is the constant term (off)
    - Second element is the linear coefficient (scl/2)
    
    Note: When scl = 0, the second element is 0, representing a constant function.

/-- Specification: hermline returns Hermite coefficients for a linear function.
    
    The Hermite series representation of off + scl*x has coefficients:
    - c₀ = off (constant term)
    - c₁ = scl/2 (linear term coefficient)
    
    These coefficients, when evaluated as a Hermite series, produce the 
    original linear function. The relationship comes from the fact that
    H₁(x) = 2x in the physicist's Hermite polynomials.
