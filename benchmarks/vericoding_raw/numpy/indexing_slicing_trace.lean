/-- numpy.trace: Return the sum along diagonals of the array.
    
    For a 2D matrix, computes the sum of elements along the diagonal
    with an optional offset. For offset=0, it computes the sum of 
    elements a[i,i] for all valid i. For positive offset, it sums
    a[i,i+offset], and for negative offset, it sums a[i-offset,i].
    
    This implementation focuses on the 2D case as the core functionality.

/-- Specification: numpy.trace returns the sum along the diagonal.
    
    For a 2D matrix with given offset, the trace is the sum of all
    elements a[i,j] where j = i + offset and both i,j are valid indices.
    
    Precondition: True
    Postcondition: Result equals the sum of diagonal elements with given offset
