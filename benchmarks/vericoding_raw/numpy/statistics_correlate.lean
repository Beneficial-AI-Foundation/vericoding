/-- Cross-correlation of two 1-dimensional sequences in 'valid' mode.

/-- Specification: correlate computes cross-correlation with valid mode overlap.
    Each output element is the sum of products of overlapping elements from the input sequences.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. The result has size (m + 1 - n) for valid mode
    2. Each output element k is computed as: sum_i a[k+i] * v[i] for i in [0, n-1]
    3. Only positions where both sequences fully overlap are computed
    4. The correlation preserves the mathematical definition of cross-correlation -/
