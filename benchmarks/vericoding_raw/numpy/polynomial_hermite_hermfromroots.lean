/-- Generate a Hermite series with given roots.
    
    Returns the coefficients of the polynomial p(x) = (x - r₀) * (x - r₁) * ... * (x - rₙ)
    in Hermite form. If a zero has multiplicity n, it must appear n times in the roots vector.
    
    The resulting polynomial is expressed as: p(x) = c₀ + c₁ * H₁(x) + ... + cₙ * Hₙ(x)
    where Hᵢ(x) are Hermite polynomials. -/

/-- Specification: hermfromroots generates Hermite coefficients such that:
    1. The result has length n+1 where n is the number of roots
    2. The polynomial has exactly the given roots (when evaluated using Hermite polynomials)
    3. The leading coefficient is non-zero (for non-empty roots)
    4. For repeated roots, the multiplicity is preserved -/
