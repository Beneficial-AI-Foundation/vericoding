/-- Broadcast two 1D vectors against each other following NumPy broadcasting rules.
    For 1D arrays, broadcasting only happens when one array has size 1.
    The result arrays will have the size of the larger input array. -/

/-- Specification: broadcast_arrays produces two arrays of the same size where:
    1. If an input array has size 1, its single element is replicated to match the other array's size
    2. If both arrays have the same size, they are returned unchanged
    3. The output arrays have size equal to the maximum of the input sizes -/
