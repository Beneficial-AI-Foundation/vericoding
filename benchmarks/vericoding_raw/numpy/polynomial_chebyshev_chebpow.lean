/-- Raise a Chebyshev series to a power.
    
    Returns the Chebyshev series c raised to the power pow. The
    argument c is a sequence of coefficients ordered from low to high,
    i.e., [1,2,3] represents the series T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2.
    
    The power must be a non-negative integer. Special cases:
    - pow = 0 returns [1] (the constant polynomial 1)
    - pow = 1 returns the input series unchanged
    - pow > 1 returns the series multiplied by itself pow times
    
    The result length grows as: 1 + (n - 1) * pow, where n is the input length. -/

/-- Specification: chebpow computes the power of a Chebyshev series.
    
    This specification captures:
    1. Special cases for pow = 0 and pow = 1
    2. The mathematical property that (T(x))^pow represents the polynomial T(x) raised to power pow
    3. The result is a valid Chebyshev series representation
    
    Key properties:
    - pow = 0: Returns [1], representing the constant polynomial 1
    - pow = 1: Returns the input unchanged
    - pow > 1: Returns coefficients such that if c represents T(x), result represents (T(x))^pow
    
    The specification ensures:
    - Correct handling of the constant term (T_0 coefficient)
    - Proper coefficient computation through repeated Chebyshev multiplication
    - Result represents the mathematical power of the input polynomial -/
