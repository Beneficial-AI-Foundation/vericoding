/-- numpy.c_: Translates slice objects to concatenation along the second axis.
    
    This function takes two vectors and stacks them as columns to create a 2-D array.
    Each input vector becomes a column in the resulting matrix.
    
    This is equivalent to column_stack([arr1, arr2]) for 1-D arrays.

/-- Specification: c_ creates a 2-D array by stacking two vectors as columns.
