/-- numpy.sum: Sum of array elements over a given axis.

    Computes the sum of all elements in the vector. For empty vectors,
    returns 0 as the identity element of addition.
    
    This is a reduction operation that applies addition across all
    elements to produce a single scalar result.
    
    Mathematical Properties:
    - Commutative: order of elements doesn't affect the final sum
    - Associative: grouping of operations doesn't affect the result
    - Identity element: empty array sum is 0
    - Distributive: sum(a * c) = c * sum(a) for scalar c
    
    From NumPy documentation:
    - Parameters: a (array_like) - Elements to sum
    - Returns: sum_along_axis (ndarray) - Sum of array elements
    - The function handles axis parameter (ignored in 1D case)
    - Supports optional dtype, initial value, and where condition

/-- Specification: sum computes the sum of all elements in a vector.
    
    The sum operation has several important mathematical properties:
    1. For empty vectors, returns 0 (additive identity)
    2. For non-empty vectors, returns the sum of all elements
    3. The operation is commutative and associative
    4. Linearity: sum(a + b) = sum(a) + sum(b) (element-wise addition)
    5. Scalar multiplication: sum(c * a) = c * sum(a) for scalar c
    
    This specification captures both the basic behavior and key mathematical
    properties that make sum well-defined and predictable.
    
    Precondition: True (works for any vector, including empty)
    Postcondition: Result equals the sum of all elements using fold operation
