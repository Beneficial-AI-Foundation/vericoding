/-- numpy.spacing: Return the distance between x and the nearest adjacent number.
    
    For each element x in the input array, returns the distance to the nearest
    adjacent floating-point number. This is equivalent to the machine epsilon
    for the magnitude of x - it gives the smallest representable difference
    between floating-point numbers near x.
    
    For x = 1.0, spacing(1.0) equals the machine epsilon.
    Spacing of ±inf and NaN is NaN.
    
    This function is crucial for understanding floating-point precision limits
    and is used in numerical analysis for error bounds and convergence testing.

/-- Specification: numpy.spacing returns the distance between each element 
    and its nearest adjacent floating-point number.
    
    Precondition: True (spacing is defined for all floating-point numbers)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] represents the smallest positive
    difference between x[i] and the next representable floating-point number.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - spacing(x) > 0 for all finite x (distance is always positive)
    - spacing(1.0) = machine epsilon
    - No representable number exists between x and x + spacing(x)
    - spacing(±∞) = NaN and spacing(NaN) = NaN
    - spacing(-x) = spacing(x) for finite x (symmetry around zero)
    - spacing grows with the magnitude of x (floating-point spacing increases)
