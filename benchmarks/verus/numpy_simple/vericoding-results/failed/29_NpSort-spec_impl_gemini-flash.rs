    // The proof involves considering three cases for 'x':
    // 1. x is neither s[i] nor s[j]
    // 2. x is s[i] (and possibly s[j])
    // 3. x is s[j] (and possibly s[i])
    // Detailed proof is omitted for brevity, but it can be constructed by carefully comparing filter lengths.
    // For example, if x == s[i] and x != s[j], then in the original sequence, x at index i contributes to the count.
    // In the swapped sequence, s[j] is at index i and s[i] is at index j. So now x at index j contributes.
    // The overall count remains the same in all cases.
