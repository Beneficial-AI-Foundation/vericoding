  numpy.bincount: Count number of occurrences of each value in array of non-negative ints.

  Count number of occurrences of each value in array of non-negative ints.
  The number of bins (of size 1) is one larger than the largest value in x.
  Each bin gives the number of occurrences of its index value in x.

  This function takes a 1D array of non-negative integers and returns
  an array where the i-th element is the count of how many times the
  value i appears in the input array.

  Specification: numpy.bincount returns count of occurrences of each value.

  Precondition: All values in x are non-negative and â‰¤ max_val
  Postcondition: result[i] = count of occurrences of value i in x
