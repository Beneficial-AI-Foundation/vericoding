vc-description: |-
  Return numbers spaced evenly on a log scale.

  Creates a vector of `num` samples where each element is computed as:
  - When endpoint=true: base^(start + i * (stop - start) / (num - 1)) for i in 0..num-1
  - When endpoint=false: base^(start + i * (stop - start) / num) for i in 0..num-1

  The samples are evenly spaced in log space, meaning the exponents form an arithmetic sequence.

  Specification: logspace generates numbers evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale.

  The function produces a vector where:
  1. For endpoint=true: Elements follow base^(interpolated exponent) where exponents 
     are linearly interpolated from start to stop inclusive
  2. For endpoint=false: Similar but stop value is excluded from the range
  3. The base must be positive and not equal to 1 for meaningful results
  4. For num > 1, the spacing between consecutive log values is uniform
