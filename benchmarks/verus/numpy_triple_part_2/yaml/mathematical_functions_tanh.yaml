vc-description: |-
  Compute hyperbolic tangent element-wise.

  The hyperbolic tangent function is defined as:
  tanh(x) = sinh(x) / cosh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))

  This function is bounded between -1 and 1, and is the ratio of
  hyperbolic sine to hyperbolic cosine. It has a sigmoid-like shape,
  approaching -1 as x approaches negative infinity and approaching 1
  as x approaches positive infinity.

  Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the hyperbolic tangent of each element.

  Specification: numpy.tanh returns a vector where each element is the hyperbolic tangent
  of the corresponding element in x.

  Precondition: True (no special preconditions for hyperbolic tangent)
  Postcondition: 
  1. For all indices i, result[i] = sinh(x[i]) / cosh(x[i])
  2. The function is odd: tanh(-x) = -tanh(x)
  3. The function is bounded: -1 < tanh(x) < 1 for all x ≠ 0
  4. Monotonicity: tanh is strictly increasing on all of ℝ
  5. Zero property: tanh(0) = 0
  6. Limit properties: lim_{x→∞} tanh(x) = 1 and lim_{x→-∞} tanh(x) = -1
  7. Sign property: tanh(x) has the same sign as x
  8. Derivative property: d/dx tanh(x) = 1 - tanh²(x)
