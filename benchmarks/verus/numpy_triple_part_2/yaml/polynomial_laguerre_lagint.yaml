  numpy.polynomial.laguerre.lagint: Integrate a Laguerre series.

  Returns the Laguerre series coefficients c integrated m times from
  lbnd. At each iteration the resulting series is multiplied by scl 
  and an integration constant k is added. The scaling factor is for use 
  in a linear change of variable.

  The argument c is a vector of coefficients from low to high degree,
  e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series L_0 + 2*L_1 + 3*L_2.

  Specification: lagint integrates a Laguerre series.

  Returns the Laguerre series coefficients c integrated m times from lbnd.
  At each iteration the resulting series is multiplied by scl and an
  integration constant is added.

  Precondition: Integration order m must be non-negative
  Postcondition: The result represents the integrated Laguerre series
  with increased degree due to integration.

  Mathematical properties:
  1. The result has degree n + m - 1 (m integrations increase degree by m)
  2. Integration is linear: lagint(α*c1 + β*c2) = α*lagint(c1) + β*lagint(c2) 
  3. For zero coefficients, integration with constants gives the constant
  4. Multiple integrations accumulate degree increases
