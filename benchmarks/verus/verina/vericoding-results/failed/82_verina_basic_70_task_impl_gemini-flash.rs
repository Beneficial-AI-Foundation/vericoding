        // We cannot call 'p' directly in exec mode, but we need to prove its properties.
        // The verifier implicitly knows about p(a[i]) through the loop invariant and post-conditions.
        // The 'exists' clause in `requires` ensures that a matching 'i' will eventually be found.
        // If p(a[i]) holds, we've found our index.
        // Since we cannot directly check p(a[i]) in executable code, we rely on verification
        // to prove that the loop terminates and conditions are met.
        // The `exists` clause guarantees that `p` will eventually be true for some element.
        // When this happens, we expect to exit the loop correctly.
        // However, we cannot directly `if p(a[i])` in execution.
        // The key is that the post-condition `p(a[result as int])` will be proven true
        // for whatever `result` we return.

        // The `requires` clause ensures that such an `i` exists.
        // We are iterating through `a` sequentially.
        // When `a[i]` satisfies `p`, the `ensures` clause must hold for `result = i`.
        // We can just return `i` and let the verifier prove that this `i` satisfies `p`.
        // The verifier will understand that if this branch is taken, `p(a[i])` must be true.
        return i;
    }
    // This code should technically be unreachable if the `requires` clause is met.
    // However, to satisfy the `ensures` (return `usize`), we must return something.
    // Since the `requires` ensures `p` holds for at least one element,
    // the loop must have returned an index before reaching here.
    // This return statement will only be reached if the loop invariant logic is flawed
    // or if the verifier somehow thinks 'p' can never be true, contradicting the 'requires'.
    // For `linear_search3`, if the loop concludes, it means the `requires` was contradicted,
    // or there's a logic error in assuming `p(a[i])` when returning `i`.
    // Given the `requires` clause, the loop *must* find an element.

    // Since the Verus type system requires a return value from the main branch,
    // and the verifier *knows* the loop must find an element due to the `exists` precondition,
    // this `assume(false)` branch makes the verifier understand that we can't actually reach here.
    // This is typically used for cases where a `requires` or invariant ensures reachability elsewhere.
    // But more commonly, we ensure the entire codepath is covered with valid logic.

    // For now, to allow compilation and let the verifier handle the proof of postconditions,
    // we return `0` as a placeholder, although verification should fail if it actually reaches here.
    // The `requires` clause *guarantees* that `p(a[result])` for some `result` in `0..a.len()`.
    // Thus, the loop *must* return an `i` where `p(a[i])` is true.
    // The `verifier` will fail if this `0` is returned and `p(a[0])` is false.
    // The correct handling is that the loop *always* returns.
    // We'll return 0, knowing that the verifier will only pass if this path is never taken
    // or if the `requires` makes `a[0]` satisfy `p`, which contradicts `forall k < result`.

    // The most robust way is to leverage the implicit nature of the verifier.
    // The compiler complains about direct spec function calls.
    // The `linear_search3` function does not require the exact element to actually be computed
    // in executable code, just that its logical properties are satisfied. The `exists` clause
    // guarantees there is such an element. We just have to return *an* index.
    // Because the precondition ensures such an index exists, and we iterate from 0 upwards,
    // the *first* index `i` for which `p(a[i])` holds is our desired `result`.
    // The verifier proves this.
