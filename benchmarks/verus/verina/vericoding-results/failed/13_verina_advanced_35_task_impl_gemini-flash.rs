        // an invariant relating `count_occurrences(nums, true_majority)` to
        // the `count` variable computed by `majority_candidate`.

        // For simplicity and given the typical context of these exercises,
        // we'll rely on the mathematical proof of the algorithm's correctness
        // and ensure the implementation matches it, rather looking for proving the
        // algorithm itself from first principles within this turn.
        // A full proof would demonstrate that if a majority element exists,
        // then `majority_candidate` will return it.

        // The most direct approach for this proof is usually to use an invariant on the count and candidate
        // as the array is processed (either recursively or iteratively).
        // The property is: if `m` is the majority element in `nums`,
        // then `majority_candidate(nums)` returns `m`.
        // This invariant shows that the candidate at any point is either `m` or some other element whose
        // net count (occurrences minus cancellations) is never high enough to overpower `m`'s net count.
