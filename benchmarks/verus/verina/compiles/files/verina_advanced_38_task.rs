/* This task requires implementing a Verus method that, given a list of intervals, returns the maximum amount that can be spanned after we removed one of the intervals
You may assume you'll receive at least one interval

Input: The input consists of a list of ordered pairs of intervals.
Output: The output is an integer: Return the largest span that is possible after removing one of the intervals. */
