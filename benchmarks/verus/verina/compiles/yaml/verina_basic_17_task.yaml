vc-description: |-
  This task requires writing a Verus method that converts all uppercase characters in a given string to their lowercase equivalents while keeping the other characters unchanged. The output string must have the same length as the input string.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  s: A string that may contain both uppercase and lowercase characters.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a string:
  Returns a new string where every uppercase letter has been converted to lowercase, and every non-uppercase character remains exactly as in the input.
  
  -----Note-----
  There are no preconditions; the method is expected to work for any non-null string.
