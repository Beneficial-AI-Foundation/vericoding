vc-description: |-
  This task requires writing a Verus method that locates the first occurrence of a specified integer within a sorted array of integers. The method returns the index corresponding to the first time the target value appears in the array; if the target is absent, it returns -1. It is also essential that the original array remains unchanged.
  
  Input:
  The input consists of:
  • arr: An array of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
  • target: An integer representing the value to search for.
  
  Output:
  The output is an integer:
  • If the target is found, the method returns the index of its first occurrence.
  • If the target is not found, the method returns -1.
  
  Note:
  • The input array must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  • The array is guaranteed to remain unmodified after the method executes.
