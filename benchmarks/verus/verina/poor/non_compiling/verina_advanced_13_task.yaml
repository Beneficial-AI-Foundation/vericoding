vc-description: |-
  This task requires writing a Verus method that determines whether there are any intersections between chords on a circle. The method should return true if at least one pair of chords intersects, and false otherwise.
  
  A chord is defined as a line segment connecting two distinct points on a circle. Two chords intersect if they cross each other inside the circle. The points are numbered from 1 to 2N in a clockwise direction, where N is the number of chords.
  
  Constraints
  
  - 2 ≤ N ≤ 2×10^5
  - 1 ≤ A_i,B_i ≤ 2N
  - A_1,…,A_N,B_1,…,B_N are all distinct
  - All input values are integers
  
  Input:
  The input consists of two parameters:
  N: A natural number representing the number of chords (2 ≤ N ≤ 2×10^5).
  chords: A list of N pairs of natural numbers, where each pair represents the endpoints of a chord. All endpoint values are distinct and range from 1 to 2N.
  
  Output:
  The output is a boolean value:
  - Returns true if there exists at least one pair of intersecting chords.
  - Returns false if no chords intersect.
  
  /* All endpoints are distinct */
