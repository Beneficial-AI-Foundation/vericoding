vc-description: |-
  This task requires writing a Verus method of which given a number n and divisor d, it counts all the number that is smaller than
  n whose sum of digits is divisible by d.
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of two usize:
  n: usize
  d: usize where d > 0
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a natural number:
  Ensure this match the count that satisfy the property.
