vc-description: |-
  This task requires writing a Verus method that removes all occurrences of a given element from a list of natural numbers. The method should return a new list that contains all the elements of the original list except those equal to the target number. The order of the remaining elements must be preserved.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of two elements:
  lst: A list of natural numbers (Vec<nat>).
  target: A natural number to be removed from the list.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a list of natural numbers:
  Returns a new list with all occurrences of the target number removed. The relative order of the remaining elements must be the same as in the input list.
