  Given an integer x, determine a pair (a, b) where the first element is twice the value of x and the second element is four times the value of x.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  • x: An integer.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a tuple (a, b) where:
  • a = 2 * x
  • b = 4 * x
  
  -----Note-----
  There are no additional preconditions; the method is defined for all integers.
