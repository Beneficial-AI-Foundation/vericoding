  This task requires computing three times the given integer. The goal is to determine the product of the input integer and 3.
  
  The input consists of:
  • x: An integer.
  
  The output is an integer that represents three times the input value.
  
  The implementation uses two different branches based on the value of x (i.e., x < 18 or x ≥ 18), but both branches guarantee that the result equals 3*x.
