vc-description: |-
  This task involves computing the average of two integers. The objective is to determine a value that closely approximates the true arithmetic mean when using integer division, ensuring that the result reflects the necessary rounding behavior.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  â€¢ a: An integer.
  â€¢ b: An integer.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is an integer representing the computed average of a and b using integer division.
  
  -----Note-----
  The specification requires that the computed average satisfies the condition that 2 * avg is between (a + b - 1) and (a + b + 1), ensuring that the result meets the expected rounding boundaries.
