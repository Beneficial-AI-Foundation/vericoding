vc-description: |-
  This task involves finding the minimum element in a non-empty array of integers. The goal is to identify and return the smallest number present in the array.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  • a: An array of integers (the array is assumed to be non-empty).
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is an integer that:
  • Is the smallest element from the input array.
  • Satisfies the property that it is less than or equal to every element in the array and is exactly equal to at least one element of the array.
  
  -----Note-----
  It is assumed that the input array contains at least one element. The implementation uses a helper function (loop) to recursively compare elements and determine the minimum value.
