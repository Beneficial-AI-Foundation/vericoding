  -----Description-----
  The problem asks you to construct a new list by adding an extra number to the end of an existing list of numbers. The focus is on understanding what the final list should look like when a given number is included as the last element.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  • a: An array of integers.
  • b: An integer to be appended to the array.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is an array of integers which represents the original array with the element b added at the end. That is, the output array's list representation equals a.toList concatenated with [b].
  
  -----Note-----
  There are no special preconditions; the method is expected to work correctly for any array of integers and any integer b.
