vc-description: |-
  This task requires writing a Verus function called `solution` that takes a vector of natural numbers `nums`. The function should calculate and return the sum of values obtained for each subarray, where the value for a subarray is the square of the count of distinct elements within that subarray.
  
  Input:
  The input is a vector of natural numbers:
  `nums`: A vector where each element is a natural number.
  Constraints:
  - The length of the vector `nums` (n) is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
  - Each element in `nums` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
  
  Output:
  The output is a natural number:
  Returns the total sum of squared distinct counts for all subarrays.
