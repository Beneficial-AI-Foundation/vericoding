vc-description: |-
  This task requires writing a Verus method that computes the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers. The result should match the formula: (n * (2 * n - 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 3.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  n: A natural number representing the count of odd natural numbers to consider (n should be non-negative).
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a natural number:
  Returns the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers, as defined by the formula: (n * (2 * n - 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 3.
