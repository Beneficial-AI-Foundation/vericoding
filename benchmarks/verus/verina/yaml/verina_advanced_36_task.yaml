vc-description: |-
  This task requires writing a Verus method that finds the majority element in a list of natural numbers. The majority element is defined as the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times in the list, where n is the total number of elements.
  
  You may assume that the input list always contains a majority element.
  
  Input: The input consists of one list:
  xs: A list of natural numbers (Vec<u64>), where a majority element is guaranteed to exist.
  
  Output: The output is a natural number:
  Returns the element that appears more than half the time in the input list.
