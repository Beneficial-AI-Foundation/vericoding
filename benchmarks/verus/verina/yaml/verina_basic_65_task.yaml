vc-description: |-
  This task involves computing the integer square root of a given natural number. The goal is to determine the largest natural number r that satisfies r * r ≤ N and N < (r + 1) * (r + 1).
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  • N: A natural number.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a natural number r that meets the following conditions:
  • r * r ≤ N
  • N < (r + 1) * (r + 1)
  
  -----Note-----
  The implementation relies on a recursive strategy to iteratively increment r until (r + 1)*(r + 1) exceeds N. Edge cases, such as N = 0, should be handled correctly.
