  This task involves determining whether two integer values are equal. The goal is simply to compare the two provided numbers and indicate with a Boolean result whether they are the same.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of two elements:
  • a: An element of type Int.
  • b: An element of type Int.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a Boolean:
  • Returns true if a equals b.
  • Returns false if a does not equal b.
