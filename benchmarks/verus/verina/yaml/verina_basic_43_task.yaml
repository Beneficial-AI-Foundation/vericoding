vc-description: |-
  This task requires writing a Verus method that computes the sum of the fourth power of the first n odd natural numbers. In other words, given a non-negative integer n, the method should calculate the sum: 1⁴ + 3⁴ + 5⁴ + ... for the first n odd numbers.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  n: A non-negative natural number representing the number of odd natural numbers to consider.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a natural number:
  Returns the sum of the fourth power of the first n odd natural numbers.
  
  -----Note-----
  The input n is assumed to be a non-negative integer.
  The correctness of the result is established by a theorem that relates the computed sum to a specific formula.
