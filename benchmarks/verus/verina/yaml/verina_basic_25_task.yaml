vc-description: |-
  This task requires writing a Verus method that calculates both the sum and the average of the first n natural numbers. The method should compute the sum of numbers from 0 to n (which equals n * (n + 1) / 2) and then determine the average by dividing this sum by n. The specification assumes that the input n is a positive integer.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  n: A natural number representing the count of the first natural numbers. The value of n is assumed to be positive.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a pair consisting of:
  - An integer representing the sum of the first n natural numbers.
  - A floating-point number representing the average of the first n natural numbers.
  
  -----Note-----
  The input n must be a positive integer.
