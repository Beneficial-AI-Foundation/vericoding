vc-description: |-
  This task requires writing a Verus method that calculates the surface area of a cube based on the length of one of its edges. The method should compute the surface area using the standard formula for a cube.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of:
  size: A natural number representing the length of an edge of the cube.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a natural number:
  Returns the surface area of the cube.
