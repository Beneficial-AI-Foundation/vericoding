vc-description: |-
  This task involves creating a function that swaps two integer values. Given two integers, the function should return a pair where the first element is the second input value and the second element is the first input value.
  
  -----Input-----
  The input consists of two integers:
  • X: An integer representing the first value.
  • Y: An integer representing the second value.
  
  -----Output-----
  The output is a pair (i32, i32) that:
  • Contains the original Y as the first element.
  • Contains the original X as the second element.
  
  -----Note-----
  There are no additional preconditions. The function simply swaps the two input values.
