/* This task requires writing a Verus method that finds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence from a given list of integers.

-----Input-----
The input consists of a list of integers called nums

-----Output-----
The output is an integer:
Returns a number representing the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence found in the input list. */
