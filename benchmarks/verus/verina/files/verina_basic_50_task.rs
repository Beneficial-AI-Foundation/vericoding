/* This task is about calculating the absolute value of an integer. The goal is to determine the non-negative value of a given integer: if the integer is non-negative, it remains unchanged; if it is negative, its positive counterpart is returned.

-----Input-----
The input consists of:
• x: An integer.

-----Output-----
The output is an integer that represents the absolute value of the input. Specifically:
• If x is non-negative, the output is x.
• If x is negative, the output is the negation of x (that is, a value y such that x + y = 0).

-----Note-----
This function should correctly handle zero, positive, and negative integers. */
