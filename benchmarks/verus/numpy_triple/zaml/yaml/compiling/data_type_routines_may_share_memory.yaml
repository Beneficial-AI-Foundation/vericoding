  /*
  numpy.may_share_memory: Determine if two arrays might share memory.
  
  This function conservatively checks if two arrays might share memory.
  A return of True does not necessarily mean that the two arrays share any element.
  It just means that they might.
  
  Only the memory bounds of a and b are checked by default.
  
  Specification: may_share_memory returns a boolean indicating whether two arrays might share memory.
  
  Precondition: True (no special preconditions needed)
  Postcondition: The function returns a boolean value. If the arrays are identical references,
  it must return True. For independent arrays, it may return False.
  The function is conservative - it can return True even when arrays don't actually share memory.
