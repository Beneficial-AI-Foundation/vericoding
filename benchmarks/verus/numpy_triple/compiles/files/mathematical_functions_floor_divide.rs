/* numpy.floor_divide: Return the largest integer smaller or equal to the division of the inputs.

Performs element-wise floor division of two vectors. For each pair of elements,
returns the largest integer less than or equal to their division.

This is equivalent to the Python // operator and pairs with the modulo operation
such that a = a % b + b * (a // b) up to roundoff.

Specification: numpy.floor_divide returns a vector where each element is the floor
of the division of the corresponding elements from x1 and x2.

This function implements Python's // operator behavior for element-wise operations.

Precondition: All elements in x2 must be non-zero
Postcondition: 
1. For all indices i, result[i] = floor(x1[i] / x2[i])
2. For all indices i, result[i] is the largest integer ≤ x1[i] / x2[i]
3. The fundamental floor division property: result[i] ≤ x1[i] / x2[i] < result[i] + 1
4. This pairs with modulo such that: x1[i] = x2[i] * result[i] + remainder */
