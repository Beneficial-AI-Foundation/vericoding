/* numpy.column_stack: Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.
    
Takes a sequence of 1-D arrays and stacks them as columns to make a 
single 2-D array. All input arrays must have the same length (number 
of rows in the output).
    
The result is represented as a flattened vector in column-major order,
where elements from the same column are contiguous. For a result with
'rows' rows and 'cols' columns, element at position (i, j) is stored
at index j * rows + i in the flattened vector.
    
This is a fundamental array manipulation operation that combines multiple
1D arrays into a single 2D structure, useful for constructing matrices
from column vectors.

Specification: column_stack creates a 2D array (as flattened vector) where
each input array becomes a column.
    
Precondition: cols > 0 (at least one input array)
Postcondition: 
- The result contains all elements from the input arrays
- Elements are arranged in column-major order
- The j-th column of the result contains all elements from arrays[j]
- For 0 ≤ i < rows and 0 ≤ j < cols, the element at position (i,j)
  in the 2D view equals arrays[j][i] and is stored at index j*rows + i */
