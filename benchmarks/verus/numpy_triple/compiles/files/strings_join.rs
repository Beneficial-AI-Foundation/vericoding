/* numpy.strings.join: Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the sequence seq.

For each pair of separator and sequence, join the elements of the sequence using the separator.
This function operates element-wise on vectors, where each element of the result is obtained
by joining the corresponding elements of the sequence vector using the corresponding separator.

The function treats each string in the sequence as a sequence of characters, and joins them
with the separator string. For example, join('-', 'abc') produces 'a-b-c'.

From NumPy documentation:
- Parameters: sep (array_like) - Separator string(s), seq (array_like) - Sequence(s) to join
- Returns: out (ndarray) - Output array with joined strings
- Examples: join('-', 'osd') → 'o-s-d', join(['-', '.'], ['ghc', 'osd']) → ['g-h-c', 'o.s.d']

Mathematical Properties:
1. Element-wise operation: result[i] = join(sep[i], seq[i])
2. Character separation: joins individual characters of each string in seq
3. Empty separator handling: join('', s) = s (no separation)
4. Empty sequence handling: join(sep, '') = '' (empty result)
5. Single character sequences: join(sep, 'a') = 'a' (no separator needed)

Specification: numpy.strings.join returns a vector where each element is the result
of joining the characters of the corresponding sequence element with the separator.

This function performs element-wise string joining operations. For each index i,
it takes the string seq[i], treats it as a sequence of characters, and joins them
using sep[i] as the separator.

Mathematical Properties:
1. Element-wise correctness: For each i, result[i] is formed by joining characters
   of seq[i] with sep[i]
2. Character-level operation: Each character in seq[i] is separated by sep[i]
3. Empty string handling: join(sep, '') = '' for any separator
4. Single character handling: join(sep, 'c') = 'c' (no separator added)
5. Multiple character handling: join('-', 'abc') = 'a-b-c'
6. Length property: For non-empty strings with length > 1, the result length is
   original_length + (original_length - 1) * separator_length
7. Preservation of empty inputs: Empty strings remain empty regardless of separator
8. Character order preservation: Characters appear in the same order as in input

Sanity checks:
- Result vector has same length as input vectors
- Empty sequences produce empty results
- Single character sequences produce the original character
- Multiple character sequences are properly separated
- Each result character is either from the original string or the separator
- No characters are lost or duplicated (except separators)

Precondition: True (no special preconditions for string joining)
Postcondition: Each result element is the join of characters from the corresponding
               sequence element using the corresponding separator, with proper
               length and character ordering properties */
