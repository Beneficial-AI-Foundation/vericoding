/* Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-Hermite quadrature */

/* Specification: hermgauss returns quadrature points and weights that satisfy key properties:
   1. The points are roots of the deg-th Hermite polynomial
   2. The weights are positive
   3. The weights sum to a positive value (specifically sqrt(π))
   4. The quadrature exactly integrates polynomials up to degree 2*deg - 1 with weight exp(-x²)
   5. Points are symmetric around 0 and are distinct */
