/* numpy.ndarray.flat: A 1-D iterator over the array.

This operation provides a flattened view of the array, allowing access
to elements as if the array were 1-dimensional. For 1D arrays, this is
essentially an identity operation that provides indexed access to elements.

The flat iterator acts as a view into the underlying array data, preserving
the order of elements as they appear in memory (row-major order).

Specification: numpy.ndarray.flat returns a flattened view of the array.

Precondition: True (no special preconditions for flattening)
Postcondition: The result contains the same elements in the same order,
               providing a 1D view of the input array */
