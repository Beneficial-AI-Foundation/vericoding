/* Compute the q-th percentile of the data in a vector.
For a sorted vector, the q-th percentile is the value below which q percent of the data falls.
This implementation focuses on the fundamental mathematical definition of percentiles.

Specification: percentile computes the q-th percentile value correctly.
The percentile is defined as the value v such that at least q% of the data
is less than or equal to v, and at least (100-q)% of the data is greater than or equal to v.

Mathematical properties:
1. The percentile value must be within the range of the data (or interpolated between values)
2. Special cases: q=0 gives minimum, q=100 gives maximum
3. The result is bounded by the minimum and maximum values in the array */
