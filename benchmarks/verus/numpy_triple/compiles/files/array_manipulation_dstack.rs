/* numpy.dstack: Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).

For a sequence of 1D arrays (vectors), this function stacks them along a new third axis,
creating a 3D array. Each input vector becomes a "slice" in the depth dimension.

For 1D inputs of length n, the output shape is (1, n, k) where k is the number of arrays.
This is because 1D arrays are first reshaped to (1, n) then stacked along axis 2.

The result is always at least 3-dimensional.

Specification: numpy.dstack stacks 1D arrays along the third axis.

For k+1 input vectors each of length n:
- The output has shape (1, n, k+1)
- Element at position [0][i][j] equals arrays[j][i]

This specification captures the core behavior where each input vector
contributes one "layer" in the depth dimension of the output. */
