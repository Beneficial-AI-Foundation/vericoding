/* Euler's constant (e), the base of natural logarithms */

/* Specification: e is Euler's constant with mathematical properties:
   1. It is approximately 2.718281828459045
   2. It is the unique positive real number such that ln(e) = 1
   3. It is the limit of (1 + 1/n)^n as n approaches infinity
   4. It satisfies the property that the derivative of e^x equals e^x
   5. It is the sum of the infinite series 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + ... */

    /* Mathematical property: e is approximately 2.718281828459045 (NumPy's precision) */
    /* Mathematical property: e is positive */
    /* Mathematical property: e is greater than 2 but less than 3 */
    /* Mathematical property: More precise bounds based on known rational approximations */
    /* e is between 2.71828182 and 2.71828183 */
    /* Mathematical property: e > 5/2 and e < 11/4 (classical rational bounds) */
    /* Mathematical property: e is greater than (1 + 1/1000000)^1000000 (approximation of limit definition) */
    /* This approximates the limit definition of e = lim(n→∞) (1 + 1/n)^n */
    /* Mathematical property: Relation to natural logarithm base (if ln(x) = 1 then x = e) */
