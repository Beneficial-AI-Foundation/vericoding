The average is taken over the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis. float64 intermediate and return values are used for integer inputs.\n\nParameters\n----------\na : array_like\n    Array containing numbers whose mean is desired. If a is not an array, a conversion is attempted.\naxis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional\n    Axis or axes along which the means are computed. The default is to compute the mean of the flattened array.\ndtype : data-type, optional\n    Type to use in computing the mean. For integer inputs, the default is float64; for floating point inputs, it is the same as the input dtype.\nout : ndarray, optional\n    Alternate output array in which to place the result. The default is None.\nkeepdims : bool, optional\n    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one.\nwhere : array_like of bool, optional\n    Elements to include in the mean.\n\nReturns\n-------\nm : ndarray, see dtype parameter above\n    If out=None, returns a new array containing the mean values, otherwise a reference to the output array is returned.\n\nNotes\n-----\nThe arithmetic mean is the sum of the elements along the axis divided by the number of elements.\n\nNote that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the same precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32. Specifying a higher-precision accumulator using the dtype keyword can alleviate this issue.",

/* Computes the arithmetic mean of all elements in a non-empty vector */

/* Specification: mean computes the arithmetic average of all elements.
   Mathematical properties:
   1. The result is the sum of all elements divided by the count
   2. The mean lies between the minimum and maximum values
   3. For constant vectors, mean equals the constant value */
