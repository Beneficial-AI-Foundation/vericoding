/* Return the cumulative product of array elements treating NaNs as 1.
The cumulative product does not change when NaNs are encountered and leading NaNs are replaced by ones.

Specification: nancumprod returns the cumulative product while treating NaN values as 1.
This means:
1. The resulting array has the same size as the input
2. Each element is the product of all non-NaN elements from the start up to that position
3. NaN values are treated as 1 in the product calculation
4. Leading NaNs are replaced by ones
5. The cumulative product property holds for non-NaN values */
