  "doc": "Computes the outer product of two vectors. Given two vectors a = [a0, a1, ..., aM] and b = [b0, b1, ..., bN], the outer product is: [[a0*b0  a0*b1 ... a0*bN ]\n [a1*b0  a1*b1 ... a1*bN ]\n [ ...              ...]\n [aM*b0  aM*b1 ... aM*bN ]]",
}

Compute the outer product of two vectors.
Given vectors a of size m and b of size n, produces an m√ón matrix
where element (i,j) equals a[i] * b[j].

Specification: The outer product produces a matrix where each element (i,j)
is the product of the i-th element of the first vector and the j-th element
of the second vector. This captures the fundamental mathematical property
that outer(a,b)[i,j] = a[i] * b[j].

The specification includes:
1. Core property: Each matrix element equals the product of corresponding vector elements
2. Row structure: Each row i is the vector b scaled by a[i]
3. Column structure: Each column j is the vector a scaled by b[j]
4. Bilinearity: The outer product is linear in both arguments

This captures the essential mathematical behavior of the outer product operation,
which is fundamental in linear algebra and tensor analysis. */
