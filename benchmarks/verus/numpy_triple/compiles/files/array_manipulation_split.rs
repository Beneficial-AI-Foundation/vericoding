/* Split a vector into k equal parts. Requires that the vector length is divisible by k.

Specification: split divides a vector into k equal-sized sub-vectors 
where each sub-vector contains consecutive elements from the original.

The specification states that:
1. The result is a vector of k sub-vectors
2. Each sub-vector has size n/k 
3. Element j of sub-vector i corresponds to element (i * (n/k) + j) of the original vector
4. All elements from the original vector are preserved in the split */
