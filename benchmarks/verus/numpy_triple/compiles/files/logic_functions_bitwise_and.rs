/* Compute the bit-wise AND of two arrays element-wise.

Computes the bit-wise AND of the underlying binary representation of
the integers in the input arrays. This ufunc implements the C/Python
operator &.

Parameters
----------
x1, x2 : array_like
    Only integer and boolean types are handled.
    If x1.shape != x2.shape, they must be broadcastable to a common
    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the out array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the out array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized out array is created via the default
    out=None, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    ufunc docs.

Returns
-------
out : ndarray or scalar
    Result.
    This is a scalar if both x1 and x2 are scalars.

Compute the bit-wise AND of two vectors element-wise.
Computes the bit-wise AND of the underlying binary representation of
the natural numbers in the input vectors.

Specification: bitwise_and computes element-wise bitwise AND operation 

This specification captures the mathematical properties of bitwise AND:
- Commutativity: a & b = b & a
- Associativity: (a & b) & c = a & (b & c)
- Identity with all bits set: a & (-1) = a (but using max value for Nat)
- Absorption with zero: a & 0 = 0
- Idempotent: a & a = a
- Monotonicity: if a ≤ b, then a & c ≤ b & c */
