/* numpy.finfo: Machine limits for floating point types.
    
    Returns machine limits for the Float type in Lean.
    This provides information about the precision and range of Float values.
    
    In NumPy, this would accept different dtypes, but in Lean we work with the built-in Float type.

Specification: numpy.finfo returns floating point type information with correct properties.
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
    Postcondition: The returned FloatInfo has mathematically consistent properties */
