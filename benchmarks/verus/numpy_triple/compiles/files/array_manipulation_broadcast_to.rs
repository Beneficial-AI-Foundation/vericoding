/* Broadcast a 1D vector to a 2D matrix by repeating it along rows.
This implements the most common broadcasting pattern: (n,) -> (m, n)

Specification: broadcast_to creates a 2D matrix where each row is a copy of the input vector.

Mathematical properties:
1. Shape property: The result has shape (m, n) where n is the original vector length
2. Value property: Each row in the result equals the original vector
3. Broadcasting rule: A 1D array of shape (n,) can be broadcast to (m, n) by repeating
4. Row consistency: All rows in the result are identical to the input vector
5. Element preservation: Each element in the input appears m times in each column

Sanity checks:
- The output shape is exactly (m, n)
- Every row contains the same values as the input vector
- Broadcasting preserves element values without modification
- The result behaves as if v was copied m times along a new axis

Example behavior:
- Input: [1, 2, 3] with target shape (2, 3)
- Output: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]

Additional properties:
- Memory efficiency: In NumPy, this creates a view, not a copy
- Column-wise view: Column j contains m copies of v[j]
- Broadcasting compatibility: The result can be used in element-wise operations with other (m, n) arrays

Mathematical formulation:
- For input vector v ∈ ℝⁿ and target shape (m, n)
- Output matrix M ∈ ℝᵐˣⁿ where M[i,j] = v[j] for all i ∈ {0,...,m-1}, j ∈ {0,...,n-1} */
