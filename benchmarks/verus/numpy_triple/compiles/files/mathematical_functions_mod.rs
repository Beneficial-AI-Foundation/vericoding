/* numpy.mod: Returns the element-wise remainder of division.

Computes the remainder complementary to the floor_divide function.
This is equivalent to x1 % x2 in terms of array broadcasting.

The result has the same sign as the divisor x2.
For two arguments of floating point type, the result is:
x1 - floor(x1/x2) * x2

Specification: numpy.mod returns a vector where each element is the remainder
of the corresponding elements from x1 and x2.

Precondition: All elements in x2 must be non-zero
Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = x1[i] % x2[i]

Mathematical properties:
1. The result has the same sign as x2[i] (when x2[i] â‰  0)
2. The absolute value of result[i] is less than the absolute value of x2[i]
3. x1[i] = floor(x1[i] / x2[i]) * x2[i] + result[i] */
