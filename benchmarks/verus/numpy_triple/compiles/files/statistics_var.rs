The variance is computed for the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.\n\nParameters\n----------\na : array_like\n    Array containing numbers whose variance is desired. If a is not an array, a conversion is attempted.\naxis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional\n    Axis or axes along which the variance is computed. The default is to compute the variance of the flattened array.\ndtype : data-type, optional\n    Type to use in computing the variance. For arrays of integer type the default is float64; for arrays of float types it is the same as the array type.\nout : ndarray, optional\n    Alternate output array in which to place the result. It must have the same shape as the expected output.\nddof : int, optional\n    \"Delta Degrees of Freedom\": the divisor used in the calculation is N - ddof, where N represents the number of elements. By default ddof is zero.\nkeepdims : bool, optional\n    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one.\nwhere : array_like of bool, optional\n    Elements to include in the variance.\n\nReturns\n-------\nvariance : ndarray, see dtype parameter above\n    If out=None, returns a new array containing the variance; otherwise, a reference to the output array is returned.\n\nNotes\n-----\nThe variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean, i.e., var = mean(x - x.mean())**2.\n\nThe mean is typically calculated as x.sum() / N, where N = len(x). If, however, ddof is specified, the divisor N - ddof is used instead. In standard statistical practice, ddof=1 provides an unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite population. ddof=0 provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables.",

/*  Compute the variance of the elements in a vector with specified delta degrees of freedom.
    The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean. */

/*  Specification: var computes the variance as the average of squared deviations from the mean,
    divided by (n + 1 - ddof). The variance measures the spread of a distribution.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. The result is always non-negative
    2. The variance is zero if and only if all elements are equal
    3. The computation requires ddof < n + 1 to ensure a positive divisor
    4. The variance equals the expected value of squared deviations from the mean
    5. Translation invariance: var(a + c) = var(a) for any constant c
    6. Scaling property: var(c * a) = c^2 * var(a) for any constant c
    
    The variance formula implemented is:
    var = (1/(n+1-ddof)) * sum_{i=0}^{n} (a[i] - mean)^2
    where mean = (1/(n+1)) * sum_{i=0}^{n} a[i]
    
    This specification captures both the mathematical definition of variance
    and its key properties. When ddof=0, this gives the population variance;
    when ddof=1, this gives the sample variance (unbiased estimator). */
