/* numpy.strings.translate: For each element in a, return a copy of the string where 
all characters occurring in deletechars are removed, and the remaining characters 
have been mapped through the given translation table.

This function performs character-level transformation on byte strings by first
removing characters specified in deletechars, then translating each remaining
character using a 256-byte translation table.

Specification for numpy.strings.translate: Returns a vector where each element is 
the result of character deletion followed by character translation.

Mathematical Properties:
1. Element-wise transformation: Each result element is derived from the corresponding input
2. Two-stage process: First deletion, then translation
3. Deletion completeness: All occurrences of characters in deletechars are removed
4. Translation mapping: Each remaining byte is mapped through the translation table
5. Order preservation: Relative order of non-deleted characters is maintained
6. Empty string handling: Empty strings remain empty after transformation */
