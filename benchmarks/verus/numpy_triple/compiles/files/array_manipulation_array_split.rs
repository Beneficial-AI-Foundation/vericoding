/* Split a vector into k sub-vectors.
    
When splitting a vector of length n into k sections:
- The first (n % k) sub-vectors have size ⌈n/k⌉ = (n + k - 1) / k
- The remaining sub-vectors have size ⌊n/k⌋ = n / k

This ensures all elements are distributed as evenly as possible,
with larger sub-vectors appearing first.

Specification: array_split distributes elements evenly with mathematical properties
    
The specification captures:
1. Size distribution: larger chunks come first
2. Element preservation: all elements from the original vector appear in order
3. No gaps or overlaps: elements are contiguously distributed */
