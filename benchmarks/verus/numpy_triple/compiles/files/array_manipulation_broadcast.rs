/* numpy.broadcast: Produce an object that mimics broadcasting between two vectors.
    
This simplified version handles broadcasting between a column vector (m × 1)
and a row vector (1 × n), producing an object that represents the m × n
broadcast result.
    
The broadcast object allows iteration over all element pairs that would
result from the broadcasting operation.

Specification: broadcast creates an object that correctly pairs elements
according to NumPy broadcasting rules.
    
For a column vector x of shape (m, 1) and row vector y of shape (1, n),
the broadcast object has shape (m, n) and element (i, j) is the pair (x[i], y[j]).
    
Preconditions: 
- m > 0 (x is non-empty)
- n > 0 (y is non-empty)
    
Postconditions:
- The resulting shape is (m, n)
- Element at position (i, j) is the pair (x[i], y[j]) */
