/* numpy.exp: Calculate the exponential of all elements in the input array.

Computes the exponential function (e^x) element-wise. This is the inverse
of the natural logarithm function. For each element x in the input array,
the result contains e^x where e is Euler's number (approximately 2.71828).

The exponential function has the mathematical property that exp(x + y) = exp(x) * exp(y)
and exp(0) = 1.

Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the exponential values.

Specification: numpy.exp returns a vector where each element is the
exponential (e^x) of the corresponding element in x.

Precondition: True (exponential function is defined for all real numbers)
Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = e^(x[i])

Mathematical properties:
- exp(0) = 1 for any zero elements
- exp(x) > 0 for all x (exponential is always positive)
- exp is monotonically increasing
- exp(x + y) = exp(x) * exp(y) (for addition in the input) */
