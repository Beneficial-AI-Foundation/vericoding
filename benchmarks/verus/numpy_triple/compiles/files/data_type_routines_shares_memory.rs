/* Determine if two arrays share memory

This function determines if two arrays share memory by checking
if they reference the same underlying memory locations.

Unlike may_share_memory, this function provides a definitive answer
about memory sharing rather than a conservative estimate.

The function can be exponentially slow for some inputs due to the
complexity of the overlap detection algorithm.

Specification: shares_memory returns a boolean indicating whether two arrays actually share memory.

Precondition: True (no special preconditions needed)
Postcondition: The function returns a boolean value that accurately reflects memory sharing.
If the arrays are identical references, it must return True.
If the arrays are independent (non-overlapping memory), it must return False.
The function is precise - it returns True if and only if the arrays share memory. */
