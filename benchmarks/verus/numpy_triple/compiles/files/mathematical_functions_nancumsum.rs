/* numpy.nancumsum: Return the cumulative sum of array elements treating NaN as zero.

For a 1D array, nancumsum computes the cumulative sum where NaN values are treated as zero.
Unlike regular cumsum, NaN values do not propagate and are replaced with zero during computation.

Examples:
- [1, NaN, 3] becomes [1, 1, 4] (NaN treated as 0)
- [NaN, 2, 3] becomes [0, 2, 5] (leading NaN becomes 0)
- [1, 2, NaN, 4] becomes [1, 3, 3, 7] (NaN contributes 0 to sum)

The cumulative sum with NaN handling is defined as:
- result[0] = if a[0].isNaN then 0 else a[0]
- result[i] = result[i-1] + (if a[i].isNaN then 0 else a[i]) for i > 0

Specification: nancumsum returns a vector where each element is the cumulative sum
up to that position with NaN values treated as zero.

Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
Postcondition:
- Result has the same length as input
- NaN values are treated as zero in the cumulative sum computation
- For non-empty vectors, first element is either a[0] or 0 if a[0] is NaN
- Each subsequent element is the previous cumulative sum plus current element (or 0 if NaN)
- The cumulative sum preserves the NaN-as-zero semantics throughout */
