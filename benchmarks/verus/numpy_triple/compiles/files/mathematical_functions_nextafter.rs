/* numpy.nextafter: Return the next floating-point value after x1 towards x2, element-wise.
    
Returns the next representable floating-point value after x1 in the direction of x2.
This function is essential for numerical computing and provides fine-grained control
over floating-point precision. It's based on the C math library's nextafter function.

For each element pair (x1[i], x2[i]):
- If x1[i] == x2[i], returns x1[i]
- If x1[i] < x2[i], returns the smallest floating-point value greater than x1[i]
- If x1[i] > x2[i], returns the largest floating-point value less than x1[i]

Special cases:
- nextafter(x, +∞) returns the next value towards positive infinity
- nextafter(x, -∞) returns the next value towards negative infinity
- nextafter(±∞, y) returns ±∞ for any finite y
- nextafter(NaN, y) or nextafter(x, NaN) returns NaN

This function is crucial for:
- Numerical differentiation algorithms
- Root finding methods requiring precise stepping
- Testing floating-point precision limits
- Implementing robust numerical algorithms

Specification: numpy.nextafter returns a vector where each element is the next
representable floating-point value after x1[i] in the direction of x2[i].

Precondition: True (no special preconditions for nextafter)
Postcondition: For all indices i:
  - If x1[i] == x2[i], then result[i] = x1[i]
  - If x1[i] < x2[i], then result[i] is the smallest float greater than x1[i]
  - If x1[i] > x2[i], then result[i] is the largest float less than x1[i]

Mathematical properties:
  1. Direction consistency: result[i] moves towards x2[i]
  2. Monotonicity: if x1[i] < x2[i], then x1[i] < result[i] ≤ x2[i]
  3. Minimal step: result[i] is the closest representable value to x1[i] in direction of x2[i]
  4. Symmetry: nextafter(nextafter(x, y), x) moves back towards x
  5. Identity: nextafter(x, x) = x
  6. Finite precision: respects IEEE 754 floating-point representation */
