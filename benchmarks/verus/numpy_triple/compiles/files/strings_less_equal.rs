/* numpy.strings.less_equal: Return the truth value of (x1 <= x2) element-wise for string arrays.

    Performs element-wise string comparison between two vectors of strings.
    Returns a boolean vector indicating whether each string in x1 is lexicographically 
    less than or equal to the corresponding string in x2.
    
    This function compares strings lexicographically and returns True for each
    position where x1[i] <= x2[i], False otherwise.
*/

/* Specification: numpy.strings.less_equal returns element-wise less-than-or-equal comparison.

    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for string comparison)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = (x1[i] <= x2[i])
    
    Mathematical Properties:
    - Reflexive: less_equal x x returns all True (x <= x is always true)
    - Antisymmetric: if less_equal x y and less_equal y x are both True, then equal x y is True
    - Transitive: if less_equal x y and less_equal y z are both True, then less_equal x z is True
    - Total order: for any x, y either less_equal x y or less_equal y x (or both)
    - Consistency with equality: if x = y, then less_equal x y = True
    - Decidable: String comparison is decidable for all strings
    - Type-safe: Result vector has same length as input vectors
    - Lexicographic ordering: String comparison follows lexicographic ordering
