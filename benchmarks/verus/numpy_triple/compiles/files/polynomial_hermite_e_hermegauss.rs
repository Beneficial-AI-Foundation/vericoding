/* numpy.polynomial.hermite_e.hermegauss: Gauss-HermiteE quadrature.

Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-HermiteE quadrature.
These sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of
degree 2*deg - 1 or less over the interval [-∞, ∞] with the weight
function f(x) = exp(-x²/2).

The function returns a pair (x, w) where x contains the sample points
and w contains the corresponding weights.

Specification: hermegauss returns quadrature points and weights for HermiteE polynomials.

Precondition: deg > 0 (need at least one quadrature point)
Postcondition: The returned points and weights satisfy the mathematical properties
of Gauss-HermiteE quadrature including positivity, symmetry, and ordering. */
