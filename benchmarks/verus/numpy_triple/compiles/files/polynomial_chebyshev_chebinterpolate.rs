/* numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebinterpolate: Interpolate a function at the Chebyshev points of the first kind.
   
   Returns the Chebyshev series coefficients that interpolate the given function
   at the Chebyshev points of the first kind in the interval [-1, 1]. The resulting
   coefficients represent a polynomial of degree deg that interpolates the function
   at deg+1 Chebyshev points.
   
   The Chebyshev interpolation provides near-optimal polynomial approximation
   for continuous functions on [-1, 1], minimizing the Runge phenomenon and
   providing good convergence properties.
*/

/* Specification: chebinterpolate returns Chebyshev coefficients c such that:
   1. The coefficients form a vector of length deg + 1
   2. When evaluated as a Chebyshev polynomial at the Chebyshev points of the
      first kind, it exactly reproduces the function values at those points
   3. The interpolation is exact at the Chebyshev points: for each Chebyshev
      point x_k = cos(π * k / deg) where k ∈ {0, ..., deg}, the Chebyshev
      polynomial with coefficients c evaluates to func(x_k)
   
   Mathematical properties:
   - The Chebyshev points of the first kind are x_k = cos(π * k / deg) for k = 0, ..., deg
   - The interpolation minimizes the maximum error among all polynomial interpolations
   - For continuous functions, the interpolation converges uniformly as deg increases
   - The coefficients are computed using the discrete cosine transform of the
     function values at the Chebyshev points
   
   Precondition: deg < 1000 (reasonable bound for practical use)
   Postcondition: The returned coefficients satisfy the interpolation property
                  at all Chebyshev points of the first kind
