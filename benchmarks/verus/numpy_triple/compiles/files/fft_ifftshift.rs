/* The inverse of fftshift - undoes the frequency domain shifting.
    
This function performs the inverse operation of fftshift, moving the 
zero-frequency component from the center back to the beginning of the array.
For even-length arrays, it is identical to fftshift.
For odd-length arrays, it differs by one sample position.

The function performs a circular shift by -(n/2) positions.

Specification: ifftshift performs the inverse of fftshift.
    
The function performs a circular shift that undoes the centering of 
the zero-frequency component:
- For even n: shifts by -(n/2), identical to fftshift
- For odd n: shifts by -(n/2), which differs from fftshift by one sample

This ensures that:
- Elements from the center move back to the beginning
- The DC component at the center returns to index 0
- The function is the left inverse of fftshift

Mathematical properties:
- For even-length arrays: ifftshift(fftshift(x)) = x and fftshift(ifftshift(x)) = x
- For odd-length arrays: ifftshift(fftshift(x)) = x but fftshift(ifftshift(x)) â‰  x
- Preserves the total energy/sum of the array
- Is a bijection (permutation) of array elements

The specification states that each element at position i in the result
comes from position (i + n/2) % n in the input, which is equivalent
to a circular left shift by n/2 positions (or right shift by n - n/2). */
