/* Generate a Hermite series with given roots.
    
Returns the coefficients of the polynomial p(x) = (x - r₀) * (x - r₁) * ... * (x - rₙ)
in Hermite form. If a zero has multiplicity n, it must appear n times in the roots vector.
    
The resulting polynomial is expressed as: p(x) = c₀ + c₁ * H₁(x) + ... + cₙ * Hₙ(x)
where Hᵢ(x) are Hermite polynomials.

Specification: hermfromroots generates Hermite coefficients such that:
1. The result has length n+1 where n is the number of roots
2. The polynomial has exactly the given roots (when evaluated using Hermite polynomials)
3. The leading coefficient is non-zero (for non-empty roots)
4. For repeated roots, the multiplicity is preserved */
