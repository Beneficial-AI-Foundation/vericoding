vc-description: |-
  Return the scaled companion matrix of c.

  The basis polynomials are scaled so that the companion matrix is
  symmetric when `c` is an Hermite basis polynomial. This provides
  better eigenvalue estimates than the unscaled case and for basis
  polynomials the eigenvalues are guaranteed to be real if
  `numpy.linalg.eigvalsh` is used to obtain them.

  Parameters
  ----------
  c : array_like
      1-D array of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to high
      degree.

  Returns
  -------
  mat : ndarray
      Scaled companion matrix of dimensions (deg, deg).

  Return the scaled companion matrix of Hermite polynomial coefficients.
  The companion matrix is symmetric when c represents a Hermite basis polynomial.

  Specification: hermcompanion produces a scaled companion matrix with specific properties.
  For a coefficient vector of length n+2, the result is an (n+1)Ã—(n+1) matrix where:
  1. The super-diagonal and sub-diagonal contain sqrt(k/2) for k = 1 to n
  2. The last column is adjusted by scaled coefficients
  3. The matrix is symmetric when c represents a Hermite basis polynomial
