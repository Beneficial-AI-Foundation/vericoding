vc-description: |-
  Subtract one Hermite series from another.
  Returns the difference of two Hermite series c1 - c2.
  The sequences of coefficients are from lowest order term to highest.
  
  Specification: hermesub performs component-wise subtraction of Hermite series coefficients.
  The result has length equal to the maximum of the input lengths, with shorter arrays
  implicitly padded with zeros. This captures the mathematical property that polynomial 
  subtraction is component-wise and preserves the polynomial structure.
