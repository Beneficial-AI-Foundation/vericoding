  /*  numpy.memmap: Create a memory-map to an array stored in a binary file on disk.
  
      Memory-mapped files are used for accessing small segments of large files
      on disk, without reading the entire file into memory. The memmap provides
      an array-like interface to the file contents.
  
      This function creates a Vector view into a binary file on disk with the
      specified shape and access mode. The file is accessed starting at the
      given offset.
  */
  
  /*  Specification: numpy.memmap creates a memory-mapped view of a file.
  
      This specification captures the essential properties of memory mapping:
      1. The result is a valid vector of the specified size
      2. The mapping respects the file access mode constraints
      3. The offset is within valid bounds for the file
      4. Read-only modes preserve data integrity
      5. Write modes allow modification of the underlying file
  
      Preconditions:
      - The filename represents a valid file path
      - The offset is non-negative and within the file bounds
      - For WriteNew mode, the file will be created if it doesn't exist
      - For ReadOnly mode, the file must exist and be readable
  
      Postconditions:
      - Returns a vector of the specified size n
      - The vector provides a view into the file starting at the given offset
      - Read operations reflect the file contents at the mapped region
      - Write operations (when mode allows) modify the underlying file
      - The mapping preserves the mathematical properties of array access
