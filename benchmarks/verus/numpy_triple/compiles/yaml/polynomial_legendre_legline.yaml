vc-description: |-
  Creates a Legendre series representation of a straight line `off + scl*x`.
  
  This function generates the correct Legendre series coefficients for a linear function.
  The Legendre series whose graph is a straight line is represented as a vector
  where the coefficients correspond to the linear polynomial off + scl*x.
  
  Parameters:
  - off, scl: scalars representing the line off + scl*x
  
  Returns:
  - A vector of Float values representing the Legendre series coefficients
  
  The specification ensures that the resulting coefficients correctly represent
  the linear function.
