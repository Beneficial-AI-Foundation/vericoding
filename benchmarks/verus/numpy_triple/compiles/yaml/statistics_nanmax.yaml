If a is not an array, a conversion is attempted.\naxis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional\n    Axis or axes along which the maximum is computed. The default is to compute the maximum of the flattened array.\nout : ndarray, optional\n    Alternate output array in which to place the result. The default is None; if provided, it must have the same shape as the expected output.\nkeepdims : bool, optional\n    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one.\ninitial : scalar, optional\n    The minimum value of an output element. Must be present to allow computation on empty slice.\nwhere : array_like of bool, optional\n    Elements to compare for the maximum.\n\nReturns\n-------\nnanmax : ndarray\n    An array with the same shape as a, with the specified axis removed. If a is a 0-d array, or if axis is None, an ndarray scalar is returned.",

  /* Returns the maximum value of all elements in a non-empty vector, ignoring NaN values.
     When all elements are NaN, returns NaN.
     
     Mathematical Properties:
     - Ignores NaN values in the computation
     - Returns the maximum of all non-NaN elements
     - If all elements are NaN, returns NaN
     - If at least one element is not NaN, returns the maximum non-NaN value
     - For vectors with no NaN values, behaves identically to regular max */
  
  /* Specification: nanmax returns the maximum value in the vector, ignoring NaN values.
     
     Mathematical properties:
     1. If there exists at least one non-NaN element, the result is the maximum among non-NaN elements
     2. If all elements are NaN, the result is NaN
     3. The result is either a non-NaN element from the vector or NaN
     4. For vectors without NaN values, nanmax behaves identically to regular max
     5. NaN values are completely ignored during the maximum computation
     6. Sanity check: result is either NaN or exists in the vector */
