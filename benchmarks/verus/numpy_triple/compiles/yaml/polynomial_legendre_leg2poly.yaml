vc-description: |-
  Convert a Legendre series to a polynomial (monomial basis)
  
  Specification: leg2poly converts Legendre series coefficients to polynomial coefficients
  
  This function converts an array representing the coefficients of a Legendre series,
  ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an array of the coefficients
  of the equivalent polynomial (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered
  from lowest to highest degree.
