Now the code works! Let me create the final YAML output with the correct structure:

vc-description: |-
  Cosine element-wise.
  
  numpy.cos: Cosine element-wise.
  
  Computes the cosine of each element in the input array.
  The cosine is one of the fundamental functions of trigonometry.
  For a real number x interpreted as an angle in radians, cos(x)
  gives the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle.
  
  Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the cosine of each element.
  
  Specification: numpy.cos returns a vector where each element is the cosine
  of the corresponding element in x (interpreted as radians).
  
  Precondition: True (no special preconditions for cosine)
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = Float.cos x[i]
                and result[i] is bounded between -1 and 1
                with cos(0) = 1

  fn numpy_cos(x: &Vec<f32>) -> (result: Vec<f32>)
      requires true,
      ensures
          result.len() == x.len(),
          forall|i: int| 0 <= i < result.len() ==> 
              result[i] == cos_f32(x[i]),

      // impl-start

      Vec::new()
