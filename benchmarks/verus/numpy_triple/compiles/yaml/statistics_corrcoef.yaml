  /* numpy.corrcoef: Return Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients.

     The correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two variables.
     For two vectors x and y, the correlation coefficient is computed as:
     
     corr(x, y) = cov(x, y) / (std(x) * std(y))
     
     Where:
     - cov(x, y) is the covariance between x and y
     - std(x) and std(y) are the standard deviations of x and y
     
     This function computes the correlation coefficient between two vectors of observations.
     The result is bounded between -1 and 1, where:
     - 1 indicates perfect positive correlation
     - -1 indicates perfect negative correlation  
     - 0 indicates no linear correlation
     
     Requires non-empty vectors and non-zero variance in both variables.
  */
  
  /* Specification: corrcoef computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between two vectors.

     The correlation coefficient satisfies several mathematical properties:
     1. Symmetry: corr(x, y) = corr(y, x)
     2. Bounded: -1 ≤ corr(x, y) ≤ 1
     3. Self-correlation: corr(x, x) = 1 (if x has non-zero variance)
     4. Scale invariance: correlation is preserved under linear transformations
     
     Precondition: Both vectors have non-zero variance (not all elements equal)
     Postcondition: Result is bounded between -1 and 1, and captures linear relationship
