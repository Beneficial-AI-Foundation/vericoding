  proof fn NPY_PI_2_spec()
      /* 
      The original Lean specification with floating-point constraints cannot be directly
      translated to Verus due to limitations in floating-point reasoning. The constraints were:
      - π/2 is approximately 1.5708...
      - Basic sanity check: π/2 is between 1 and 2
      - π/2 squared is approximately 2.4674...
      - 2*(π/2) should be approximately π (3.14159...)
      - (π/2)/2 = π/4 is approximately 0.7854...
      - 3*(π/2) = 3π/2 is approximately 4.7124... (270 degrees)
      - 4*(π/2) = 2π is approximately 6.2832... (full circle)
