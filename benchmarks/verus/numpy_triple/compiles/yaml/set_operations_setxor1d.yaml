  numpy.setxor1d: Find the set exclusive-or of two arrays.
  
      Return the sorted, unique values that are in only one (not both) of the
      input arrays. This is equivalent to the symmetric difference of two sets.
      
      The result contains elements that appear in ar1 but not in ar2, or in ar2 
      but not in ar1, sorted in ascending order.
  
  Specification: numpy.setxor1d returns the symmetric difference of two arrays.
  
      Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
      Postcondition: 
      1. The result contains only elements that appear in exactly one of the input arrays
      2. The result is sorted in ascending order
      3. The result contains no duplicates
      4. Every element in the result comes from either ar1 or ar2 (but not both)
