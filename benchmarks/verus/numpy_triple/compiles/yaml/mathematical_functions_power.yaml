  numpy.power: First array elements raised to powers from second array, element-wise.

  Raise each base in x1 to the positionally-corresponding power in x2.
  This is equivalent to x1 ** x2 in terms of array broadcasting.
  
  The function computes x1[i] raised to the power x2[i] for each index i.
  
  Mathematical properties:
  - x^0 = 1 for any non-zero x
  - x^1 = x for any x
  - x^(a+b) = x^a * x^b for any x, a, b
  - (x^a)^b = x^(a*b) for any x, a, b

  Specification: numpy.power returns a vector where each element is the base
  from x1 raised to the power from x2.

  Precondition: For mathematical validity, we require:
  - If x1[i] = 0, then x2[i] ≥ 0 (0^negative is undefined)
  - If x1[i] < 0, then x2[i] should be an integer (for real results, checked by floor = value)
  
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = x1[i] ^ x2[i]
  
  Key mathematical properties ensured:
  1. Identity: If x2[i] = 0 and x1[i] ≠ 0, then result[i] = 1
  2. Base case: If x2[i] = 1, then result[i] = x1[i]
  3. Monotonicity: If x1[i] > 1 and x2[i] > 0, then result[i] > x1[i]
