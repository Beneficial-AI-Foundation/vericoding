  /*  
  Solve the tensor equation a x = b for x.
  
  This function solves for x in the tensor equation a x = b, where:
  - a is a coefficient tensor that can be reshaped to a square matrix
  - b is the right-hand tensor  
  - x is the solution tensor
  
  For simplicity, we model this as solving a square linear system where the 
  coefficient matrix a is reshaped from tensor form to a 2D matrix, and the 
  solution is reshaped back to tensor form.

  /*  
  Specification: tensorsolve solves the tensor equation a x = b for x.
  
  This specification captures the mathematical properties of tensor equation solving:
  
  1. **Correctness**: The solution x satisfies the matrix equation a x = b
  2. **Invertibility**: The coefficient matrix a must be invertible
  3. **Uniqueness**: The solution is unique when a is invertible
  
  The specification handles the basic case where:
  - a is an n√ón coefficient matrix (representing a reshaped tensor)
  - b is an n-dimensional right-hand vector
  - x is the n-dimensional solution vector
