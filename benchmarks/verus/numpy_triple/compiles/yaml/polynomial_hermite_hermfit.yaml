vc-description: |-
  Least squares fit of Hermite series to data. Returns coefficients of a Hermite polynomial
  that best fits the given data points (x, y) with degree deg.

  Specification: hermfit returns coefficients that minimize the least squares error
  for a Hermite polynomial fit of the given degree to the data points

  fn hermfit(x: &Vec<f64>, y: &Vec<f64>, deg: usize) -> (result: Vec<f64>)
      requires 
          x.len() == y.len(),
          x.len() > 0,
          deg >= 0,
      ensures
          result.len() == deg + 1,
          deg + 1 > 0,
          /* The coefficients minimize the squared error
           * Let H_k(x) be the k-th Hermite polynomial evaluated at x
           * The fitted polynomial is p(x) = sum_{k=0}^{deg} coef[k] * H_k(x)
           * 
           * The least squares property: for any other coefficient vector c' of the same size,
           * the sum of squared errors with coef is less than or equal to that with c'
           * 
           * Mathematical property: The solution satisfies the normal equations
           * V^T * V * coef = V^T * y
           * where V is the Vandermonde matrix of Hermite polynomials evaluated at x
           * 
           * Additional properties:
           * 1. If m >= deg + 1, the fit is unique (assuming full rank)
           * 2. If m = deg + 1 and points are distinct, the polynomial interpolates exactly
           * 3. The coefficients are real-valued (no complex numbers in this spec)
