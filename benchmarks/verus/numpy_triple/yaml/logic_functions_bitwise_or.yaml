  numpy.bitwise_or: Compute the bit-wise OR of two arrays element-wise.
  
  Computes the bit-wise OR of the underlying binary representation of
  the integers in the input arrays. This ufunc implements the C/Python
  operator |.
  
  For integer inputs, the result is the bitwise OR of the binary
  representations. For boolean inputs, it performs logical OR.
  
  Specification: numpy.bitwise_or returns a vector where each element is the 
  bitwise OR of the corresponding elements from x1 and x2.
  
  Precondition: True (no special preconditions for bitwise OR)
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = bitwise_or(x1[i], x2[i])
  
  Mathematical properties:
  - Commutative: bitwise_or(x1[i], x2[i]) = bitwise_or(x2[i], x1[i])
  - Identity: bitwise_or(x[i], 0) = x[i]
  - Idempotent: bitwise_or(x[i], x[i]) = x[i]
  
  /* Axiomatically define bitwise OR operation for integers */
  
  /* Bitwise OR is commutative */
  
  /* Bitwise OR with zero is identity */
  
  /* Bitwise OR is idempotent */
