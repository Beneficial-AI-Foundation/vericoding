  numpy.full_like: Return a full array with the same shape and type as a given array.
  
  Creates a new array with the same shape as the input array `a`, where all
  elements are set to the specified `fill_value`. This is useful for creating
  arrays of a specific constant value while preserving the shape of an existing
  array.
  
  The actual type of fill_value will be cast to match the array's type,
  similar to numpy's behavior where 0.1 becomes 0 for integer arrays.
  
  Specification: numpy.full_like returns a vector with the same shape as `a`
  where every element equals `fill_value`.
  
  Precondition: True (no special preconditions needed)
  Postcondition: The result has the same length as `a` and all elements equal `fill_value`
