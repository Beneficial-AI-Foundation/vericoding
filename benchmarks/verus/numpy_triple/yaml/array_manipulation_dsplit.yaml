vc-description: |-
  Split a 1D vector into equal sections (simplified version of dsplit).
  
  Since dsplit operates on the 3rd axis of 3D arrays, this simplified version
  demonstrates the splitting behavior on a 1D vector. The actual dsplit would
  work on nested Vector structures representing 3D arrays.
  
  This function divides a vector into k equal sections, where k must divide
  the length of the vector evenly. Returns a list of vectors.
  
  Specification: dsplit divides a vector into equal sections.
  
  Precondition: sections = k and k > 0 (array size must be k * n)
  Postcondition: Returns k sub-vectors, each of size n. The i-th sub-vector
                 contains elements from positions i*n to (i+1)*n-1 of the 
                 original array.
  
  Mathematical property: Concatenating all sub-vectors in order reconstructs
                        the original vector.
