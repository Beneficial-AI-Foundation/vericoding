  numpy.frexp: Decompose the elements of x into mantissa and twos exponent.
  
  Returns (mantissa, exponent), where x = mantissa * 2**exponent.
  The mantissa is in the range [0.5, 1) for positive numbers, (-1, -0.5] for negative numbers,
  or 0 if x is 0. The exponent is an integer.
  
  For special values:
  - If x is 0, returns (0.0, 0)
  - If x is infinity, returns (infinity, 0)
  - If x is NaN, returns (NaN, 0)
  
  Specification: frexp decomposes each element into mantissa and exponent such that
  x = mantissa * 2^exponent, where the mantissa is normalized to be in [0.5, 1) for
  positive values or (-1, -0.5] for negative values.
  
  Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
  Postcondition: For all indices i:
  - If x[i] = 0, then mantissa[i] = 0 and exponent[i] = 0
  - If x[i] is finite and non-zero, then:
    - x[i] = mantissa[i] * 2^exponent[i] (reconstruction property)
    - 0.5 â‰¤ |mantissa[i]| < 1.0 (normalization property)
    - mantissa[i] has same sign as x[i] (sign preservation)
  - If x[i] is infinity or NaN, then mantissa[i] = x[i] and exponent[i] = 0
  - Result vectors have same length as input (length preservation)
  
  /* Zero case: if input is zero, mantissa is zero and exponent is zero */
  
  /* Note: More complex properties like reconstruction (x = mantissa * 2^exponent),
                 normalization bounds, and sign preservation would require additional
                 floating-point operations that are not readily available in Verus specs */
