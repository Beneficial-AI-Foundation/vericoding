  numpy.cross: Return the cross product of two (arrays of) vectors.
  
  The cross product of a and b in R^3 is a vector perpendicular to both a and b.
  For 3D vectors a = [a0, a1, a2] and b = [b0, b1, b2], the cross product is:
  c = [a1*b2 - a2*b1, a2*b0 - a0*b2, a0*b1 - a1*b0]
  
  This implementation focuses on the 3D case, which is the most common usage.
  The result vector is perpendicular to both input vectors according to the
  right-hand rule.
  
  Specification: numpy.cross returns the cross product of two 3D vectors.
  
  Precondition: True (vectors must be 3D, enforced by type)
  Postcondition: 
  1. The result components follow the cross product formula
  2. The result is perpendicular to both input vectors (dot product is zero)
  3. Anti-commutativity: a × b = -(b × a)
  4. Bilinearity properties
  5. Zero property: if a and b are parallel, then a × b = 0
