  Euler's number is the base of the natural logarithm. It is the unique number whose natural logarithm is equal to one.
  
  Specification: e is Euler's constant with mathematical properties:
  1. It is approximately 2.718281828459045
  2. It is the unique positive real number such that ln(e) = 1
  3. It is the limit of (1 + 1/n)^n as n approaches infinity
  4. It satisfies the property that the derivative of e^x equals e^x
  5. It is the sum of the infinite series 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + ...
