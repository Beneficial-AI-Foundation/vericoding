vc-description: |-
  Create a new 1-dimensional array from an iterable object.
  Takes the first n elements from the iterable sequence and creates a Vector.
  This models numpy.fromiter with explicit count parameter.
  
  Specification: fromiter creates a Vector containing the first n elements 
  from the iterable in order. The resulting Vector has exactly n elements,
  and each element at index i equals the i-th element from the iterable.

  fn fromiter<T: Copy>(n: usize, iter: spec_fn(usize) -> T) -> (result: Vec<T>)
      ensures
          result.len() == n,
          forall|i: int| 0 <= i < n ==> result[i] == iter(i as usize)
