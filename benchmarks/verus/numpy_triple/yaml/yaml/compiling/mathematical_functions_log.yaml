  numpy.log: Natural logarithm, element-wise.

  The natural logarithm log is the inverse of the exponential function,
  so that log(exp(x)) = x. The natural logarithm is logarithm base e.

  Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the natural logarithm
  of each element in x.

  Note: The domain of the natural logarithm is the positive real numbers.
  Mathematically, log(x) is undefined for x ≤ 0.

  Specification: log returns a vector where each element is the natural
  logarithm of the corresponding element in x.

  Precondition: All elements must be positive (x[i] > 0)
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = log(x[i])

  Mathematical properties:
  - log is the inverse of exp: log(exp(x)) = x
  - log(1) = 0
  - log(e) = 1
  - log(x*y) = log(x) + log(y) for positive x, y
  - log is strictly increasing on (0, ∞)
