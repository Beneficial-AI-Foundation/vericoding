  Compute the q-th percentile of the data in a vector.
  For a sorted vector, the q-th percentile is the value below which q percent of the data falls.
  This implementation focuses on the fundamental mathematical definition of percentiles.
  
  Specification: percentile computes the q-th percentile value correctly.
  The percentile is defined as the value v such that at least q% of the data
  is less than or equal to v, and at least (100-q)% of the data is greater than or equal to v.
  
  Mathematical properties:
  1. The percentile value must be within the range of the data (or interpolated between values)
  2. Special cases: q=0 gives minimum, q=100 gives maximum
  3. The result is bounded by the minimum and maximum values in the array
