Great! Now the code verifies. Let me provide the complete YAML output with the fixed Verus translation:

vc-description: |-
  /*
  numpy.polynomial.hermite_e.hermevander: Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degree.
  
  Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degree `deg` and sample points
  `x`. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by
  
  .. math:: V[..., i] = He_i(x),
  
  where ``0 <= i <= deg``. The leading indices of `V` index the elements of
  `x` and the last index is the degree of the HermiteE polynomial.
  
  If `c` is a 1-D array of coefficients of length ``n + 1`` and `V` is the
  array ``V = hermevander(x, n)``, then ``np.dot(V, c)`` and
  ``hermeval(x, c)`` are the same up to roundoff. This equivalence is
  useful both for least squares fitting and for the evaluation of a large
  number of HermiteE series of the same degree and sample points.
  
  Parameters
  ----------
  x : array_like
      Array of points. The dtype is converted to float64 or complex128
      depending on whether any of the elements are complex. If `x` is
      scalar it is converted to a 1-D array.
  deg : int
      Degree of the resulting matrix.
  
  Returns
  -------
  vander : ndarray
      The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix. The shape of the returned matrix is
      ``x.shape + (deg + 1,)``, where The last index is the degree of the
      corresponding HermiteE polynomial.  The dtype will be the same as
      the converted `x`.
  
  Specification: hermevander returns a pseudo-Vandermonde matrix where each row
  corresponds to a point in x, and each column corresponds to a HermiteE polynomial
  of degree 0 through deg evaluated at that point.
  
  The HermiteE polynomials (also called probabilist's Hermite polynomials) are
  defined by the recurrence relation:
  - He_0(x) = 1
  - He_1(x) = x  
  - He_n(x) = x * He_{n-1}(x) - (n-1) * He_{n-2}(x)
  
  Precondition: True (no special preconditions needed)
  Postcondition: 
  1. The matrix has shape (n, deg + 1)
  2. For each row i and column j, V[i][j] = He_j(x[i])
  3. First column is all ones (He_0(x) = 1)
  4. Second column equals x (He_1(x) = x) when deg > 0
  5. Subsequent columns follow the HermiteE recurrence relation
