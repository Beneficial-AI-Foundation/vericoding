  numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebcompanion: Return the scaled companion matrix of c.

  The basis polynomials are scaled so that the companion matrix is
  symmetric when c is a Chebyshev basis polynomial. This provides
  better eigenvalue estimates than the unscaled case and for basis
  polynomials the eigenvalues are guaranteed to be real if
  numpy.linalg.eigvalsh is used to obtain them.

  Parameters:
  - c : 1-D array of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to high degree

  Returns:
  - mat : Scaled companion matrix of dimensions (deg, deg) where deg = len(c) - 1

  Specification: chebcompanion returns a scaled companion matrix with specific structure.

  Precondition: The input vector has at least 2 elements (enforced by type)
  
  Postcondition: The result is an (n+1) Ã— (n+1) matrix where:
  1. The superdiagonal and subdiagonal have specific values (0.5 for most entries, sqrt(0.5) for the first)
  2. The last column is adjusted by scaled coefficients
  3. The matrix structure ensures symmetry for Chebyshev basis polynomials
