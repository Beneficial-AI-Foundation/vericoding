  /*
  Chebyshev points of the second kind.
      
  Generates n Chebyshev points of the second kind, which are the values
  cos(π*k/(n-1)) for k from 0 to n-1, sorted in ascending order.
  These points are the extrema and endpoints of the Chebyshev polynomial T_{n-1}.
  
  Specification: chebpts2 generates Chebyshev points of the second kind
      
  The function returns n points where:
  1. Each point is cos(π*k/(n-1)) for k from n-1 down to 0
  2. The points are sorted in ascending order
  3. The first point is -1 and the last point is 1
  4. The points are symmetric around 0 for the transformation x ↦ -x
