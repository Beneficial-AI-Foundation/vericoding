vc-description: |-
  Create a 1D open grid from start to stop with n evenly spaced points.
  This is a simplified version of ogrid that handles the common case of
  creating a single evenly-spaced vector (like ogrid[start:stop:nj]).
  
  Specification: ogrid creates n evenly spaced points from start to stop (inclusive).
  When n > 1, the spacing between consecutive points is (stop - start) / (n - 1).
  For n = 1, the single point is at start.
