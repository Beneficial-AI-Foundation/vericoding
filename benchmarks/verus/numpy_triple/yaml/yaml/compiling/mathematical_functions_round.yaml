Perfect! Now I can provide the correct YAML output:

vc-description: |-
  /*
  Evenly round to the given number of decimals.
  
  numpy.round: Evenly round to the given number of decimals.
  
  Rounds each element of the input array to the given number of decimal places.
  Uses "banker's rounding" (round half to even) for ties.
  
  For decimals=0: rounds to nearest integer
  For decimals>0: rounds to that many decimal places
  For decimals<0: rounds to nearest 10^(-decimals)
  
  Returns an array of the same shape as input, containing the rounded values.
  
  Specification: numpy.round rounds each element to the specified number of decimal places.
  
  Precondition: True (rounding is defined for all real numbers and decimal places)
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] is the rounded value of a[i] to 'decimals' places:
  - For decimals = 0: result[i] is the nearest integer to a[i]
  - For decimals > 0: result[i] is rounded to that many decimal places
  - For decimals < 0: result[i] is rounded to nearest multiple of 10^(-decimals)
  - Uses banker's rounding (round half to even) for ties
  - Monotonicity: if a[i] ≤ a[j] then result[i] ≤ result[j]
  - For decimals=0: result[i] is an integer value
  - Approximation property: result[i] is close to a[i] within rounding precision
