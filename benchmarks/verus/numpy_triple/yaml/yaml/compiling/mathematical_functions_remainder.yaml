Good, the basic structure works. Now I'll provide the YAML output with simpler specifications that avoid the floating-point operations that aren't supported in Verus:

vc-description: |-
  /*
  numpy.remainder: Returns the element-wise remainder of division.
  
  Computes the remainder complementary to the floor_divide function.
  This is equivalent to x1 % x2 in terms of array broadcasting.
  
  The result has the same sign as the divisor x2.
  For floating point inputs, the result is mathematically defined as:
  x1 - floor(x1/x2) * x2
  
  From NumPy documentation:
  - Parameters: x1, x2 (array_like) - The dividend and divisor arrays
  - Returns: remainder (ndarray) - The element-wise remainder of x1 divided by x2
  - This is a universal function (ufunc) implemented in C
  - Uses optimized C loops for different data types
  
  Specification: numpy.remainder returns a vector where each element is the remainder
  of the corresponding elements from x1 and x2.
  
  Mathematical Properties:
  1. Element-wise correctness: result[i] = x1[i] % x2[i]
  2. Complementary to floor division: x1[i] = floor(x1[i]/x2[i]) * x2[i] + result[i]
  3. Sign follows divisor: result[i] has the same sign as x2[i] (when x2[i] ≠ 0)
  4. Magnitude bound: |result[i]| < |x2[i]| (when x2[i] ≠ 0)
  5. Mathematical definition: result[i] = x1[i] - floor(x1[i]/x2[i]) * x2[i]
  6. Preserves vector length: result.size = x1.size = x2.size
  7. Handles IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic
  
  Precondition: All elements in x2 must be non-zero
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] satisfies the remainder properties
