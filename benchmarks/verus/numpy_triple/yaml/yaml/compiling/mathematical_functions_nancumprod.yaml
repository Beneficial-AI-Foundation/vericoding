  /*
  Return the cumulative product of array elements over a given axis treating Not a Numbers (NaNs) as one.
  
  Return the cumulative product of array elements treating NaNs as 1.
  The cumulative product does not change when NaNs are encountered and leading NaNs are replaced by ones.
  
  Specification: nancumprod returns the cumulative product while treating NaN values as 1.
  This means:
  1. The resulting array has the same size as the input
  2. Each element is the product of all non-NaN elements from the start up to that position
  3. NaN values are treated as 1 in the product calculation
  4. Leading NaNs are replaced by ones
  5. The cumulative product property holds for non-NaN values
