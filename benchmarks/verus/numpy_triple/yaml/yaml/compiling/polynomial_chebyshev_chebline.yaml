vc-description: |-
  Chebyshev series whose graph is a straight line.
  Returns coefficients for the Chebyshev series representing off + scl*x.
  For simplicity, we always return a 2-element vector where the second element
  might be zero when scl = 0.
  
  Specification: chebline returns correct Chebyshev coefficients for a linear function.
  The key mathematical property is that the Chebyshev series T₀(x) = 1 and T₁(x) = x,
  so the coefficients [off, scl] directly represent off*T₀(x) + scl*T₁(x) = off + scl*x.
  
  The result is always a 2-element vector [off, scl], even when scl = 0.
  This represents the Chebyshev series: off * T₀(x) + scl * T₁(x) = off + scl*x
  
  Mathematical Properties:
  1. The first coefficient equals the offset parameter
  2. The second coefficient equals the scale parameter
  3. When evaluated as a Chebyshev series, this produces the line off + scl*x
  4. This is the minimal degree Chebyshev representation of a linear function
