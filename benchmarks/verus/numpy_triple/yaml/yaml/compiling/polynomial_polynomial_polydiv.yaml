vc-description: |-
  numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polydiv: Divide one polynomial by another.
      
  Returns the quotient-with-remainder of two polynomials c1 / c2.
  The arguments are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order term
  to highest, e.g., [1,2,3] represents 1 + 2*x + 3*x**2.
      
  The function performs polynomial long division, returning both
  the quotient and remainder such that c1 = c2 * quotient + remainder.
  
  Specification: polydiv performs polynomial division with remainder.
      
  Precondition: The leading coefficient of c2 (highest degree term) is non-zero
  Postcondition: 
  - The division identity holds: c1 = c2 * quotient + remainder (as polynomials)
  - The remainder has degree less than the divisor (leading coefficients are zero)
  - When the divisor is a constant polynomial, the quotient is c1 scaled by 1/c2[0]
