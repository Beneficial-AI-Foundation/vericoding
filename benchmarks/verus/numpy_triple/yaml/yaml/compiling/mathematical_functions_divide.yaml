  numpy.divide: Divide arguments element-wise.

  Divides two vectors element-wise. If the vectors have the same shape,
  each element of the result is the quotient of the corresponding elements
  from the input vectors.

  This is equivalent to x1 / x2 in terms of array broadcasting.
  Division by zero results in infinity or NaN according to IEEE 754 standard.

  Specification: numpy.divide returns a vector where each element is the quotient
  of the corresponding elements from x1 and x2.

  Precondition: True (handles division by zero according to IEEE 754)
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = x1[i] / x2[i]
  
  Additional properties:
  - When x2[i] ≠ 0, result[i] * x2[i] = x1[i] (within floating point precision)
  - When x2[i] = 0 and x1[i] ≠ 0, result[i] is infinite
  - When x2[i] = 0 and x1[i] = 0, result[i] is NaN
