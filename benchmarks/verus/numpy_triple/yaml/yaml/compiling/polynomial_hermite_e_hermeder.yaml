vc-description: |-
  Differentiate a Hermite_e series by taking the derivative of coefficients.
  Takes coefficients from low to high degree and returns differentiated coefficients.
  
  Specification: hermeder correctly differentiates Hermite_e series coefficients.
  The result has degree reduced by 1, and each coefficient is multiplied by its index
  and scaled by scl^m. For a single differentiation (m=1), the coefficient of degree k
  becomes k * scl * original_coefficient.
