  /*
  numpy.prod: Return the product of array elements over a given axis.
      
  Computes the product of all elements in the vector. For empty vectors,
  returns 1 as the identity element of multiplication.
  
  This is a reduction operation that applies multiplication across all
  elements to produce a single scalar result.
  
  Mathematical Properties:
  - Commutative: order of elements doesn't affect the final product
  - Associative: grouping of operations doesn't affect the result
  - Identity element: empty array product is 1
  - Contains zero: if any element is zero, the product is zero
  
  Specification: prod computes the product of all elements in a vector.
      
  The product operation has several important mathematical properties:
  1. For empty vectors, returns 1 (multiplicative identity)
  2. For non-empty vectors, returns the product of all elements
  3. If any element is zero, the result is zero
  4. The operation is commutative and associative
  
  This specification captures both the basic behavior and key mathematical
  properties that make prod well-defined and predictable.
