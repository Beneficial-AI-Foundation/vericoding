vc-description: |-
  The inverse of fftshift - undoes the frequency domain shifting.
      
  This function performs the inverse operation of fftshift, moving the 
  zero-frequency component from the center back to the beginning of the array.
  For even-length arrays, it is identical to fftshift.
  For odd-length arrays, it differs by one sample position.
  
  The function performs a circular shift by -(n/2) positions.
