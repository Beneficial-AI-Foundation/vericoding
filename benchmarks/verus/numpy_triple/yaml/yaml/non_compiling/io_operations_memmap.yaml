  /*
  numpy.memmap: Create a memory-map to an array stored in a binary file on disk.
  
  Memory-mapped files are used for accessing small segments of large files
  on disk, without reading the entire file into memory. The memmap provides
  an array-like interface to the file contents.
  
  This function creates a Vector view into a binary file on disk with the
  specified shape and access mode. The file is accessed starting at the
  given offset.
