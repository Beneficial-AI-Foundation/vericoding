  NPY_PI_4: Mathematical constant representing π/4.
  
  This constant provides the value of pi divided by 4, which is commonly used in
  trigonometric calculations, particularly for 45-degree angle computations.
  
  Value: π/4 ≈ 0.785398163397448309615660845819875721
  
  Specification: NPY_PI_4 returns the mathematical constant π/4.
  
  Precondition: True (no preconditions for accessing a constant)
  Postcondition: The result equals π/4, which is approximately 0.7853981633974483
  
  Mathematical properties:
  - NPY_PI_4 = π/4
  - NPY_PI_4 = arctan(1)  
  - sin(NPY_PI_4) = cos(NPY_PI_4) = √2/2
  - tan(NPY_PI_4) = 1
  - 4 * NPY_PI_4 = π
