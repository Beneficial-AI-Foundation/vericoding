vc-description: |-
  /*
  Hermite series whose graph is a straight line.
      
  Creates a Hermite series representation for the line off + scl*x.
  Returns a 2-element vector where:
  - First element is the constant term (off)
  - Second element is the linear coefficient (scl/2)
  
  Note: When scl = 0, the second element is 0, representing a constant function.
  
  Specification: hermline returns Hermite coefficients for a linear function.
  
  The Hermite series representation of off + scl*x has coefficients:
  - c₀ = off (constant term)
  - c₁ = scl/2 (linear term coefficient)
  
  These coefficients, when evaluated as a Hermite series, produce the 
  original linear function. The relationship comes from the fact that
  H₁(x) = 2x in the physicist's Hermite polynomials.
