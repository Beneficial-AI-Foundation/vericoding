  numpy.polynomial.hermite_e.hermegauss: Gauss-HermiteE quadrature.

  Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-HermiteE quadrature.
  These sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of
  degree 2*deg - 1 or less over the interval [-∞, ∞] with the weight
  function f(x) = exp(-x²/2).

  The function returns a pair (x, w) where x contains the sample points
  and w contains the corresponding weights.

  Specification: hermegauss returns quadrature points and weights for HermiteE polynomials.

  Precondition: deg > 0 (need at least one quadrature point)
  Postcondition: The returned points and weights satisfy the mathematical properties
  of Gauss-HermiteE quadrature including positivity, symmetry, and ordering.
