vc-description: |-
  Returns a vector representing a linear polynomial off + scl*x.
      
  For the linear polynomial off + scl*x, this returns:
  - [off, scl] when scl ≠ 0 (degree 1 polynomial)
  - [off] when scl = 0 (degree 0 polynomial, constant)
  
  This follows NumPy's convention where coefficients are ordered from
  lowest to highest degree, so [off, scl] represents off + scl*x.
  
  We use Vector Float 2 to represent the general case, with the understanding
  that when scl = 0, the second coefficient is meaningless.

  Specification: polyline creates correct linear polynomial representation.
  
  The function returns coefficients for the linear polynomial off + scl*x:
  - Always returns [off, scl] as a 2-element vector
  - When scl = 0, this represents the constant polynomial off
  - When scl ≠ 0, this represents the linear polynomial off + scl*x
  
  Key properties:
  1. Coefficient structure: coefficients are ordered from lowest to highest degree
  2. Constant term is always off (at index 0)
  3. Linear term coefficient is scl (at index 1)
  4. Evaluation property: at x=0, polynomial evaluates to off
  5. Slope property: derivative of polynomial is scl
  6. Mathematical correctness: represents polynomial off + scl*x
