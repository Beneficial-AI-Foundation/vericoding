  numpy.greater_equal: Return the truth value of (x1 >= x2) element-wise.
  
  Returns a boolean vector where each element indicates whether the
  corresponding element in x1 is greater than or equal to the corresponding 
  element in x2.
  
  This is equivalent to x1 >= x2 in terms of array broadcasting.
  
  Specification: numpy.greater_equal returns a boolean vector where each element
  is true if and only if the corresponding element in x1 is greater than or equal
  to the corresponding element in x2.
  
  Precondition: True (no special preconditions for comparison)
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = true â†” x1[i] >= x2[i]
  
  Additional properties:
  - The result is the element-wise negation of less(x1, x2)
  - Reflexivity: greater_equal(x, x) returns all true
  - Antisymmetry: If greater_equal(x1, x2)[i] = true and greater_equal(x2, x1)[i] = true,
                  then x1[i] = x2[i]
  - Transitivity: If greater_equal(x1, x2)[i] = true and greater_equal(x2, x3)[i] = true,
                  then greater_equal(x1, x3)[i] = true
  - For NaN values: comparison with NaN always returns false
  
  /* Reflexivity: comparing vector with itself yields all true */
  
  /* Antisymmetry with equality */
  
  /* Boolean result: each element is either true or false */
