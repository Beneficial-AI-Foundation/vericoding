  numpy.as_strided: Create a view into the array with the given shape and strides.
  
  Creates a new view of an array with specified shape and strides.
  This is a simplified version that focuses on the core mathematical
  property: creating a view with a different shape but accessing
  elements from the original array based on stride patterns.
  
  For safety, we restrict to cases where the new shape is smaller
  than or equal to the original array size.
  
  Specification: numpy.as_strided creates a view with specified strides.
  
  Precondition: The strided access must be valid (m * stride â‰¤ n)
  Postcondition: Each element in the result is taken from the original
  array at positions determined by the stride pattern.
  
  For element i in the result, it equals x[i * stride].
