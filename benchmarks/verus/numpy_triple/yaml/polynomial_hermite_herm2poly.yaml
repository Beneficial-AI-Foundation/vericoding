vc-description: |-
  Convert a Hermite series to a polynomial.
  Converts coefficients of a Hermite series (ordered from lowest to highest degree)
  to coefficients of the equivalent standard polynomial (ordered from lowest to highest degree).

  The Hermite polynomials H_n(x) satisfy the recurrence relation:
  H_{n+1}(x) = 2x * H_n(x) - 2n * H_{n-1}(x)
  with H_0(x) = 1 and H_1(x) = 2x

  This function performs the inverse transformation, converting from Hermite basis to standard basis.
