vc-description: |-
  Shift the zero-frequency component to the center of the spectrum.
  
  This function rearranges the FFT output such that the zero-frequency 
  component is moved from the beginning to the center of the array.
  For even-length arrays, it performs a circular shift by n/2.
  For odd-length arrays, it performs a circular shift by (n-1)/2.
  
  Specification: fftshift performs a circular shift that moves the zero-frequency 
  component to the center of the array.
  
  The function rearranges elements by performing a circular shift:
  - Each element at position i in the result comes from position (i + n - n/2) % n in the input
  - This is equivalent to swapping the first and second halves of the array
  - The zero-frequency component (originally at index 0) moves to the center
  
  Key mathematical properties:
  1. Bijective mapping: every element is preserved and appears exactly once
  2. Circular shift property: implements a specific permutation
  3. Involution property: for even n, fftshift(fftshift(x)) = x
  4. Sum preservation: the sum of all elements remains unchanged
