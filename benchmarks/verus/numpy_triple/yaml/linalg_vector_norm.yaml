  numpy.linalg.vector_norm: Compute the p-norm of a vector for a given order p.
  
  This function computes vector norms of different orders (p-norms).
  For a vector x and order p, the p-norm is defined as:
  ||x||_p = (sum(|x[i]|^p))^(1/p) for p ≥ 1
  
  Special cases:
  - p = 1: Manhattan norm (sum of absolute values)
  - p = 2: Euclidean norm (square root of sum of squares)
  - p = ∞: Maximum norm (largest absolute value)
  - p = -∞: Minimum norm (smallest absolute value)
  - p = 0: Zero norm (count of non-zero elements)
  
  This implementation focuses on the most common p-norm cases for 1D vectors.
  
  Specification: vector_norm computes the p-norm of a vector for various values of p.
  
  The p-norm is a generalization of the common vector norms used in numerical computing.
  This specification covers the mathematical definition and key properties of p-norms.
  
  Mathematical definition:
  - For p ≥ 1: ||x||_p = (Σᵢ |xᵢ|^p)^(1/p)
  - For p = 1: ||x||_1 = Σᵢ |xᵢ| (Manhattan norm)
  - For p = 2: ||x||_2 = √(Σᵢ xᵢ²) (Euclidean norm)
  - For p = 0: ||x||_0 = count of non-zero elements
  
  Key properties verified:
  1. Definition: For p ≥ 1, result equals (sum of |xi|^p)^(1/p)
  2. Non-negativity: norm(x, p) ≥ 0 for all x and valid p
  3. Definiteness: norm(x, p) = 0 iff x is zero vector (for p > 0)
  4. Special cases: p=1 (Manhattan), p=2 (Euclidean), p=0 (zero norm)
  5. Empty vector: norm of empty vector is 0
  
  Preconditions:
  - p must be a non-negative real number
  - For p = 0, it counts non-zero elements (special case)
  - For p ≥ 1, it computes the standard p-norm
