vc-description: |-
  Replace NaN with zero and infinity with large finite numbers element-wise
  
  Specification: nan_to_num replaces non-finite floating-point values with finite alternatives:
  1. NaN replacement: All NaN values are replaced with 0.0
  2. Positive infinity replacement: All positive infinity values are replaced with a large finite value  
  3. Negative infinity replacement: All negative infinity values are replaced with a large negative finite value
  4. Finite value preservation: All finite values remain unchanged
  5. All results are finite: The output contains only finite floating-point numbers
