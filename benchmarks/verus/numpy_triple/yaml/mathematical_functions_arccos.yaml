vc-description: |-
  Trigonometric inverse cosine, element-wise.
  Returns the arc cosine of each element in the input vector.
  The result is in the range [0, π].

  Specification: arccos returns the inverse cosine of each element.
  Precondition: All elements must be in the range [-1, 1] for valid results.
  Postcondition: The result contains the arc cosine of each input element,
  with values in the range [0, π], and satisfies cos(arccos(x)) = x for valid inputs.
  Additionally, arccos is monotonically decreasing on its domain [-1, 1].
