  For each element in a, return a list of the lines in the element, breaking at line boundaries
  
  For each element in a vector of strings, return a list of the lines in the element, breaking at line boundaries 
  
  Specification: splitlines returns a vector where each string is split into a list of lines
  based on line boundaries, with proper handling of keepends and line break characters
