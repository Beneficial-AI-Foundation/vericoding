vc-description: |-
  numpy.ndim: Return the number of dimensions of an array.
  
  In our Vector-based framework, vectors are always 1-dimensional.
  This function returns 1 for any vector input, representing the fact
  that Vector T n is a 1D array with n elements.
  
  Note: In NumPy, scalars are 0-dimensional, but in our framework,
  we represent them as Vector T 1, so this always returns 1.
