  numpy.corrcoef: Return Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients.
  
  The correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two variables.
  For two vectors x and y, the correlation coefficient is computed as:
  
  corr(x, y) = cov(x, y) / (std(x) * std(y))
  
  Where:
  - cov(x, y) is the covariance between x and y
  - std(x) and std(y) are the standard deviations of x and y
  
  This function computes the correlation coefficient between two vectors of observations.
  The result is bounded between -1 and 1, where:
  - 1 indicates perfect positive correlation
  - -1 indicates perfect negative correlation  
  - 0 indicates no linear correlation
  
  Requires non-empty vectors and non-zero variance in both variables.
  
  Specification: corrcoef computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between two vectors.
  
  The correlation coefficient satisfies several mathematical properties:
  1. Symmetry: corr(x, y) = corr(y, x)
  2. Bounded: -1 ≤ corr(x, y) ≤ 1
  3. Self-correlation: corr(x, x) = 1 (if x has non-zero variance)
  4. Scale invariance: correlation is preserved under linear transformations
  
  Precondition: Both vectors have non-zero variance (not all elements equal)
  Postcondition: Result is bounded between -1 and 1, and captures linear relationship
