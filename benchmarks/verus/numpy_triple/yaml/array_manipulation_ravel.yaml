  /*
  numpy.ravel: Return a contiguous flattened array.
  
  For 1D arrays, ravel returns the input array unchanged since it's already
  flat. This reflects numpy's behavior where raveling a 1D array has no effect.
  
  For multi-dimensional arrays (not covered here), ravel would flatten them
  into a 1D array following the specified order ('C' for row-major, 'F' for
  column-major, etc.).
  
  Specification: numpy.ravel returns the input vector unchanged for 1D arrays.
  
  Precondition: True (no special preconditions for 1D ravel)
  Postcondition: The result is identical to the input vector, maintaining
                 all elements in their original order
