  numpy.ceil: Return the ceiling of the input, element-wise.
  
  The ceiling of each element x is the smallest integer i, such that i >= x.
  This is a fundamental mathematical operation that rounds up to the
  nearest integer.
  
  Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the ceiling of each element.
  
  Specification: numpy.ceil returns a vector where each element is the
  ceiling (smallest integer greater than or equal to) the corresponding element in x.
  
  Precondition: True (ceiling is defined for all real numbers)
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] is the ceiling of x[i], meaning:
  - result[i] is an integer value (represented as Float)
  - result[i] ≥ x[i]
  - result[i] < x[i] + 1
  - There is no integer k such that x[i] ≤ k < result[i]
  - Monotonicity: if x[i] ≤ x[j] then result[i] ≤ result[j]
  - Relationship with floor: result[i] = -((-x[i]).floor)
