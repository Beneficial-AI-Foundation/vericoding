  numpy.column_stack: Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.
  
  Takes a sequence of 1-D arrays and stacks them as columns to make a 
  single 2-D array. All input arrays must have the same length (number 
  of rows in the output).
  
  The result is represented as a flattened vector in column-major order,
  where elements from the same column are contiguous. For a result with
  'rows' rows and 'cols' columns, element at position (i, j) is stored
  at index j * rows + i in the flattened vector.
  
  This is a fundamental array manipulation operation that combines multiple
  1D arrays into a single 2D structure, useful for constructing matrices
  from column vectors.
  
  Specification: column_stack creates a 2D array (as flattened vector) where
  each input array becomes a column.
  
  Precondition: cols > 0 (at least one input array)
  Postcondition: 
  - The result contains all elements from the input arrays
  - Elements are arranged in column-major order
  - The j-th column of the result contains all elements from arrays[j]
  - For 0 ≤ i < rows and 0 ≤ j < cols, the element at position (i,j)
    in the 2D view equals arrays[j][i] and is stored at index j*rows + i
