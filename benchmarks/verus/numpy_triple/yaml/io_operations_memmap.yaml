  numpy.memmap: Create a memory-map to an array stored in a binary file on disk.

  Memory-mapped files are used for accessing small segments of large files
  on disk, without reading the entire file into memory. The memmap provides
  an array-like interface to the file contents.

  This function creates a Vector view into a binary file on disk with the
  specified shape and access mode. The file is accessed starting at the
  given offset.

  Specification: numpy.memmap creates a memory-mapped view of a file.

  This specification captures the essential properties of memory mapping:
  1. The result is a valid vector of the specified size
  2. The mapping respects the file access mode constraints
  3. The offset is within valid bounds for the file
  4. Read-only modes preserve data integrity
  5. Write modes allow modification of the underlying file

  Preconditions:
  - The filename represents a valid file path
  - The offset is non-negative and within the file bounds
  - For WriteNew mode, the file will be created if it doesn't exist
  - For ReadOnly mode, the file must exist and be readable

  Postconditions:
  - Returns a vector of the specified size n
  - The vector provides a view into the file starting at the given offset
  - Read operations reflect the file contents at the mapped region
  - Write operations (when mode allows) modify the underlying file
  - The mapping preserves the mathematical properties of array access
