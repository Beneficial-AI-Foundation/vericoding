  numpy.gradient: Return the gradient of an N-dimensional array.
  
  The gradient is computed using second order accurate central differences 
  in the interior points and either first or second order accurate one-sided 
  (forward or backwards) differences at the boundaries.
  
  For a 1D array, the gradient is a vector of the same size where:
  - At the boundaries, one-sided differences are used
  - In the interior, central differences are used
  
  This captures the rate of change of the function represented by the array.
  
  Specification: numpy.gradient computes the numerical gradient using finite differences.
  
  The gradient satisfies these mathematical properties:
  1. For a single point array (n = 0), the gradient is 0
  2. For arrays with multiple points (n > 0):
     - At the first boundary (i = 0): uses forward difference grad[0] = f[1] - f[0]
     - At the last boundary (i = n): uses backward difference grad[n] = f[n] - f[n-1]
     - For interior points (0 < i < n): uses central difference grad[i] = (f[i+1] - f[i-1]) / 2
  3. The gradient has the same size as the input array
  4. The gradient approximates the derivative at each point
  
  This specification assumes unit spacing between points. The actual numpy 
  function can handle custom spacing, but we focus on the core mathematical behavior.
  
  Mathematical properties:
  - For linear functions f(x) = ax + b, the gradient is constant and equal to a
  - For constant functions, the gradient is 0 everywhere
  - The gradient operation is linear: grad(f + g) = grad(f) + grad(g)
  
  Precondition: True (non-empty constraint is in the type Vector Float (n + 1))
  Postcondition: The gradient is computed using appropriate finite difference formulas
