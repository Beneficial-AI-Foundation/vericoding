  numpy.empty: Return a new array of given shape and type, without initializing entries.
  
  Creates a new vector of the specified length containing uninitialized (arbitrary) values.
  This is a low-level function that allocates memory without setting initial values,
  making it potentially faster than other array creation functions.
  
  For 1D arrays, this takes a size parameter n and returns a Vector Float n
  with arbitrary values.
  
  Specification: numpy.empty returns a vector of the specified size with arbitrary values.
  
  Properties:
  1. The returned vector has exactly n elements (guaranteed by type)
  2. Each element in the vector is a valid Float value
  3. The vector is well-formed - all indices are accessible
  4. No guarantees are made about the actual values - they are arbitrary/uninitialized
  
  Mathematical properties:
  - Size property: The length of the result is exactly n
  - Accessibility property: All elements from index 0 to n-1 are accessible via get
  - Value existence: Each position contains some Float value (but we don't specify which)
  
  This specification captures the key behavior of numpy.empty: it returns a properly
  sized array but makes no promises about the contents, which distinguishes it from
  functions like zeros() or ones() that guarantee specific initial values.
