  numpy.exp: Calculate the exponential of all elements in the input array.
  
  Computes the exponential function (e^x) element-wise. This is the inverse
  of the natural logarithm function. For each element x in the input array,
  the result contains e^x where e is Euler's number (approximately 2.71828).
  
  The exponential function has the mathematical property that exp(x + y) = exp(x) * exp(y)
  and exp(0) = 1.
  
  Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the exponential values.
  
  Specification: numpy.exp returns a vector where each element is the
  exponential (e^x) of the corresponding element in x.
  
  Precondition: True (exponential function is defined for all real numbers)
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = e^(x[i])
  
  Mathematical properties:
  - exp(0) = 1 for any zero elements
  - exp(x) > 0 for all x (exponential is always positive)
  - exp is monotonically increasing
  - exp(x + y) = exp(x) * exp(y) (for addition in the input)
  
  /* Mathematical specification: For all indices i, result[i] = exp(x[i])
             Note: Verus doesn't have built-in exp function for f32,
             so we provide a simplified specification that maintains array length */
