  IEEE 754 floating point representation of (positive) infinity
  
  Specification: inf represents positive infinity with the following properties:
  1. inf is greater than any finite float value
  2. inf + any finite value = inf
  3. inf * positive finite value = inf
  4. inf * negative finite value = -inf
  5. inf / any finite non-zero value = inf (with appropriate sign)
