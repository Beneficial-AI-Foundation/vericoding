vc-description: |-
  numpy.positive: Numerical positive, element-wise.
  
  Returns a copy of the input array with the same values.
  This is equivalent to the unary plus operator (+x) and 
  is only defined for types that support arithmetic operations.
  
  The function performs element-wise positive operation, which
  for real numbers simply returns the same value.
  
  Specification: numpy.positive returns a vector where each element is
  the positive of the corresponding element in x (which is the same value).
  
  Precondition: True (no special preconditions for positive operation)
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = +x[i] = x[i]
  
  Mathematical Properties:
  - Identity operation: positive(x) = x
  - Idempotence: positive(positive(x)) = positive(x)
  - Preserves sign: sign(positive(x)) = sign(x)
  - Preserves magnitude: |positive(x)| = |x|
  - Distributivity with multiplication: positive(x) * y = x * y
