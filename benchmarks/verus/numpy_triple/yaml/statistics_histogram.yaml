  numpy.histogram: Compute the histogram of a dataset.
  
  Computes the histogram of a dataset by dividing the range into equal-width bins
  and counting the number of values that fall into each bin.
  
  The function returns both the histogram counts and the bin edges.
  For n_bins bins, there are n_bins+1 bin edges.
  
  This implementation focuses on the core mathematical properties:
  - Monotonically increasing bin edges
  - Equal bin widths (uniform binning)
  - Correct counting of values in each bin
  - Conservation of total count
  
  Specification: histogram correctly partitions data into bins and counts occurrences.
  
  The histogram satisfies fundamental mathematical properties:
  1. Bin edges are monotonically increasing
  2. The first edge equals min_val and the last edge equals max_val
  3. Bin widths are equal for uniform binning
  4. Each bin count equals the number of data points in that bin
  5. The sum of all bin counts equals the number of data points in range
  
  Precondition: Number of bins > 0 and min_val < max_val
  Postcondition: The result satisfies the histogram mathematical properties
  
  // Boundary conditions: first edge is min_val, last edge is max_val
  
  // Result histogram has correct length
  
  // Conservation: total count equals number of data points in range
