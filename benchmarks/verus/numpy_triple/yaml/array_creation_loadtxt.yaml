vc-description: |-
  Load data from a text file containing numeric values.
  This simplified version assumes:
  - The file contains floating-point numbers (one per line or whitespace-separated)
  - Comments starting with '#' are ignored
  - The skiprows parameter allows skipping initial lines
  Returns a vector of parsed float values.

  Specification: loadtxt reads numeric data from a text file and returns a vector of floats.
  The preconditions ensure:
  - The file path is valid (non-empty string)
  - After skipping skiprows lines and removing comments, there are exactly n valid float values

  The postcondition guarantees:
  - The result vector contains the float values parsed from the file
  - Values appear in the same order as in the file (after skipping and comment removal)
  - The size of the result matches the type-level size n

  Mathematical properties:
  - Deterministic: same file and parameters always produce the same result
  - Order-preserving: maintains the sequential order of values in the file
  - Comment-aware: lines starting with '#' are ignored
  - Skip-aware: first skiprows lines are ignored
