  numpy.insert: Insert values along the given axis before the given indices.
  
  Creates a new vector with values inserted at specified positions. For the 1D case,
  values are inserted before the given index position, shifting subsequent elements.
  
  When inserting a single value at position i into a vector of length n,
  the result has length n+1 where:
  - Elements before position i remain unchanged
  - The new value is at position i
  - Elements from position i onward are shifted by one
  
  This specification focuses on single value insertion. The actual NumPy function
  supports multiple insertions and various index specifications, but for formal
  verification we start with the simplest case.
  
  Specification: numpy.insert creates a new vector with the value inserted at the specified index.
  
  Precondition: The index is valid (enforced by type system via Fin (n + 1))
  
  Postcondition: 
  1. **Preservation**: Elements before the insertion point are preserved at their original indices
  2. **Insertion**: The new value is placed exactly at the specified index
  3. **Shifting**: Elements at or after the insertion point are shifted right by one position
  4. **Size**: The result has exactly one more element than the input
  
  Mathematical properties:
  - For all i < idx: result[i] = arr[i]
  - result[idx] = value
  - For all i > idx: result[i] = arr[i-1]
  
  Additional properties (sanity checks):
  - The operation is deterministic (same inputs produce same output)
  - The operation preserves the relative order of existing elements
  - No elements from the original array are lost or duplicated
  
  /* Elements before insertion point are preserved */
  
  /* The new value is at the specified index */
  
  /* Elements after insertion point are shifted */
  
  /* Sanity check: all original elements are preserved */
