vc-description: |-
  NumPy's boolean scalar type representing True.
  This is NumPy's equivalent of Python's built-in True, but as a NumPy scalar type.
  Comparison operations in NumPy return this type instead of Python's bool.
  
  Specification: numpy.True_ represents the boolean value true and has the following properties:
  1. It equals the Lean boolean true
  2. It is the identity element for logical AND operations
  3. It is the absorbing element for logical OR operations
  4. Its negation gives false
