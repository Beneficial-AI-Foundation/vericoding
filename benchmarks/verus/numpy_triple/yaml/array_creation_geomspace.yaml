vc-description: |-
  Return numbers spaced evenly on a log scale (a geometric progression).
  Each output sample is a constant multiple of the previous one.
  
  Specification: geomspace returns a geometric progression from start to stop.
  - The first element is always start
  - If endpoint is true and n > 1, the last element is stop
  - All elements form a geometric progression (constant ratio between consecutive elements)
  - Neither start nor stop can be zero
