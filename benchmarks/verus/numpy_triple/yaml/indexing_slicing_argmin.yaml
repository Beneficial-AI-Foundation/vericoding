vc-description: |-
  numpy.argmin: Returns the index of the minimum value in a vector.
  
  Returns the index of the minimum value among all elements in the array.
  Requires a non-empty array since there is no minimum of an empty set.

  This function returns the position of the smallest element in the array.
  In case of multiple occurrences of the minimum value, the index of the
  first occurrence is returned.

  Specification: argmin returns the index of the minimum element.

  Precondition: True (non-empty constraint is in the type)
  Postcondition: The element at the returned index is the minimum value,
  and it is the first occurrence of this minimum value in the array.
