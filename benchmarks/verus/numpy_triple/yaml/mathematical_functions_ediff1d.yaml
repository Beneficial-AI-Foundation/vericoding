  numpy.ediff1d: The differences between consecutive elements of an array.

  Computes the differences between consecutive elements of an array.
  For an input array [a, b, c, d], returns [b-a, c-b, d-c].

  The function always returns a 1D array, and if necessary, the input
  will be flattened before the differences are taken.

  This is equivalent to ary.flat[1:] - ary.flat[:-1] in NumPy.

  Specification: numpy.ediff1d returns a vector of differences between consecutive elements.

  Precondition: The input vector must have at least one element (enforced by type)
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = ary[i+1] - ary[i]

  Key properties:
  1. The result has length n for input of length n+1
  2. Each element represents the difference between consecutive elements
  3. The result is always 1D regardless of input shape
  4. Mathematically: result[i] = ary[i+1] - ary[i] for all valid i
