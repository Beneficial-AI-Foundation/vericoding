  numpy.arcsin: Inverse sine, element-wise.
  
  Computes the inverse sine (arcsine) of each element in the input array.
  The result is the angle in radians whose sine is the input value.
  
  For real arguments, the domain is [-1, 1] and the range is [-π/2, π/2].
  Values outside [-1, 1] will result in NaN.
  
  Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the inverse sine values in radians.
  
  Specification: numpy.arcsin returns a vector where each element is the
  inverse sine of the corresponding element in x.
  
  Precondition: All elements of x must be in the domain [-1, 1] for real results
  Postcondition: For all indices i where x[i] is in [-1, 1]:
  - result[i] = arcsin(x[i])
  - result[i] is in the range [-π/2, π/2]
  - sin(result[i]) = x[i] (inverse relationship holds)
  - arcsin is monotonic: if x[i] ≤ x[j] then result[i] ≤ result[j]
  - Special values: arcsin(0) = 0, arcsin(1) = π/2, arcsin(-1) = -π/2
