  /*
  numpy.sin: Trigonometric sine, element-wise.
  
  Computes the sine of each element in the input vector, where each element 
  is interpreted as an angle in radians. The sine function is one of the 
  fundamental trigonometric functions.
  
  For a real number x interpreted as an angle in radians, sin(x) gives the 
  y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle at angle x from the positive x-axis.
  
  Returns a vector of the same shape as the input, containing the sine of each element.
  
  Specification: numpy.sin returns a vector where each element is the sine
  of the corresponding element in x (interpreted as radians).
  
  The specification captures key mathematical properties:
  1. Element-wise computation: result[i] = sin(x[i])
  2. Range bounds: sine values are always in [-1, 1]
  3. Fundamental trigonometric identities:
     - sin(0) = 0
     - sin(π/2) = 1
     - sin(π) = 0 (approximately, within floating-point precision)
     - sin(3π/2) = -1
     - sin(2π) = 0 (approximately, within floating-point precision)
  4. Periodicity: sin(x + 2π) = sin(x)
  5. Odd function property: sin(-x) = -sin(x)
