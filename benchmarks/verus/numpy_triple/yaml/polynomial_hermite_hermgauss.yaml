  Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-Hermite quadrature.
  
  Gauss-Hermite quadrature.

      Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-Hermite quadrature.
      These sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of
      degree 2*deg - 1 or less over the interval [-∞, ∞]
      with the weight function f(x) = exp(-x²).

      Parameters
      ----------
      deg : int
          Number of sample points and weights. It must be >= 1.

      Returns
      -------
      x : ndarray
          1-D ndarray containing the sample points.
      y : ndarray
          1-D ndarray containing the weights.

      Notes
      -----
      The results have only been tested up to degree 100, higher degrees may
      be problematic. The weights are determined by using the fact that

      w_k = c / (H'_n(x_k) * H_{n-1}(x_k))

      where c is a constant independent of k and x_k
      is the k'th root of H_n, and then scaling the results to get
      the right value when integrating 1.
