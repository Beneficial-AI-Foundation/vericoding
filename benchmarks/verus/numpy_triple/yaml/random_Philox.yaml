  Philox (4x64) pseudo-random number generator.

  Philox is a counter-based RNG that generates pseudo-random numbers
  using a counter and key. It provides high-quality random numbers
  with a large period (2^256 - 1) and supports parallel generation.

  The core operation takes a seed and generates a vector of random
  numbers in the range [0, 1).

  Specification: Philox generates pseudo-random numbers with deterministic behavior.

  The Philox algorithm has several key mathematical properties:
  1. Deterministic: same seed produces same sequence
  2. Uniform distribution: values are uniformly distributed in [0, 1)
  3. Range constraint: all values are in the half-open interval [0, 1)
  4. Reproducibility: identical seeds produce identical sequences

  Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
  Postcondition: All values are in [0, 1) and sequence is deterministic based on seed
