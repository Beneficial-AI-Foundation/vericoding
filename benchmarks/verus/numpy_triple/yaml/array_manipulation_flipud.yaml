  numpy.flipud: Reverse the order of elements along axis 0 (up/down).
  
  For a 1D array, this reverses the entire array.
  For 2D arrays, this reverses the order of rows while preserving 
  the elements within each row.
  
  Returns a view of the input array with elements reversed along axis 0.
  
  Specification: flipud reverses the order of elements in the vector.
  
  Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = m[n-1-i]
  
  This specification captures both the sanity check (result has same size)
  and the mathematical property (elements are reversed).
