vc-description: |-
  Computes the weighted average along the specified axis.
  
  Computes the weighted average of the elements in the input vector.
  If weights are not provided, it computes the arithmetic mean.
  If weights are provided, it computes the weighted average where each
  element contributes according to its associated weight.
  
  The weighted average is computed as:
  sum(a * weights) / sum(weights)
  
  When weights are not provided, this reduces to:
  sum(a) / len(a)
