vc-description: |-
  Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.
  These sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of
  degree 2*n - 1 or less over the interval [-1, 1] with the weight 
  function f(x) = 1/√(1 - x²).

  Specification: chebgauss returns Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature nodes and weights
  where nodes are the zeros of the n-th Chebyshev polynomial and weights are 
  uniform π/n. The nodes are given by cos(π(2i-1)/(2n)) for i = 1 to n.
