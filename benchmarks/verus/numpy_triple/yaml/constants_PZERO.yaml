  IEEE 754 floating point representation of positive zero
  
  Specification: PZERO represents IEEE 754 positive zero with the following properties:
  1. It equals the standard zero value
  2. It behaves as the additive identity
  3. It behaves as expected in multiplication and division
  4. It has special IEEE 754 properties (e.g., 1.0 / PZERO = +∞)
