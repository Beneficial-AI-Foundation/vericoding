  numpy.atleast_1d: Convert inputs to arrays with at least one dimension.
  
  This function ensures that the input has at least one dimension.
  - Scalar inputs are converted to 1-dimensional arrays with a single element
  - Higher-dimensional inputs (vectors) are preserved unchanged
  
  For the Vector-based implementation, we provide a version that takes
  a vector and returns it unchanged, since Vectors already have at least
  one dimension by construction.
  
  Specification: atleast_1d returns the input vector unchanged.
  
  Since Vectors in Lean already have at least one dimension by their type,
  this function acts as an identity function for vectors.
  
  Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
  Postcondition: The result is identical to the input vector
