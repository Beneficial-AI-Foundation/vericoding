vc-description: |-
  Subtract one Chebyshev series from another component-wise.
  The input vectors c1 and c2 represent Chebyshev series coefficients
  ordered from lowest to highest degree term.

  Specification: chebsub performs component-wise subtraction of two Chebyshev series.

  The specification includes:
  1. The basic property that each coefficient in the result is the difference
     of the corresponding coefficients in c1 and c2
  2. Anti-commutativity: chebsub(c1, c2) = -chebsub(c2, c1)
  3. Identity property: subtracting a series from itself yields zero
  4. Associativity with addition: (c1 - c2) + c2 = c1
