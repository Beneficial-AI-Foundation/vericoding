  numpy.fft.hfft: Compute the FFT of a signal that has Hermitian symmetry.
  
  The Hermitian FFT assumes that the input signal has Hermitian symmetry,
  which means that the signal in the frequency domain is real-valued.
  This is the inverse operation of rfft.
  
  For a signal with Hermitian symmetry, the output will be real-valued
  and the length of the transform is determined by the input length.
  If input has length m, the output has length 2*(m-1).
  
  The function essentially computes the inverse of rfft by taking
  the conjugate of the input and then computing the inverse real FFT.
  
  Specification: numpy.fft.hfft computes the FFT of a signal with Hermitian symmetry.
  
  Precondition: The input vector represents a Hermitian symmetric signal
  Postcondition: The output is a real-valued vector of length 2*m where
  the input had length m+1, and the transformation preserves certain mathematical 
  properties of the Hermitian FFT including:
  1. The output is real-valued (no imaginary parts)
  2. The length relationship: if input has m+1 elements, output has 2*m elements
  3. Hermitian symmetry properties are preserved in the transform
  4. The conjugate relationship: this is effectively the inverse of an rfft operation
