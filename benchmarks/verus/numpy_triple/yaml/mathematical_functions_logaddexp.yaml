  numpy.logaddexp: Logarithm of the sum of exponentiations of the inputs.
  
  Calculates log(exp(x1) + exp(x2)) element-wise. This function is useful 
  in statistics where the calculated probabilities of events may be so small 
  as to exceed the range of normal floating point numbers.
  
  The logaddexp function provides a numerically stable way to compute
  log(exp(x1) + exp(x2)) without intermediate overflow or underflow.
  
  Mathematical properties:
  - logaddexp(x, x) = x + log(2)
  - logaddexp(x, -∞) = x
  - logaddexp(-∞, x) = x
  - logaddexp is symmetric: logaddexp(x, y) = logaddexp(y, x)
  - logaddexp is associative in the sense that it satisfies the log-sum-exp properties
  - logaddexp(x, y) ≥ max(x, y) for all x, y
  
  From NumPy documentation:
  - Parameters: x1, x2 (array_like) - Input arrays
  - Returns: ndarray - The element-wise logaddexp of the inputs
  
  Specification: numpy.logaddexp returns a vector where each element is the
  logarithm of the sum of exponentiations of the corresponding elements.
  
  Mathematical Properties:
  1. Element-wise correctness: result[i] = log(exp(x1[i]) + exp(x2[i]))
  2. Commutativity: logaddexp(x1, x2) = logaddexp(x2, x1)
  3. Numerical stability: avoids intermediate overflow/underflow
  4. Bounds: logaddexp(x, y) ≥ max(x, y) for all x, y
  5. Special cases: 
     - logaddexp(x, x) = x + log(2)
     - logaddexp(x, -∞) = x (when x is finite)
     - logaddexp(-∞, x) = x (when x is finite)
  6. Monotonicity: logaddexp is monotonically increasing in both arguments
  7. Associativity property: satisfies log-sum-exp algebraic relations
  
  Precondition: True (logaddexp is defined for all real numbers)
  Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = log(exp(x1[i]) + exp(x2[i]))
                 and result[i] ≥ max(x1[i], x2[i])
