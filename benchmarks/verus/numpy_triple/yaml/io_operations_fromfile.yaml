vc-description: |-
  Construct an array from data in a text or binary file
  
  This function provides a highly efficient way of reading binary data with a known data-type, 
  as well as parsing simply formatted text files. Data written using the tofile method can be 
  read using this function.
  
  Construct a vector from data in a text or binary file
  Parameters:
  - file: File handle for the input file
  - dtype: Data type of the returned array
  - count: Number of items to read (-1 means entire file)
  - sep: Separator between items (empty string means binary file)
  - offset: Byte offset from file's current position (binary files only)
  
  Specification: fromfile reads data from a file and constructs a vector
  Properties:
  1. For binary files (sep = ""), reads exactly count items if count > 0
  2. For text files (sep â‰  ""), parses items separated by sep
  3. If count = -1, reads all available data
  4. Binary files respect the offset parameter
  5. The resulting vector has the correct size and data type
  6. Data is read sequentially from the file
