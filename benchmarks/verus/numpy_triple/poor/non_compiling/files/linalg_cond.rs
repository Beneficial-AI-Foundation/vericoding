/* Compute the condition number of a matrix.

The condition number measures how sensitive the solution x is to errors in b for Ax=b.

Parameters:
- x: The matrix
- p: Order of the norm

Returns:
- c: The condition number

Compute the condition number of a square matrix using the 2-norm.

The condition number of a matrix A is defined as ||A|| * ||A^(-1)||,
where ||.|| is the matrix norm. For the 2-norm, this equals the ratio
of the largest singular value to the smallest singular value.

The condition number measures how sensitive the solution x is to errors 
in b for the linear system Ax = b. A condition number of 1 indicates
a perfectly conditioned matrix, while large condition numbers indicate
ill-conditioned matrices.

Specification: The condition number is always non-negative and is at least 1 
for any invertible matrix. This captures the fundamental mathematical 
properties of condition numbers in linear algebra. */
