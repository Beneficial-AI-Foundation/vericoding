vc-description: |-
  Trigonometric inverse tangent, element-wise.
  
  The inverse of tan, so that if y = tan(x) then x = arctan(y).
  
  Computes the element-wise inverse tangent of a vector.
  
  Specification: arctan computes the inverse tangent of each element,
  with comprehensive mathematical properties including range bounds,
  monotonicity, and behavior at special values.
