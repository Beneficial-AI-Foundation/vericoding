vc-description: |-
  numpy.sort: Return a sorted copy of an array.
  
  Returns a new array with the same elements sorted in ascending order.
  The original array is not modified. This function performs a stable sort 
  on the array elements, meaning that when multiple records have the same key,
  their original order is preserved.
  
  Parameters:
  - a : array_like - Array to be sorted
  
  Returns:
  - sorted_array : ndarray - Array of the same type and shape as a, with elements sorted
  
  Specification: numpy.sort returns a sorted permutation of the input array.
  
  The specification captures three key properties:
  1. Sorting property: Elements are in non-decreasing order
  2. Permutation property: The result contains exactly the same elements as the input
  3. Stability property: Relative order of equal elements is preserved (implicit in permutation)
  
  Precondition: True (works for any vector)
  Postcondition: Result is sorted and is a permutation of the input
