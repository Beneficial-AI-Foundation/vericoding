/* numpy.fft.fftfreq: Return the Discrete Fourier Transform sample frequencies.
    
The function returns the discrete Fourier Transform sample frequencies
with frequency bin centers in cycles per unit of sample spacing.

For even n: frequencies are [0, 1, ..., n/2-1, -n/2, ..., -1] / (d*n)
For odd n: frequencies are [0, 1, ..., (n-1)/2, -(n-1)/2, ..., -1] / (d*n)

The frequencies are arranged in standard DFT order: positive frequencies
first, then negative frequencies.

Specification: fftfreq returns sample frequencies according to the DFT convention.
    
The frequencies are arranged so that:
- The first half contains non-negative frequencies [0, 1, ..., N-1] / (d*n)
- The second half contains negative frequencies for the remaining indices

where N = (n + 1) / 2 is the number of non-negative frequencies.

Preconditions:
- n > 0 (non-empty frequency array)
- d ≠ 0 (valid sample spacing)

Postconditions:
- For indices i < N: result[i] = i / (d*n)
- For indices i ≥ N: result[i] = (i - n) / (d*n)
- The DC component (index 0) is always 0
- The frequencies are symmetric around the Nyquist frequency */
