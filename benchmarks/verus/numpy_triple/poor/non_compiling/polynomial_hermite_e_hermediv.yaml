  /*
  Divide one Hermite series by another, returning quotient and remainder.
  The dividend c1 and divisor c2 are coefficient vectors representing Hermite polynomials.
  The division is performed in the Hermite polynomial basis with reprojection.
  
  Specification: hermediv performs polynomial division of Hermite series, returning
  both quotient and remainder such that c1 = quo * c2 + rem (in Hermite basis).
  
  Key mathematical properties:
  1. Division identity: The dividend equals quotient times divisor plus remainder
  2. Remainder degree constraint: The remainder has degree less than the divisor
  3. Non-zero divisor: The divisor must not be the zero polynomial
  4. Reprojection: Results are reprojected onto the Hermite polynomial basis set
  
  The specification captures the fundamental division algorithm for polynomials
  adapted to the Hermite polynomial basis set.
