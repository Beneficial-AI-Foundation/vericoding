/* Multiply a Chebyshev series by x.
This function multiplies a Chebyshev polynomial represented by its coefficients by x.
The operation is based on the recurrence relation:
- xT₀(x) = T₁(x)
- xTₙ(x) = (Tₙ₊₁(x) + Tₙ₋₁(x))/2 for n ≥ 1

Specification: chebmulx correctly multiplies a Chebyshev polynomial by x.

Given coefficients c = [c₀, c₁, ..., cₙ₋₁] representing the polynomial
P(x) = c₀T₀(x) + c₁T₁(x) + ... + cₙ₋₁Tₙ₋₁(x),
this function computes coefficients for xP(x).

The implementation follows from the Chebyshev recurrence relations:
- xT₀(x) = T₁(x)
- xTₙ(x) = (Tₙ₊₁(x) + Tₙ₋₁(x))/2 for n ≥ 1

The algorithm redistributes coefficients according to these relations,
resulting in a polynomial with degree increased by 1. */
