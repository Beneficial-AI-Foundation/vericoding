/* Compute the 'inverse' of an N-dimensional array

The result is an inverse for a relative to the tensordot operation tensordot(a, b, ind), i.e., up to floating-point accuracy, tensordot(tensorinv(a), a, ind) is the identity tensor.

Compute the 'inverse' of an N-dimensional array.
For simplicity, we implement the case where the tensor is represented as a 2D matrix
(viewed as a flattened N-dimensional array) and we compute its matrix inverse.
The result should be the inverse for the tensordot operation.

Specification: tensorinv computes the tensor inverse such that when composed
with the original tensor via tensordot operation, it yields the identity tensor.
The key properties are:
1. The result has the same square dimensions as the input
2. The tensor inverse, when applied via tensordot, acts as a left inverse
3. The tensor must be 'square' (equal first and last dimensions products)
4. The index parameter must be positive */
