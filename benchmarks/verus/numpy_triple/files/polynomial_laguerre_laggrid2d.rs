/* numpy.polynomial.laguerre.laggrid2d: Evaluate a 2-D Laguerre series on the Cartesian product of x and y.

This function computes the values p(a,b) = ∑_{i,j} c_{i,j} * L_i(a) * L_j(b)
where the points (a,b) consist of all pairs formed by taking a from x and b from y.
The resulting points form a grid with x in the first dimension and y in the second.

The coefficients c represent a 2D matrix where c[i,j] is the coefficient for
the term of multi-degree i,j in the Laguerre series expansion.

Specification: laggrid2d evaluates a 2D Laguerre series on the Cartesian product of x and y.

The function computes p(a,b) = ∑_{i,j} c_{i,j} * L_i(a) * L_j(b) for each point (a,b)
in the Cartesian product of x and y.

Precondition: The coefficient matrix c must be non-empty (rows > 0 and cols > 0)
Postcondition: The result is a grid where result[i][j] represents the evaluation
of the Laguerre series at point (x[i], y[j]).

Mathematical properties:
1. The result has shape (nx, ny) - same as the Cartesian product of x and y
2. Each element result[i][j] is the sum over all coefficient terms c[k][l] * L_k(x[i]) * L_l(y[j])
3. For constant coefficients (c[0][0] only), the result should be constant
4. The function is linear in the coefficients */
