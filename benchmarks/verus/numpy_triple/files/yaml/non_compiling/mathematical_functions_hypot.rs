/* numpy.hypot: Given the 'legs' of a right triangle, return its hypotenuse.
    
Computes the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of its two legs.
This is equivalent to sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2), but is implemented in a way that
avoids overflow for large values.
    
The function operates element-wise on the input vectors, computing the
hypotenuse for each pair of corresponding elements.

Specification: numpy.hypot returns a vector where each element is the
hypotenuse computed from the corresponding elements of x1 and x2.
    
Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = sqrt(x1[i]² + x2[i]²)
    
Mathematical properties:
1. The result is always non-negative
2. The result follows the Pythagorean theorem
3. The result is symmetric: hypot(a, b) = hypot(b, a)
4. For positive inputs, hypot(a, b) ≥ max(Float.abs(a), Float.abs(b))
5. hypot(0, a) = Float.abs(a) and hypot(a, 0) = Float.abs(a) */
