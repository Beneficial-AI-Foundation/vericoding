/* Returns the sum along the main diagonal of a square matrix.
The trace is the sum of diagonal elements at positions (i, i) for i = 0 to n-1.

Specification: trace computes the sum of the main diagonal elements of a square matrix.
The trace is mathematically defined as the sum of elements x[i][i] for i from 0 to n-1.
This is a fundamental operation in linear algebra with important mathematical properties:
- trace(A + B) = trace(A) + trace(B) (linearity)
- trace(cA) = c * trace(A) (scalar multiplication)
- trace(A) = trace(A^T) (transpose invariance) */
