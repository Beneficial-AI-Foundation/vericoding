/* Unwrap by changing deltas between values to 2*pi complement.
Unwraps radian phase by changing absolute jumps greater than discont to their 2*pi complement.
For consecutive elements with difference > discont, adds/subtracts multiples of period to create continuity.
Specification: unwrap ensures continuity by correcting large phase jumps */
