/* numpy.may_share_memory: Determine if two arrays might share memory.

This function conservatively checks if two arrays might share memory.
A return of True does not necessarily mean that the two arrays share any element.
It just means that they might.

Only the memory bounds of a and b are checked by default.

Specification: may_share_memory returns a boolean indicating whether two arrays might share memory.

Precondition: True (no special preconditions needed)
Postcondition: The function returns a boolean value. If the arrays are identical references,
it must return True. For independent arrays, it may return False.
The function is conservative - it can return True even when arrays don't actually share memory. */
