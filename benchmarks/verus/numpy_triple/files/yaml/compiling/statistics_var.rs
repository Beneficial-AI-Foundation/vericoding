/* Compute the variance of the elements in a vector with specified delta degrees of freedom.
The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean.

Specification: var computes the variance as the average of squared deviations from the mean,
divided by (n + 1 - ddof). The variance measures the spread of a distribution.

Mathematical properties:
1. The result is always non-negative
2. The variance is zero if and only if all elements are equal
3. The computation requires ddof < n + 1 to ensure a positive divisor
4. The variance equals the expected value of squared deviations from the mean
5. Translation invariance: var(a + c) = var(a) for any constant c
6. Scaling property: var(c * a) = c^2 * var(a) for any constant c

The variance formula implemented is:
var = (1/(n+1-ddof)) * sum_{i=0}^{n} (a[i] - mean)^2
where mean = (1/(n+1)) * sum_{i=0}^{n} a[i]

This specification captures both the mathematical definition of variance
and its key properties. When ddof=0, this gives the population variance;
when ddof=1, this gives the sample variance (unbiased estimator). */
