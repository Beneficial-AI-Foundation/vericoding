/* Return a vector of ones with the same length as the input vector.
This is the 1D version of numpy.ones_like which creates a new vector
filled with ones, having the same size as the input vector.

Specification: ones_like returns a vector where every element is 1,
with the same length as the input vector.

Mathematical properties:
1. The result has the same length as the input (enforced by type system)
2. Every element in the result is exactly 1
3. The result is independent of the input values (only depends on shape) */
