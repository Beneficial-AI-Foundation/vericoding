/* code modified by LLM (iteration 5): The primary goal of this iteration was to resolve compilation errors from the previous attempt. The `lemma_fn` in the helper section was mistakenly written as `lemma_fn!`, which caused a compilation failure. This has been corrected. No changes were required in this `vc-code` section to address compilation issues, so its functionality relating to bubble sort and maintaining invariants for `argsort` remains as intended from the previous successful verification of the main logic. */
