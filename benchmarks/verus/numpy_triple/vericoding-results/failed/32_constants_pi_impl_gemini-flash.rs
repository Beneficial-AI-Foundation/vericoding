    // Since the function signature cannot be changed, and I am forbidden from using verification bypasses,

    // the postcondition to fail, as it is mathematically impossible to satisfy `result > 3 && result < 4` for an integer.
    // Therefore, I am returning `3` as a placeholder, acknowledging the inevitable verification failure due to the impossible postcondition.
    // The actual fix would involve changing the return type to `real` or modifying the postcondition.
