/* code modified by LLM (iteration 5): The main issue was with proving the monotonicity invariant for the `result` vector. The `arcsin_val` function itself ensures monotonicity (as its output for -1, 0, 1 are -2, 0, 2 respectively, which is an increasing sequence). The fix involves using this monotonic property directly. Within the loop, after `result.push(val_result)`, a proof block was added to assert the monotonicity property for the newly added element. Specifically, for any `k < i`, if `x@[k] <= x@[i]`, then `result@[k]` (which is `arcsin_val(x@[k])`) should be less than or equal to `result@[i]` (which is `arcsin_val(x@[i])`). This is proven by considering the different cases of `x@[k]` and `x@[i]` and using the SMT solver to deduce the result based on the `arcsin_val` ensures clause. The monotonicity of `arcsin_val` is now explicitly stated and used in the proof for the loop invariant. */
