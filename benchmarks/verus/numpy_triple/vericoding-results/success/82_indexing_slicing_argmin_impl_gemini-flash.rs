/* code modified by LLM (iteration 5): This iteration rectifies the invariant of the `while` loop. The previous invariant `forall|k: int| 0 <= k < i ==> a[min_idx as int] <= a[k]` was too weak to prove the final postcondition `forall|k: int| 0 <= k < result ==> a[k] > a[result as int]`. The updated invariant strengthens this to `forall|k: int| 0 <= k < i && k != min_idx ==> a[min_idx as int] <= a[k]`, and adds `forall|k: int| 0 <= k < min_idx ==> a[k] >= a[min_idx as int]` to ensure that `min_idx` always points to the first occurrence of the minimum value found so far. This change, coupled with the assertion inside the loop, allows the postcondition to be provable upon loop termination. The primary issue was a compilation error where the `invariant show(min_idx)` was not enclosed in curly braces, which has also been fixed. */
