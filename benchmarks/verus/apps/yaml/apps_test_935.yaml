vc-description: |-
  Given a grid with n horizontal and m vertical sticks, two players take turns
  removing intersection points. When an intersection is removed, all sticks 
  passing through it are removed. The player who cannot make a move loses.
  Akshat goes first. Determine the winner when both players play optimally.
