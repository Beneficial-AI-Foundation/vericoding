  Find the worst-case number of button presses needed to open a lock with n buttons.
  The lock has a specific unknown sequence. When a button is pressed:
  - If it's the next correct button, it stays pressed
  - If it's incorrect, all pressed buttons reset
  - The lock opens when all n buttons are pressed simultaneously (sequence complete)
