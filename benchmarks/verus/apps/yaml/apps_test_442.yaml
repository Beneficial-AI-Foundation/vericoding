vc-description: |-
  Given a hash function H(x,y) = xÂ² + 2xy + x + 1 where x and y are positive integers,
  determine if there exists a pair of positive integers (x,y) such that H(x,y) = r 
  for a given positive integer r. If such a pair exists, return the pair (x,y) with 
  the smallest possible value of x. If no such pair exists, return empty sequence.
