vc-description: |-
  Given n+1 pylons numbered 0 to n, where pylon 0 has height 0 and pylons 1 to n have heights h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ.
  A player starts at pylon 0 with 0 energy and wants to reach pylon n by jumping from pylon k to pylon k+1.
  Each jump from pylon k to k+1 changes energy by (hₖ - hₖ₊₁). Energy must remain non-negative at all times.
  The player can pay $1 to increase any pylon's height by 1. Find the minimum cost to make the journey possible.
