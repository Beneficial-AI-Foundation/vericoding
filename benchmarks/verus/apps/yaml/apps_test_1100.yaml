vc-description: |-
  Given a regular convex polygon with n vertices, draw rays from each vertex to all others.
  Rays stop when hitting vertices or intersecting previously drawn rays, creating regions.
  A squirrel starts outside and jumps between adjacent regions to collect all walnuts.
  Find the minimum number of jumps needed.
