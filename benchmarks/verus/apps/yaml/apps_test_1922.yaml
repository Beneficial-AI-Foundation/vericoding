vc-description: |-
  Given an N×M grid of cards (all initially face up), perform one operation for each card position (i,j): 
  flip the card at position (i,j) and all cards in the 8 adjacent positions (sharing a side or corner), 
  if those positions exist in the grid. Determine how many cards face down after all N×M operations are completed.
