vc-description: |-
  Two players Alice and Brown play a turn-based stone game starting with Alice.
  There are two piles with X and Y stones. On each turn, a player chooses positive
  integer i, takes 2i stones from one pile (requiring at least 2i stones),
  discards i stones, and places remaining i stones in the other pile.
  The player who cannot make a valid move loses. Determine winner with optimal play.
