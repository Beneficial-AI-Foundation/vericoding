vc-description: |-
  Given n bus stops at positions a_i (sorted in increasing order), a bus travels back and forth 
  between stops 1 and n in order: 1→2→...→n→(n-1)→...→1→2→... repeatedly.
  Given a segment of the bus journey as a sorted list of stop numbers with their visit frequencies,
  calculate the total distance traveled during this segment, or return -1 if the distance cannot 
  be uniquely determined.
  
  /* Since |visits| >= 1, there must be at least one visit */
  
  /* This means at least one count > 0, so if allZero then maxRounds >= 1 */
