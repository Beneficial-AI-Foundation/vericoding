  Given n students where each student has participated in ACM ICPC championship y_i times (0 ≤ y_i ≤ 5),
  form the maximum number of teams such that: each team has exactly 3 students, no student can be on 
  multiple teams, and each team can participate together at least k more times (since each student can 
  participate at most 5 times total). Find the maximum number of teams that can be formed.
