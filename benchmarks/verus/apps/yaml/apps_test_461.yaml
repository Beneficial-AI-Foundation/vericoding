vc-description: |-
  Find the minimum distance Winnie-the-Pooh must travel to have n meals.
  Winnie starts at Rabbit's house and has his first meal there.
  There are 3 houses: Rabbit, Owl, and Eeyore, forming a triangle.
  Distances: Rabbit↔Owl = a meters, Rabbit↔Eeyore = b meters, Owl↔Eeyore = c meters.
  After each meal, Winnie must leave the current house and go to one of the two adjacent houses.
  He needs n meals total, so he makes (n-1) moves.
  Find the minimum total distance for all moves.
