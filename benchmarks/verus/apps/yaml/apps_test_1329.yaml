vc-description: |-
  Given an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), count how many divisors of N! have exactly 75 divisors.
  A number has exactly 75 divisors if and only if its prime factorization has one of these forms:
  - p^74 (where p is prime)
  - p^24 × q^2 (where p, q are distinct primes)  
  - p^14 × q^4 (where p, q are distinct primes)
  - p^4 × q^4 × r^2 (where p, q, r are distinct primes)
  
  /* Abstract specification - represents the count of divisors of N! that have exactly 75 divisors */
