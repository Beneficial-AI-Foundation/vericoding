  Given n tiles numbered 1 to n, paint tiles according to rules:
  - Tile can be painted Red if divisible by a (gives p chocolates)
  - Tile can be painted Blue if divisible by b (gives q chocolates)  
  - If divisible by both a and b, choose the color giving more chocolates
  Find the maximum total chocolates possible.
