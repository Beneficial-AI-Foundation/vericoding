  Vasya needs to drive to house number a on a street with n houses (n is even).
  Odd-numbered houses are on one side from beginning to end, even-numbered houses
  are on the other side from end to beginning. Distance from beginning to houses
  1 and n is 1 unit, and consecutive houses on same side are 1 unit apart.
  Find minimum time to reach house a from street beginning.
