  Find minimum cost to travel from city 1 to city n on a straight line where adjacent cities are 1 km apart,
  roads are directional (can only go from lower to higher numbered cities), car has fuel tank capacity v liters
  consuming 1 liter per km, and each city i sells fuel at i dollars per liter.
