vc-description: |-
  Given integers n and r, determine the number of distinct shapes that can be formed
  by painting n consecutive days on calendars where a week can have k days (1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ r).
  Days are arranged left-to-right in rows, wrapping to the next row when reaching 
  the end of a week. All painted cells must be connected by sides. Two shapes are 
  considered the same if one can be moved to exactly overlap the other using only 
  parallel translations.
