vc-description: |-
  Find the minimum positive integer x such that x is divisible by n and x ends with k or more zeros in base 10.
  A number ends with k zeros if and only if it's divisible by 10^k = 2^k Ã— 5^k.
  Algorithm: Factor out powers of 2 and 5 from n, then multiply n by additional factors needed to achieve k trailing zeros.
