vc-description: |-
  Given n types of pebbles with w_i pebbles of type i, and a person with 2 pockets 
  that can each hold at most k pebbles, find the minimum number of days needed to 
  collect all pebbles. Different pebble types cannot be mixed in the same pocket, 
  both pockets can be used simultaneously on the same day, and each pebble type 
  must be collected completely.
