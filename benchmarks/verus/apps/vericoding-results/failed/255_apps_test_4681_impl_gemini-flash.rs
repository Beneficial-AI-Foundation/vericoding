/* code modified by LLM (iteration 5): Fixed compilation error by removing `as int` casts for runtime variables `a` and `b` when they are used in arithmetic operations, also ensuring the result of the addition `b_val + a_val` is within `i8` range before casting.  Moved lucas relation proof block to top of loop and adjusted invariant related to `i+2` for better clarity. */
