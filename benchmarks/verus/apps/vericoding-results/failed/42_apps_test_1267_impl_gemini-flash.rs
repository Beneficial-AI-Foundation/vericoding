/* code modified by LLM (iteration 5): The previous iteration had a compilation error due to using `nat` and `int` for indexing and casting in executable code. I fixed this by ensuring all variables used in executable contexts are concrete types (`i8` for `current_score_int`), and casting to `int` only for ghost contexts (Set operations, specifications). The logic for counting unique non-zero scores remains the same, but the type handling is now correct for compilation. */
