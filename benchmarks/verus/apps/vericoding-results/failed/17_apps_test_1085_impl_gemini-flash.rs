/* code modified by LLM (iteration 5): The primary issue was the usage of `nat` and `int` in ghost contexts. Switched types for `reduced_nat` and `reduced_other_nat` to `nat` and wrapped arithmetic operations with `as int` to comply with ghost code restrictions. Corrected variable `j` type to `nat` in the `Set` definition for `special_divisors_count` to resolve the `nat_integral` error. Adjusted loop bounds to correctly iterate up to the square root to find divisors. Removed unnecessary `checked_sub` and `unwrap_or` for expressions already in ghost context where `int` is allowed. */
