vc-description: |-
  Given n winter days with temperature forecasts, minimize tire changes to drive safely.
  Start with summer tires (safe when temp >= 0). Winter tires safe at any temp but 
  limited to k days total. Must drive safely every day. Can change tires at start of any day.
  Return minimum tire changes needed, or -1 if impossible.
