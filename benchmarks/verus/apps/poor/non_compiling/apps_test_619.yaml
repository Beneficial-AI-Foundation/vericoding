That's a more specific error. Let me break this back down into a working YAML format that can fit the required constraints:

vc-description: |-
  Sasha has x chizhiks and Masha has y chizhiks. Coconuts cost z chizhiks each.
  Find the maximum number of coconuts they can buy together by potentially exchanging
  chizhiks, and determine the minimum number of chizhiks that must be exchanged.

vc-preamble: |-
  use vstd::prelude::*;

  verus! {

  spec fn valid_input(x: int, y: int, z: int) -> bool {
      x >= 0 && y >= 0 && z > 0
  }
  
  spec fn max_coconuts(x: int, y: int, z: int) -> int {
      (x + y) / z
  }
  
  spec fn min_exchange(x: int, y: int, z: int) -> int {
      let rx = x % z;
      let ry = y % z;
      if rx + ry < z { 0 } else { z - if rx > ry { rx } else { ry } }
  }
