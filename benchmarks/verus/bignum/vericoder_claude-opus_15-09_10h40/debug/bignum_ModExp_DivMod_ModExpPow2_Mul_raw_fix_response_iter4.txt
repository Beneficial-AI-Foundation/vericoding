=== Raw LLM Fix Response - Iteration 4 ===
Length: 6774 characters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Looking at the verification errors, I need to fix several issues:

1. The `pow_mod_lemma` needs to handle the modular arithmetic property correctly
2. The `int_to_bitstring` function has invariant issues with bit ordering
3. The `bitstring_to_int` function has overflow issues and invariant problems
4. The main function has precondition failures and invariant issues

The key insight is that `Str2Int` processes bits from right to left (LSB first), but the current implementation processes them incorrectly.
