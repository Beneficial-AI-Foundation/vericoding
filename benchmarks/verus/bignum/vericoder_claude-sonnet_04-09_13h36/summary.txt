Max iterations: 10
Parallel workers: 4
Test date: 2025-09-04T09:02:09.000000

Total original files: 62

=== OVERALL STATISTICS ===
Total successful: 4
Total failed: 58
Success rate: 6.5%

Successful files:
✓ bignum_Add_NormalizeBitString.rs
✓ bignum_ModExp_Add_DivMod_ModExpPow2_Zeroes.rs
✓ bignum_ModExp_Add_ModExpPow2_Mul.rs
✓ bignums_Sub_NormalizeBitstring.rs

Failed files:
All remaining 58 files failed Verus verification

=== NOTES ===
- This run originally processed only 57/62 files from W&B run oxboxa45
- Missing 5 files were copied from vericoder_claude-opus_04-09_13h36 as failed implementations
- Actual success rate based on Verus verification results: 4/62 = 6.5%
- 521 verification failures recorded in output.log

=== PARALLEL PROCESSING FEATURES ===
Parallel workers: 4
API rate limiting: 1s between calls
Debug mode: Enabled
- Saves original specification as *_iter_0_original.rs
- Saves initial generated code as *_iter_1_generated.rs
- Saves current working version for each iteration as *_iter_N_current.rs
- Saves final implementation as *_impl.rs
- Full debugging: all intermediate files are saved
