=== Raw LLM Fix Response - Iteration 2 ===
Length: 5190 characters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Looking at the verification errors, I need to fix:

1. In the helper section: The assertion at line 27 fails because we need to use associativity of multiplication properly
2. In the code section: The assertion at line 95 fails, and there's an arithmetic overflow at line 98

Let me fix both sections:
