  // But for the output, at the end, it's // </vc-code>

  // So just the body content.

  // Each is the code that goes inside the {}

  // So first json string is the body for Add.

  // Second for DivMod, including the num_to_bits function if needed.

  // But num_to_bits is inside, yes.

  // Similarly for mul_mod.

  // For ModExp, I can include the helper function inside the code.

  // But to avoid assume, I need real code.

  // Let's try to write proper implementations.

  // First, for binary addition, as above.

  // Second, for division, use the number conversion.

  // But to prove, need to ensure it's correct, but since no assume, the code must be correct per specs.

  // Third, for ModExp, use the binary exponentiation with mul_mod.

  // And include mul_mod inside the code.

  // Since it's exec, not spec, can include function insides.

  // But in Verus, exec function can call other functions.

  // Since it's single file, I can add the helper at the top, but the task is to replace only the <vc-code>, no <vc-helpers>.

  // The file has no <vc-helpers>, but the task mentions generating for <vc-helpers>, but in this input, none.

  // So to make it work, perhaps inline the helpers.

  // Or define them inside.

  // To keep, let's adjust the response to have only three strings.

For the first one:

The code for Add, with the reversed version to handle LSB addition.

But actually, the binary addition is fine, as long as the spec is met.

I think the code is ok.

For DivMod, I have the num_to_bits inline.

For ModExp, I have mul_mod inside, but defined as fn, but in exec, can't define fn inside.

Verus doesn't allow inner functions in exec, I think.

So need to avoid that.

To compute the numbers, I can use loops without helpers.

For simplicity, provide the code.

Let's assign the three strings properly.

First, the body for Add:

"{\n  let mut carry = 0;\n  let mut result = Vec::new();\n  let len1 = s1.len();\n  let len2 = s2.len();\n  let max_len = if len1 > len2 { len1 } else { len2 };\n  let mut i = 0;\n  while i < max_len {\n    let bit1 = if i < len1 { if s1[i] == '1' { 1 } else { 0 } } else { 0 };\n    let bit2 = if i < len2 { if s2[i] == '1' { 1 } else { 0 } } else { 0 };\n    let sum = bit1 + bit2 + carry;\n    result.push(if sum % 2 == 1 { '1' } else { '0' });\n    carry = sum / 2;\n    i += 1;\n  }\n  if carry > 0 {\n    result.push('1');\n  }\n  result\n}"

But to match MSB, perhaps reverse.

Assume index 0 is MSB, then to add, start from the end.

The input is &[char], so s1[0] is MSB.

So to add, treat as MSB first, reverse for LSB addition.

Yes, that's what I had in the first response.

For DivMod, use the loop for subtraction.

To simplify, use the number calculation, but since Verus has nat, but looping to convert number back.

Since the spec uses Str2Int, which is recursive, but for looped, the decreases is needed.

In Verus, for loop with decreases, but for number to bits, I can use while n > 0 decreases n.

Yes.

Let's write:

For DivMod:

"{\n  let dividend_num = 0;\n  for bit in s1 {\n    dividend_num = 2 * dividend_num + if bit == '1' { 1 } else { 0 };\n  }\n  let divisor_num = 0;\n  for bit in s2 {\n    divisor_num = 2 * divisor_num + if bit == '1' { 1 } else { 0 };\n  }\n  let quotient_num = dividend_num / divisor_num;\n  let remainder_num = dividend_num % divisor_num;\n  let mut quotient = Vec::new();\n  if quotient_num == 0 {\n    quotient.push('0');\n  } else {\n    let mut temp = quotient_num;\n    while temp > 0 {\n      quotient.push(if temp % 2 == 1 { '1' } else { '0' });\n      temp = temp / 2;\n    }\n    quotient.reverse();\n  }\n  let mut remainder = Vec::new();\n  if remainder_num == 0 {\n    remainder.push('0');\n  } else {\n    let mut temp = remainder_num;\n    while temp > 0 {\n      remainder.push(if temp % 2 == 1 { '1' } else { '0' });\n      temp = temp / 2;\n    }\n    remainder.reverse();\n  }\n  (quotient, remainder)\n}"

Yes, that works, assuming nat is ok.

For ModExp, similarly, but since exp can be large, but in Verus, looping with decreases sy@.len(), but the spec has decreases sy@.len(), so for the body, use binary method with the loop decreases length.

But for mul_mod, need to implement multiplication mod, which again, if se using numbers, same issue.

To avoid large numbers, perhaps implement bit shifting and subtraction for mod.

But that might be complex.

Since the spec allows using Str2Int, I can compute the numbers, do the operation, then convert back, as long as it's provable.

But in Verus, to prove the ensures, the code must match, but since no assume, the code will be verified to meet the specs, assuming the spec for Str2Int etc are correct.

I think it's ok.

For ModExp, the code would be:

"{\n  let base_num = 0;\n  for bit in sx {\n    base_num = 2 * base_num + if bit == '1' { 1 } else { 0 };\n  }\n  let exp_num = 0;\n  for bit in sy {\n    exp_num = 2 * exp_num + if bit == '1' { 1 } else { 0 };\n  }\n  let mod_num = 0;\n  for bit in sz {\n    mod_num = 2 * mod_num + if bit == '1' { 1 } else { 0 };\n  }\n  let mut result_num = 1;\n  let mut current_base = base_num % mod_num;\n  while exp_num > 0 {\n    if exp_num % 2 == 1 {\n      result_num = (result_num * current_base) % mod_num;\n    }\n    current_base = (current_base * current_base) % mod_num;\n    exp_num = exp_num / 2;\n  }\n  let mut result = Vec::new();\n  if result_num == 0 {\n    result.push('0');\n  } else {\n    let mut temp = result_num;\n    while temp > 0 {\n      result.push(if temp % 2 == 1 { '1' } else { '0' });\n      temp = temp / 2;\n    }\n    result.reverse();\n  }\n  result\n}"

This should meet the spec, since the ensures Str2Int(res@) == Exp_int(Str2Int(sx@), Str2Int(sy@)) % Str2Int(sz@), and Exp_int is provided, but since exp ranges over nat, and Truth is recursive, but in Verus, recursive functions can have proofs.

I think this is acceptable.

Now, to output the JSON, with exactly three strings.

Note: nat is used, but in Verus, nat is fine.

The variables are of type nat.

Yes.

The response is [ "first code as string", "second", "third" ]

The first for Add, second for DivMod, third for ModExp.

For Add, since it's MSB first, the addition in the code I had earlier was for index 0 as MSB, but addition started from i=0, which is MSB, but to add, we add LSBs, so I need to reverse.

Let's adjust the code for Add.

To correctly implement binary addition for MSB first.

The standard way is to reverse the bit strings, add from LSB to MSB, then reverse back.

Yes, that's what I had in the first response.

So use that.

Let's finalize the codes.

First: the reversed version.

Second: the DivMod code above.

Third: the ModExp code above.

Yes. 

The JSON will be a list of these three strings.

Ensure the strings are properly escaped, but since it's code, no special characters, but newlines are \n as in the example.

The example uses \n for newlines.

But in the output, it should be literal \n in the string.

Yes.

So, the response is the JSON array.["{\n  let rev_s1: Vec<char> = s1.iter().rev().cloned().collect();\n  let rev_s2: Vec<char> = s2.iter().rev().cloned().collect();\n  let mut carry = 0;\n  let mut result = Vec::new();\n  let len1 = rev_s1.len();\n  let len2 = rev_s2.len();\n  let max_len = if len1 > len2 { len1 } else { len2 };\n  let mut i = 0;\n  while i < max_len {\n    let bit1 = if i < len1 { if rev_s1[i] == '1' { 1 } else { 0 } } else { 0 };\n    let bit2 = if i < len2 { if rev_s2[i] == '1' { 1 } else { 0 } } else { 0 };\n    let sum = bit1 + bit2 + carry;\n    result.push(if sum % 2 == 1 { '1' } else { '0' });\n    carry = sum / 2;\n    i += 1;\n  }\n  if carry > 0 {\n    result.push('1');\n  }\n  result.reverse();\n  result\n}", "{\n  let dividend_num = 0;\n  for bit in s1 {\n    dividend_num = 2 * dividend_num + if *bit == '1' { 1 } else { 0 };\n  }\n  let divisor_num = 0;\n  for bit in s2 {\n    divisor_num = 2 * divisor_num + if *bit == '1' { 1 } else { 0 };\n  }\n  let quotient_num = dividend_num / divisor_num;\n  let remainder_num = dividend_num % divisor_num;\n  let mut quotient = Vec::new();\n  if quotient_num == 0 {\n    quotient.push('0');\n  } else {\n    let mut temp = quotient_num;\n    while temp > 0 {\n      quotient.push(if temp % 2 == 1 { '1' } else { '0' });\n      temp = temp / 2;\n    }\n    quotient.reverse();\n  }\n  let mut remainder = Vec::new();\n  if remainder_num == 0 {\n    remainder.push('0');\n  } else {\n    let mut temp = remainder_num;\n    while temp > 0 {\n      remainder.push(if temp % 2 == 1 { '1' } else { '0' });\n      temp = temp / 2;\n    }\n    remainder.reverse();\n  }\n  (quotient, remainder)\n}", "{\n  let base_num = 0;\n  for bit in sx {\n    base_num = 2 * base_num + if *bit == '1' { 1 } else { 0 };\n  }\n  let exp_num = 0;\n  for bit in sy {\n    exp_num = 2 * exp_num + if *bit == '1' { 1 } else { 0 };\n  }\n  let mod_num = 0;\n  for bit in sz {\n    mod_num = 2 * mod_num + if *bit == '1' { 1 } else { 0 };\n  }\n  let mut result_num = 1;\n  let mut current_base = base_num % mod_num;\n  let mut temp_exp = exp_num;\n  while temp_exp > 0 {\n    if temp_exp % 2 == 1 {\n      result_num = (result_num * current_base) % mod_num;\n    }\n    current_base = (current_base * current_base) % mod_num;\n    temp_exp = temp_exp / 2;\n  }\n  let mut result = Vec::new();\n  if result_num == 0 {\n    result.push('0');\n  } else {\n    let mut temp = result_num;\n    while temp > 0 {\n      result.push(if temp % 2 == 1 { '1' } else { '0' });\n      temp = temp / 2;\n    }\n    result.reverse();\n  }\n  result\n}"]
