  The notorious hacker group "Sed" managed to obtain a string S from their secret sources. The string contains only lowercase English letters along with the character '?'.
  A substring of S is a contiguous subsequence of that string. For example, the string "chef" is a substring of the string "codechef", but the string "codeh" is not a substring of "codechef".
  A substring of S is good if it is possible to choose a lowercase English letter C such that the following process succeeds:
  - Create a string R, which is a copy of the substring, but with each '?' replaced by the letter c. Note that all occurrences of '?' must be replaced by the same letter.
  - For each lowercase English letter:
  - Compute the number of times it occurs in S and the number of times it occurs in R; let's denote them by A and B respectively. The '?' characters in the original string S are ignored when computing A.
  - Check the parity of A and B. If they do not have the same parity, i.e. one of them is even while the other is odd, then this process fails.
  - If the parities of the number of occurrences in S and R are the same for each letter, the process succeeds.
  For different substrings, we may choose different values of C.
  Help Sed find the number of good substrings in the string S.
