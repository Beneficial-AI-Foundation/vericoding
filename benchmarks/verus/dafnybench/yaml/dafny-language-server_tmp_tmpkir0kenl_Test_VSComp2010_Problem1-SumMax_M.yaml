  // VSComp 2010, problem 1, compute the sum and max of the elements of an array and prove
  
  // that 'sum <= N * max'.
  
  // Rustan Leino, 18 August 2010.
  
  //
  
  // The problem statement gave the pseudo-code for the method, but did not ask to prove
  
  // that 'sum' or 'max' return as the sum and max, respectively, of the array.  The
  
  // given assumption that the array's elements are non-negative is not needed to establish
  
  // the requested postcondition.
