  /* https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
  Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
  
  Example 1:
  Input: s = "abcabcbb"
  Output: 3
  Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

  /* Discussions
  1. The "sliding window" technique is the most "fancy" part of the solution,
    ensuring an O(n) time despite the O(n^2) search space.
    The reason why it works lies in the last two invariants: (A) and (B).
  
    Invariant (A) is simply a "partial" guarantee for the longest valid substring in `s[..hi]`,
    so once the loop finishes, as `hi == |s|`, this "partial" guarantee becomes "full".
  
    Invariant (B) is crucial: it encodes why we can monotonically increase `lo` as we increase `hi`.
    What's the "intuition" behind that? Let me share an "informal proof" below:
  
      Let `sub(i)` be the longest valid substring whose last character is `s[i]`.
      Apparently, the final answer will be "the longest among the longests", i.e.
      `max(|sub(0)|, |sub(1)|, ..., |sub(|s|-1)|)`.
  
      Now, notice that the "starting position" of `sub(i)` is monotonically increasing regarding `i`!
      Otherwise, imagine `sub(i+1)` started at `j` while `sub(i)` started at `j+1` (or even worse),
      then `sub(i)` could be made longer (by starting at `j` instead).
      This is an obvious contradiction.
  
      Therefore, when we search for the starting position of `sub(i)` (the `lo`) for each `i` (the `hi`),
      there's no need to "look back".
  
  2. The solution above can be made more efficient, using "jumping window" instead of "sliding window".
    Namely, we use a dict (instead of set) to look up the "position of repetition",
    and move `lo` right after that position at once.
  
    You can even "early terminate" (based on `lo`) when all remaining intervals are doomed "no longer",
    resulting in even fewer number of loop iterations.
    (Time complexity will still be O(n), though.)
  
    The corresponding verification code is shown below:

  // For verification simplicity, we pretend as if:
  // - `map` were Python dict (or even better, a fixed-size array -- if the "alphabet" is small)
  
  // Bonus Question:
  //   "Why can we safely use (C) instead of (D) as the loop condition? Won't `hi` go out-of-bound?"
  // Can you figure it out?
