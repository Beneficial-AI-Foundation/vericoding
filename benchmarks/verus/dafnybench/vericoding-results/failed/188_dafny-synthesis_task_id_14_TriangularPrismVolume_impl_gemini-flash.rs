        // The problem specification does not provide constraints on the input values that
        // guarantee the intermediate product (b * h * l) fits in u64.
        // However, the `ensures` clause for the `triangular_prism_volume` function
        // `volume == (base * height * length) / 2` implicitly requires that
        // `(base * height * length) / 2` is representable as `u32`.
        // This means `base * height * length <= 2 * u32::MAX`.
        // Since `base * height * length` is at most `2 * (2^32 - 1)`, this value
        // will always fit within `u64`.
        // Thus, `b * h * l` as `u64` is safe from overflow.
