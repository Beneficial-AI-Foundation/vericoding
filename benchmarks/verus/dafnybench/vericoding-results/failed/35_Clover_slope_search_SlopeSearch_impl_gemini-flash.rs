    // This point should not be reached if the key is guaranteed to exist.

    // should imply that for any (r,c) such that a[r][c] == key, we must have
    // `r >= num_rows` (impossible) or `c < 0` (impossible).
    // This implies that we must have found the key within the loop.
    // However, Verus requires a return value if the loop finishes without returning.
    // We add a dummy return statement that should not be reached due to the postcondition.

    // If we reach here, it means the key was not found within the loop.
    // This contradicts the precondition that the key exists.
    // We need to provide a pair that satisfies the postcondition, so we must prove
    // that this code path is unreachable.
    // The invariant ensures that if the key exists, when the loop terminates,
    // row must be >= num_rows or col < 0.
    // But this implies there's no (r,c) such that key is at a[r][c] AND r >= row && c <= col.
    // This contradicts the invariant that such (r,c) exists.
    // Thus, the loop must return inside.

    // To satisfy Verus, we can return (0,0) and let the ens_diverges handle it,
    // or provide a crash, but it's better to prove it's unreachable.
    // The specification's `exists` clause implies that one of the `return` branches
    // will be taken.
    // However, if Verus struggles to see this, we can fall back to the first possible index.

    // This part of the code should be unreachable if the key exists, as guaranteed by the precondition.
    // Adding a dummy return that satisfies the basic type requirements,
    // Verus's proof engine is expected to show this code is unreachable
    // given the loop invariant and termination condition combined with the precondition.

    // Force a panic to highlight if this path is ever reached, as it should not be.
    // Even better, make Verus prove it's unreachable by the invariant.
    // For now, since Verus needs a concrete return value even if unreachable:
    return (0, 0); // This line is logically unreachable.
