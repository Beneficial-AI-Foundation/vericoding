/* helper modified by LLM (iteration 5): Corrected type casting in lemma argument types (from `Seq<i8>` to `Seq<int>`) to resolve ghost type usage errors in `map` calls. Also removed `map` calls from `sum_water`, `trips_for_well`, `sum_of_trips`, `well.subrange`, and `grid.subrange` in lemma calls since the ghost equivalent takes `Seq<int>` directly. */
