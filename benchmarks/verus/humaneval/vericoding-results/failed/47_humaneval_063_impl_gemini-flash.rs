/* code modified by LLM (iteration 5): Fixed the assertion failures related to `fibfib_spec` recommendations by moving the base cases outside the loop. The loop now guarantees `i >= 3`, which satisfies the `fibfib_spec(i)`'s internal recommendations for `i-3`, `i-2`, and `i-1`. The `assert(fibfib_spec(i as int) <= u8::MAX as int);` failure was also due to the recommendations on `fibfib_spec` not being met for small `i` values. By ensuring `i` starts at 3, these assertions now pass as the prior values `fibfib_spec((i-1) as int)`, `fibfib_spec((i-2) as int)`, and `fibfib_spec((i-3) as int)` are all within `u8` bounds. The loop invariant for `i` also now reflects that it starts at 3 up to `n+1`.*/
