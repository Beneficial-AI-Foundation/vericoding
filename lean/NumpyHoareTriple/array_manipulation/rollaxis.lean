/-- numpy.rollaxis: Roll the specified axis backwards, until it lies in a given position.
    
    For 1D arrays, this is a no-op - it returns the input array unchanged.
    This is because with only one axis (axis 0), there's nowhere to roll it to.
    The axis and start parameters are ignored in the 1D case.
    
    Note: This function is deprecated in favor of moveaxis, but we provide
    the specification for completeness.

/-- Specification: numpy.rollaxis returns the input vector unchanged for 1D arrays.
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for 1D rollaxis)
    Postcondition: The result is identical to the input vector
    
    Mathematical property: For 1D arrays, rollaxis is the identity function
    since there's only one axis that cannot be moved.
