/-- Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.
    
    This implementation focuses on the most common case: reshaping a 1D array
    to another 1D array with the same total number of elements. The elements
    are preserved in the same linear order (C-order).
    
    For simplicity, this specification handles only 1D to 1D reshaping where
    the sizes are explicitly equal. More complex reshaping operations (like
    multidimensional arrays or -1 inference) would require additional machinery.

/-- Specification: reshape preserves all elements in their linear order.
    
    The reshape operation creates a new vector with a different size parameter
    but maintains the same elements in the same order. This is the fundamental
    property of reshape - it's purely a "view" operation that doesn't modify data.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. Size preservation: The total number of elements remains constant
    2. Order preservation: Elements appear in the same linear sequence
    3. Value preservation: Each element value is unchanged
    
    Precondition: The new shape must have the same total size as the original
    Postcondition: Each element at index i in the result equals the element
                   at the corresponding index in the original array
