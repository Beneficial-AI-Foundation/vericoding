/-- Add one Hermite series to another. Component-wise addition of polynomial coefficients. -/
def hermeadd {n m : Nat} (c1 : Vector Float n) (c2 : Vector Float m) : Id (Vector Float (max n m)) :=
  sorry

/-- Specification: hermeadd performs component-wise addition of Hermite polynomial coefficients.
    The result has the length of the longer input vector. Elements are added where both vectors
    have coefficients, and remaining coefficients from the longer vector are preserved.
    
    This models the mathematical property that polynomial addition is component-wise:
    (a₀ + a₁x + a₂x² + ...) + (b₀ + b₁x + b₂x² + ...) = (a₀+b₀) + (a₁+b₁)x + (a₂+b₂)x² + ...
    
    Additional mathematical properties:
    - Commutativity: hermeadd c1 c2 = hermeadd c2 c1
    - Associativity: hermeadd (hermeadd c1 c2) c3 = hermeadd c1 (hermeadd c2 c3)
    - Zero identity: hermeadd c (zero vector) = c (extended appropriately)
    - Preservation of polynomial structure: addition preserves Hermite polynomial properties
