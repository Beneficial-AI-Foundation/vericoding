/-- numpy.polynomial.hermite.hermmul: Multiply one Hermite series by another.

    Returns the product of two Hermite series c1 * c2. The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order term to highest,
    e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2 where P_i
    is the i-th Hermite polynomial.

    The product of two Hermite series requires reprojection onto the
    Hermite basis, which uses the recurrence relation for Hermite
    polynomials.

    For non-empty inputs of length m and n, the result has length m + n - 1.
    For empty inputs, returns a single zero coefficient.

/-- Specification: hermmul returns the coefficients of the product of two
    Hermite series.

    The key mathematical properties:
    1. Empty input handling: If either input is empty, returns [0]
    2. Degree property: For non-empty inputs of degree m-1 and n-1,
       the product has degree (m-1) + (n-1) = m + n - 2, requiring m + n - 1 coefficients
    3. Multiplication by constant: When one series has only one coefficient (constant polynomial),
       the result is element-wise scaling
    4. Commutativity: hermmul c1 c2 = hermmul c2 c1 (up to floating point precision)
    5. The general multiplication follows Hermite polynomial recurrence relations

    Precondition: True (works for all valid inputs)
    Postcondition: Captures empty input behavior, constant multiplication, and size properties
