/-- numpy.corrcoef: Return Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients.

    The correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two variables.
    For two vectors x and y, the correlation coefficient is computed as:
    
    corr(x, y) = cov(x, y) / (std(x) * std(y))
    
    Where:
    - cov(x, y) is the covariance between x and y
    - std(x) and std(y) are the standard deviations of x and y
    
    This function computes the correlation coefficient between two vectors of observations.
    The result is bounded between -1 and 1, where:
    - 1 indicates perfect positive correlation
    - -1 indicates perfect negative correlation  
    - 0 indicates no linear correlation
    
    Requires non-empty vectors and non-zero variance in both variables.

/-- Specification: corrcoef computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between two vectors.

    The correlation coefficient satisfies several mathematical properties:
    1. Symmetry: corr(x, y) = corr(y, x)
    2. Bounded: -1 ≤ corr(x, y) ≤ 1
    3. Self-correlation: corr(x, x) = 1 (if x has non-zero variance)
    4. Scale invariance: correlation is preserved under linear transformations
    
    Precondition: Both vectors have non-zero variance (not all elements equal)
    Postcondition: Result is bounded between -1 and 1, and captures linear relationship
