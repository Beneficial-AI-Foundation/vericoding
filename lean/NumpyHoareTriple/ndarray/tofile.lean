/-- numpy.ndarray.tofile: Write array to a file as text or binary data.
    
    Writes the array data to a file in 'C' order (row-major), independent of the
    original array order. The data can be recovered using numpy.fromfile().
    
    This operation converts the array elements to their binary or text representation
    and writes them sequentially to the specified file.

/-- Specification: numpy.ndarray.tofile writes array data to a file in a format
    that preserves all original data and can be recovered by fromfile.
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for file writing)
    Postcondition: The operation succeeds (returns unit) and the file contains
    a faithful representation of the array data in 'C' order, preserving:
    1. The number of elements (file_data.length = n)
    2. The exact values in sequential order
    3. All elements are written without loss of precision
    
    This ensures the fundamental property that tofile and fromfile are inverses
    when used with the same data format.
