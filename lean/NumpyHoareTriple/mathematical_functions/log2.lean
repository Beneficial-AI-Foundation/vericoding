/-- numpy.log2: Base-2 logarithm of x, element-wise.

    The base-2 logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function with base 2,
    so that log2(2^x) = x. This is useful for computing the number of bits needed
    to represent a number or for operations involving powers of 2.

    Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the base-2 logarithm
    of each element in x.

  sorry

/-- Specification: log2 returns a vector where each element is the base-2
    logarithm of the corresponding element in x.

    Precondition: All elements must be positive (x[i] > 0) since the logarithm
    is only defined for positive real numbers.
    
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = Float.log2 x[i]
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - log2(2^x) = x for any x
    - log2(x * y) = log2(x) + log2(y) for positive x, y
    - log2(x / y) = log2(x) - log2(y) for positive x, y
    - log2(1) = 0
    - log2(2) = 1
