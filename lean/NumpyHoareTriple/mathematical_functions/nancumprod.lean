/-- Specification: nancumprod returns the cumulative product while treating NaN values as 1.
    This means:
    1. The resulting array has the same size as the input
    2. Each element is the product of all non-NaN elements from the start up to that position
    3. NaN values are treated as 1 in the product calculation
    4. Leading NaNs are replaced by ones
    5. The cumulative product property holds for non-NaN values -/
