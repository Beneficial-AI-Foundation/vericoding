/-- numpy.around: Evenly round to the given number of decimals (alias for numpy.round).
    Uses banker's rounding (round half to even) for values exactly halfway between rounded decimal values.
    For example: 1.5 and 2.5 both round to 2.0, -0.5 and 0.5 both round to 0.0 -/

/-- Specification: around rounds each element to the given number of decimals with the following properties:
    1. Basic rounding: rounds to nearest representable value at the specified decimal precision
    2. Banker's rounding: for values exactly halfway between rounded decimal values, rounds to nearest even
    3. Zero preservation: rounding zero always produces zero
    4. Order preservation: maintains relative ordering of elements
    5. Bounded difference: the rounded value is close to the original value
    6. Idempotency: rounding an already-rounded value doesn't change it -/
