/-- numpy.log: Natural logarithm, element-wise.
    
    The natural logarithm log is the inverse of the exponential function,
    so that log(exp(x)) = x. The natural logarithm is logarithm base e.
    
    Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the natural logarithm
    of each element in x.
    
    Note: The domain of the natural logarithm is the positive real numbers.
    Mathematically, log(x) is undefined for x ≤ 0.

/-- Specification: log returns a vector where each element is the natural
    logarithm of the corresponding element in x.
    
    Precondition: All elements must be positive (x[i] > 0)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = log(x[i])
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - log is the inverse of exp: log(exp(x)) = x
    - log(1) = 0
    - log(e) = 1
    - log(x*y) = log(x) + log(y) for positive x, y
    - log is strictly increasing on (0, ∞)
