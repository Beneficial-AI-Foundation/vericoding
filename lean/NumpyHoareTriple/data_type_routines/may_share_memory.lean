/-- numpy.may_share_memory: Determine if two arrays might share memory.

    This function conservatively checks if two arrays might share memory.
    A return of True does not necessarily mean that the two arrays share any element.
    It just means that they might.

    Only the memory bounds of a and b are checked by default.

/-- Specification: may_share_memory returns a boolean indicating whether two arrays might share memory.

    Precondition: True (no special preconditions needed)
    Postcondition: The function returns a boolean value. If the arrays are identical references,
    it must return True. For independent arrays, it may return False.
    The function is conservative - it can return True even when arrays don't actually share memory.
