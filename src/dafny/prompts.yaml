generate_code: |
  The task is to generate implementations for `<vc-code>` sections in a Dafny file.
  
  INPUT: a Dafny file containing {placeholder_count} `<vc-code>` tags around placeholder implementations that need to be filled in.
  
  OUTPUT: Return a JSON array with EXACTLY {placeholder_count} replacements (one for each `<vc-code>` section in the file), in order from top to bottom:
  ```json
  ["{{\n  prefixes := [];\n  // implementation here\n}}", "{{\n  // second implementation\n}}"]
  ```
  
  CRITICAL RULES:
  - The ORIGINAL file contains EXACTLY {placeholder_count} `<vc-code>` sections - your JSON array must have EXACTLY {placeholder_count} elements
  - Provide exactly one replacement for each `<vc-code>` section in the file, in the exact order they appear (top to bottom)
  - Each replacement should be the exact code that will replace everything between the `<vc-code>` tags
  - Include opening/closing braces if they were in the original `<vc-code>` content
  - AVOID verification bypasses: `{{:axiom}}`, `assume` statements, or other verification shortcuts
  - Use valid Dafny syntax for all implementations
  - Satisfy all `requires` and `ensures` clauses from the method/function specifications
  - Do not add trivial or unnecessary annotations
  - Return ONLY a valid JSON array, no explanations or markdown
  
  DAFNY FILE WITH <vc-code> SECTIONS:
  {code}

fix_verification: |
  The task is to fix implementations in `<vc-code>` sections that failed verification.
  
  INPUT: The ORIGINAL file contains {placeholder_count} `<vc-code>` sections that need to be fixed based on verification errors.
  
  OUTPUT: Return a JSON array with EXACTLY {placeholder_count} fixed replacements (one for each `<vc-code>` section in the ORIGINAL file), in order from top to bottom:
  ```json
  ["{{\n  prefixes := [];\n  // fixed implementation here\n}}", "{{\n  // second fixed implementation\n}}"]
  ```
  
  CRITICAL RULES:
  - The ORIGINAL file contains EXACTLY {placeholder_count} `<vc-code>` sections - your JSON array must have EXACTLY {placeholder_count} elements
  - Provide exactly one replacement for each `<vc-code>` section in the file, in the exact order they appear (top to bottom)
  - Each replacement should be the exact fixed code that will replace everything between the `<vc-code>` tags
  - Include opening/closing braces if they were in the original `<vc-code>` content
  - PRIORITY: If the error is a compilation error (syntax, type, resolution errors), fix it first before addressing verification issues
  - MINIMIZE verification bypasses: `{{:axiom}}`, `assume` statements, or other verification shortcuts
  - Use valid Dafny syntax for all implementations
  - Satisfy all `requires` and `ensures` clauses from the method/function specifications
  - Do not add trivial or unnecessary annotations
  - Add comment `/* code modified by LLM (iteration {iteration}): [brief description] */` before modified code
  - Return ONLY a valid JSON array, no explanations or markdown
