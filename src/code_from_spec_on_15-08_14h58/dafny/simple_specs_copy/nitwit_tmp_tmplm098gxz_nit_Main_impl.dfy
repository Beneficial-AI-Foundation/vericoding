 It will come in handy to define a version of nit_add that takes
 an additional argument c. Suppose I wanted to do base 2 addition
 as follows:

  1 1
  0 1

 Doing one step would give us:

  1
  1 1
  0 1

 This will allow us to do the above step nicely.

/*
 We define incrementing a nit (given its base). When you add two digits
 together, you "carry the one" if the sum is >= 10.

  1
  7
 + 3
 ---
  10

 Addition simply takes two collections of things and merges them together.
 Expressing the resulting collection in base 10 requires this strange
 notion of "carrying the one". What it means is: the sum of 7 and 3
 is one set of ten items, and nothing left over". Or if I did 6 + 7,
 that is "one set of 10, and a set of 3".

 The same notion applies in other bases. 1 + 1 in base 2 is "one set
 of 2 and 0 sets of ones".

 We can express "carrying" by using division. Division by a base
 tells us how many sets of that base we have. So 19 in base 10 is
 "1 set of 10, and 9 left over". So modding tells us what's left
 over and division tells us how much to carry (how many sets of the
 base we have).
