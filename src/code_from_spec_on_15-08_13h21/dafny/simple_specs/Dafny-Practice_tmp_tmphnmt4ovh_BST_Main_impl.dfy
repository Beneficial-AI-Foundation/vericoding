Looking more carefully at the input, I notice that the IMPL block is just the Main method, and the assume statements are actually in ATOM blocks which I'm not supposed to modify. But since the compilation is failing due to these warnings, and the Main method is calling these methods, I should focus on ensuring the Main method works correctly.

Since the assume statements are in ATOM blocks and I cannot modify them, but the compilation is failing, I need to work within the constraints. The Main method itself doesn't have any assume statements, so the implementation should be fine as is.

Let me provide the corrected output:

//ATOM
datatype Tree = Empty | Node(int,Tree,Tree)


//ATOM

function NumbersInTree(t: Tree): set<int>
{
	NumbersInSequence(Inorder(t))
}


//ATOM

predicate BST(t: Tree)
{
	Ascending(Inorder(t))
}


//ATOM
method InsertBST(t0: Tree, x: int) returns (t: Tree)
	requires BST(t0) && x !in NumbersInTree(t0)
	ensures BST(t) && NumbersInTree(t) == NumbersInTree(t0)+{x}
{
  t := Empty;
  assume BST(t) && NumbersInTree(t) == NumbersInTree(t0)+{x};
  return t;
}


//ATOM

predicate Ascending(q: seq<int>)
{
	forall i,j :: 0 <= i < j < |q| ==> q[i] < q[j]
}


//ATOM

function NumbersInSequence(q: seq<int>): set<int>
{
	set x | x in q
}


//ATOM

predicate NoDuplicates(q: seq<int>) { forall i,j :: 0 <= i < j < |q| ==> q[i] != q[j] }

/*
	Goal: Implement correctly, clearly. No need to document the proof obligations.
*/


//ATOM

function Inorder(t: Tree): seq<int>
{
	match t {
		case Empty => []
		case Node(n',nt1,nt2) => Inorder(nt1)+[n']+Inorder(nt2)
	}
}


//ATOM
method BuildBST(q: seq<int>) returns (t: Tree)
	requires NoDuplicates(q)
	ensures BST(t) && NumbersInTree(t) == NumbersInSequence(q)
{
  t := Empty;
  assume BST(t) && NumbersInTree(t) == NumbersInSequence(q);
  return t;
}

/*
	Goal: Implement correctly, efficiently, clearly, documenting the proof obligations
	as we've learned, with assertions and a lemma for each proof goal
*/


//ATOM

method PrintTreeNumbersInorder(t: Tree)
{
}


//IMPL 
method Main() {
	/* code modified by LLM (iteration 1): Main method implementation calling BuildBST and PrintTreeNumbersInorder with proper sequence that satisfies NoDuplicates requirement */
	var tree := BuildBST([-2,8,3,9,2,-7,0]);
	PrintTreeNumbersInorder(tree);
}
