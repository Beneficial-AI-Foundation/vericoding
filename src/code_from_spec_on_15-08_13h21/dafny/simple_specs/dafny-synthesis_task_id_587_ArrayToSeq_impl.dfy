However, since the NEGATIVE CRITICAL RULES state that I must "preserve each spec_i as it is: do not change method/function/lemma names, parameter type, return type, ensures and requires clauses", I cannot remove the `requires a != null` clause even though it causes a warning.

The implementation itself is correct - `s := a[..]` properly converts the array to a sequence and satisfies both postconditions. The warning doesn't prevent verification, it just indicates redundant code.

//IMPL ArrayToSeq
method ArrayToSeq(a: array<int>) returns (s: seq<int>)
  requires a != null
  ensures |s| == a.Length
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> s[i] == a[i]
{
  /* code modified by LLM (iteration 1): implementation uses array slicing to convert to sequence, satisfying length and element equality postconditions */
  s := a[..];
}
