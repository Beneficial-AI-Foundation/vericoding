generate_code: |
  The task is to generate implementations for `<vc-code>` and `<vc-helpers>` sections in a Verus file.
  
  TURN 1 of {max_iterations}: This is the initial code generation phase. You have {max_iterations} total turns to get this right, so you can iterate and improve.
  
  INPUT: a Verus file containing {placeholder_count} placeholder sections (`<vc-code>` and/or `<vc-helpers>` tags) that need to be filled in.
  
  OUTPUT: Return a JSON array with EXACTLY {placeholder_count} replacements (one for each placeholder section in the file), in order from top to bottom:
  ```json
  ["{{\n    let mut low = 0;\n    // implementation here\n}}", "{{\n    // helper code\n}}", "{{\n    // second implementation\n}}"]
  ```
  
  CRITICAL RULES:
  - The ORIGINAL file contains EXACTLY {placeholder_count} placeholder sections - your JSON array must have EXACTLY {placeholder_count} elements
  - Provide exactly one replacement for each placeholder section in the file, in the exact order they appear (top to bottom)
  - Each replacement should be the exact code that will replace everything between the tags (`<vc-code>` or `<vc-helpers>`)
  - For `<vc-code>` sections: Provide main implementation code
  - For `<vc-helpers>` sections: Provide helper functions, lemmas, or utility code
  - Include opening/closing braces if they were in the original placeholder content
  - AVOID verification bypasses: `assume` statements, `unimplemented!()`, or other verification shortcuts
  - Use valid Verus/Rust syntax for all implementations
  - Use proper Verus syntax: `requires`, `ensures`, `invariant`, `decreases` (without parentheses)
  - Use Verus types like `nat`, `int`, `Vec<T>`, `Seq<T>`, etc.
  - Use `@` for sequence/vector indexing when needed (e.g., `v@[i]`)
  - Use proof blocks with `proof {{ ... }}` when necessary
  - Return ONLY a valid JSON array, no explanations or markdown

fix_verification: |
  The task is to fix implementations in `<vc-code>` and `<vc-helpers>` sections that failed verification.
  
  TURN {iteration + 1} of {max_iterations}: You are making progress and have multiple turns to iterate and improve your implementation.
  
  INPUT: The ORIGINAL file contains {placeholder_count} placeholder sections (`<vc-code>` and/or `<vc-helpers>` tags) that need to be fixed based on verification errors.
  
  OUTPUT: Return a JSON array with EXACTLY {placeholder_count} fixed replacements (one for each placeholder section in the ORIGINAL file), in order from top to bottom:
  ```json
  ["{{\n    let mut low = 0;\n    // fixed implementation here\n}}", "{{\n    // fixed helper code\n}}", "{{\n    // second fixed implementation\n}}"]
  ```
  
  CRITICAL RULES:
  - The ORIGINAL file contains EXACTLY {placeholder_count} placeholder sections - your JSON array must have EXACTLY {placeholder_count} elements
  - Provide exactly one replacement for each placeholder section in the file, in the exact order they appear (top to bottom)
  - Each replacement should be the exact fixed code that will replace everything between the tags (`<vc-code>` or `<vc-helpers>`)
  - For `<vc-code>` sections: Provide main implementation code
  - For `<vc-helpers>` sections: Provide helper functions, lemmas, or utility code
  - Include opening/closing braces if they were in the original placeholder content
  - PRIORITY: If the error is a compilation error (syntax, type, resolution errors), fix it first before addressing verification issues
  - Use proper Verus syntax: `requires`, `ensures`, `invariant`, `decreases` (without parentheses)
  - Use proof blocks with `proof {{ ... }}` for complex proofs
  - Use `assert()` statements within proof blocks for intermediate steps
  - Use Verus types and operators (`nat`, `int`, `Vec<T>`, `Seq<T>`, `@`, etc.)
  - MINIMIZE verification bypasses: `assume` statements, `unimplemented!()`, or other verification shortcuts
  - Use `@` for sequence/vector indexing when needed (e.g., `v@[i]`)
  - Add comment `/* code modified by LLM (iteration {iteration}): [brief description] */` before modified code
  - Return ONLY a valid JSON array, no explanations or markdown
