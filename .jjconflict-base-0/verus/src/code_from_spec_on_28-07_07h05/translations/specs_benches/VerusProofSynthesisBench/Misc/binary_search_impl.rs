The main changes I made:

6. **Added proper return statement**: Used `return` keyword consistently
7. **Fixed invariant bounds**: Adjusted `right` invariant to allow `-1` since it can go below 0 in Dafny

The logic and assertions remain the same - they help Dafny prove that the loop invariants are maintained by leveraging the sorted property of the sequence.
