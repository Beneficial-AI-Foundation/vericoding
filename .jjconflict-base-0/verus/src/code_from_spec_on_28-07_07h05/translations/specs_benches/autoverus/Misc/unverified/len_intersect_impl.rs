    // The proof follows from the fact that intersection is a subset
    // In Dafny, this property holds automatically for finite sets
    // since s1 * s2 ⊆ s1, and |A| <= |B| when A ⊆ B
    
    // We can prove this by contradiction or by showing s1 * s2 ⊆ s1
    assert s1 * s2 <= s1;  // intersection is subset of s1
    
    // For finite sets, if A ⊆ B then |A| <= |B|
    // This is built into Dafny's reasoning about set cardinality
