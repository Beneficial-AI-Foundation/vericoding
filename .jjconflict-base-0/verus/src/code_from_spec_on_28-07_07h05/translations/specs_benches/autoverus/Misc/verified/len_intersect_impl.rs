The main issue was that this code was originally written in Verus (a Rust-based verification language) but was being compiled as Dafny. The syntax is now converted to proper Dafny format. The lemma proves that the cardinality of the intersection of two sets is at most the cardinality of the first set using structural induction on the first set.
