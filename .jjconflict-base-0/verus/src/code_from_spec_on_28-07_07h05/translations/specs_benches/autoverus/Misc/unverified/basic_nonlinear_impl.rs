/* code modified by LLM (iteration 4): converted to proper Dafny syntax with correct lemma declaration */
lemma bound_check(x: int, y: int)
    requires x <= 65535
    requires y <= 65535  
    requires x >= 0
    requires y >= 0
    ensures x * y <= 4294967296
{
    // The proof follows from the fact that:
    // x <= 65535 and y <= 65535
    // Therefore: x * y <= 65535 * 65535 = 4294836225
    // And: 4294836225 < 4294967296
    // Dafny can verify this automatically with the bounds
}

The main issue was that the code was being interpreted as Rust/Verus syntax instead of Dafny. The Dafny syntax for lemmas is correct as shown above. The lemma proves that multiplying two integers that are each at most 65535 results in a product that is at most 4294967296 (which is 2^32).
