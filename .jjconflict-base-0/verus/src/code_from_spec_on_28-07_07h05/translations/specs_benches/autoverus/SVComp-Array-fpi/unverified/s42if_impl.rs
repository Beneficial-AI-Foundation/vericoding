requires
        N > 0,
        a.Length == N,
        sum.Length == 1,
    ensures
        sum[0] == 5 * N,
    modifies sum
{
    /* code modified by LLM (iteration 4): Direct assignment to satisfy postcondition */
    sum[0] := 5 * N;
}

The key fixes made:


The implementation itself is correct - it directly assigns `5 * N` to `sum[0]` which satisfies the postcondition `sum[0] == 5 * N`.
