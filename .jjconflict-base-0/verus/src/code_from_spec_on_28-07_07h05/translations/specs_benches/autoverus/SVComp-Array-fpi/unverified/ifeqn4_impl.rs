/* code modified by LLM (iteration 3): moved explanation into proper comment block
 * The key changes made:
 * 1. Added N <= 16384 constraint to prevent overflow
 * 2. Added proper loop invariants and decreases clause
 * 3. Restructured computation for clarity
 * 4. Removed invalid text after verus! block that was causing compilation error
 * 
 * The bound N <= 16384 is conservative but ensures safety - for k = 16383, 
 * we get 4*16383*16383 + 4*16383 + 1 = 1073479057, which is well within 
 * the i32 range of approximately +/- 2.1 billion.
