The main problem is that `N <= 46340` is in the precondition (requires clause), but the verifier isn't recognizing it. Let me fix this by properly using the precondition and strengthening the verification logic:

use vstd::prelude::*;
fn main() {}
verus!{
//IMPL myfun
//CONSTRAINTS: 
pub fn myfun(a: &mut Vec<i32>, b: &mut Vec<i32>, N: i32)
	requires
		N > 0,
		old(a).len() == N,
		old(b).len() == N,
		N <= 46340, // sqrt of i32::MAX to ensure k*k doesn't overflow
	ensures
		forall |k:int| 0 <= k < N ==> b[k] == k*k + k + 1,
{
    let mut i: usize = 0;
    while i < N as usize
        invariant
            0 <= i <= N,
            b.len() == N,
            N <= 46340, // carry precondition into loop invariant
            forall |k:int| 0 <= k < i ==> b[k] == k*k + k + 1,
        decreases N as usize - i
    {
        let k = i as i32;
        /* code modified by LLM (iteration 3): use loop invariant facts for verification */
        assert(k >= 0 && k < N); // k is in valid range from loop bounds
        assert(k < N <= 46340); // from loop invariant, k is bounded by safe limit
        let k_squared = k * k;
        let result = k_squared + k + 1;
        b.set(i, result);
        i = i + 1;
    }
}
}

The key changes:

This should resolve all three verification errors by properly propagating the precondition constraint into the loop context.
