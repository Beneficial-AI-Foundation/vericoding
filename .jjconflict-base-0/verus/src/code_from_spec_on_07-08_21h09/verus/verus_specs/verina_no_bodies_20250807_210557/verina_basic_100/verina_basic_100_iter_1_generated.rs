Let me analyze what the postcondition requires:
- `result / 3 == x` means the result divided by 3 equals the input x
- `result / 3 * 3 == result` means the result is divisible by 3

This clearly indicates that the function should return `3 * x` (triple the input).

Let me verify this satisfies the postcondition:
- If `result = 3 * x`, then `result / 3 = (3 * x) / 3 = x` ✓
- If `result = 3 * x`, then `result / 3 * 3 = x * 3 = 3 * x = result` ✓

The precondition `x <= u32::MAX / 3` ensures that `3 * x` won't overflow when converted to u32.

use vstd::prelude::*;

verus! {

spec fn triple_precond(x: int) -> bool {
    true
}

spec fn triple_postcond(x: int, result: int) -> bool {
    result / 3 == x && result / 3 * 3 == result
}

fn triple(x: u32) -> (result: u32)
    requires 
        triple_precond(x as int),
        x <= u32::MAX / 3
    ensures 
        triple_postcond(x as int, result as int)
{
    3 * x
}

} // verus!

fn main() {}
