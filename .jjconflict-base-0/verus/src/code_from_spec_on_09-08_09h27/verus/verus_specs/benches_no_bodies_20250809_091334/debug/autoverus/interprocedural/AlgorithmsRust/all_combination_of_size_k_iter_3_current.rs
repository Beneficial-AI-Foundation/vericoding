/*
This is based on the following Rust program.
https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Rust/blob/master/src/backtracking/all_combination_of_size_k.rs

This program actually does have arithmetic overflow problems.
I had to add these two pre-conditions for its key API function generate_all_combinations to make sure there is no overflow.
		0 <= n <= i32::MAX - 1,
		0 <= k <= n,

I put the original head comments next.

/*
    In this problem, we want to determine all possible combinations of k
    numbers out of 1 ... n. We use backtracking to solve this problem.
    Time complexity: O(C(n,k)) which is O(n choose k) = O((n!/(k! * (n - k)!)))

    generate_all_combinations(n=4, k=2) => [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]
