/-- numpy.ndarray.flat: A 1-D iterator over the array.

    This operation provides a flattened view of the array, allowing access
    to elements as if the array were 1-dimensional. For 1D arrays, this is
    essentially an identity operation that provides indexed access to elements.
    
    The flat iterator acts as a view into the underlying array data, preserving
    the order of elements as they appear in memory (row-major order).

/-- Specification: numpy.ndarray.flat returns a flattened view of the array.

    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for flattening)
    Postcondition: The result contains the same elements in the same order,
                   providing a 1D view of the input array
