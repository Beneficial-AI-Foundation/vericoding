/-- numpy.mod: Returns the element-wise remainder of division.

    Computes the remainder complementary to the floor_divide function.
    This is equivalent to x1 % x2 in terms of array broadcasting.
    
    The result has the same sign as the divisor x2.
    For two arguments of floating point type, the result is:
    x1 - floor(x1/x2) * x2

  sorry

/-- Specification: numpy.mod returns a vector where each element is the remainder
    of the corresponding elements from x1 and x2.

    Precondition: All elements in x2 must be non-zero
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = x1[i] % x2[i]
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. The result has the same sign as x2[i] (when x2[i] ≠ 0)
    2. The absolute value of result[i] is less than the absolute value of x2[i]
    3. x1[i] = floor(x1[i] / x2[i]) * x2[i] + result[i]
