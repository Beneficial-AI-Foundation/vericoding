/-- numpy.ediff1d: The differences between consecutive elements of an array.

    Computes the differences between consecutive elements of an array.
    For an input array [a, b, c, d], returns [b-a, c-b, d-c].
    
    The function always returns a 1D array, and if necessary, the input
    will be flattened before the differences are taken.
    
    This is equivalent to ary.flat[1:] - ary.flat[:-1] in NumPy.

/-- Specification: numpy.ediff1d returns a vector of differences between consecutive elements.

    Precondition: The input vector must have at least one element (enforced by type)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = ary[i+1] - ary[i]
    
    Key properties:
    1. The result has length n for input of length n+1
    2. Each element represents the difference between consecutive elements
    3. The result is always 1D regardless of input shape
    4. Mathematically: result[i] = ary[i+1] - ary[i] for all valid i
