/-- numpy.transpose: Reverse or permute the axes of an array.

    For 1D arrays, this is a no-op - it returns the input array unchanged.
    This reflects numpy's behavior where transposing a 1D array has no effect
    since there's only one axis.

    For higher dimensions, transpose would swap axes, but we focus on the
    1D case here as requested.

/-- Specification: numpy.transpose returns the input vector unchanged for 1D arrays.

    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for 1D transpose)
    Postcondition: The result is identical to the input vector
