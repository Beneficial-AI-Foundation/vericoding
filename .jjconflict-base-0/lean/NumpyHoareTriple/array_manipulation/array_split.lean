The only difference\nbetween these functions is that \`array_split\` allows\n\`indices_or_sections\` to be an integer that does *not* equally\ndivide the axis. For an array of length l that should be split\ninto n sections, it returns l % n sub-arrays of size l//n + 1\nand the rest of size l//n.\n\nExamples\n--------\n>>> x = np.arange(8.0)\n>>> np.array_split(x, 3)\n[array([0.,  1.,  2.]), array([3.,  4.,  5.]), array([6.,  7.])]",

/-- Split a vector into k sub-vectors.
    
    When splitting a vector of length n into k sections:
    - The first (n % k) sub-vectors have size ⌈n/k⌉ = (n + k - 1) / k
    - The remaining sub-vectors have size ⌊n/k⌋ = n / k
    
    This ensures all elements are distributed as evenly as possible,
    with larger sub-vectors appearing first.

/-- Specification: array_split distributes elements evenly with mathematical properties
    
    The specification captures:
    1. Size distribution: larger chunks come first
    2. Element preservation: all elements from the original vector appear in order
    3. No gaps or overlaps: elements are contiguously distributed
