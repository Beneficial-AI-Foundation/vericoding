/-- numpy.std: Standard deviation of array elements.

    Computes the standard deviation of all elements in the array.
    Requires a non-empty array since variance calculation needs the mean.

    The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which measures
    the spread of the data around the mean.

/-- Specification: numpy.std returns the standard deviation of all elements.

    Precondition: True (non-empty constraint is in the type)
    Postcondition: result = sqrt(variance) where variance = mean((x - mean)²)
