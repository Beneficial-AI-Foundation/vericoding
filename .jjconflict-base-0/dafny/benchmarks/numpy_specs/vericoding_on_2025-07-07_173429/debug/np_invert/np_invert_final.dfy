I notice the specification references `BitwiseNot(a[i])`, but this function is not defined in the atoms. In Dafny, I'll need to implement bitwise NOT operation. Since Dafny doesn't have a built-in bitwise NOT operator for arbitrary integers, I'll assume this refers to the standard bitwise complement operation that can be implemented as `-x - 1` (which is equivalent to `~x` in languages that support bitwise operations).

//IMPL
method Invert(a: array<int>) returns (res: array<int>)
requires a.Length >= 0
ensures res.Length == a.Length
ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> res[i] == BitwiseNot(a[i])
{
    res := new int[a.Length];
    var i := 0;
    while i < a.Length
        invariant 0 <= i <= a.Length
        invariant res.Length == a.Length
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> res[j] == BitwiseNot(a[j])
    {
        res[i] := BitwiseNot(a[i]);
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

function BitwiseNot(x: int): int
{
    -x - 1
}
