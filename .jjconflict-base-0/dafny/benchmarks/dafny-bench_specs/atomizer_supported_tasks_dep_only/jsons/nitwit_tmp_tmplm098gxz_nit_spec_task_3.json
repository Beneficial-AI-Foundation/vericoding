In\n  n's complement, you flip the bits by subtracting the current\n  nit value from the largest possible nit value. Since our base\n  is 3, our highest possible nit value is 2:\n\n  1 0 2 1 (3)\n\n  Note how the 1's don't change (2 - 1 = 1), but the \"flipping\"\n  is demonstrated in the 2 and 0. flip(2) in base 3 = 0, and flip(0)\n  in base 3 = 2.\n\n  Now let's increment our flipped word:\n\n  1 0 2 2 (3)\n\n  Now, if this is truly the n's complement of 1 2 0 1 (3), their\n  sum should be 0:\n\n    1 1 1\n    1 2 0 1\n  + 1 0 2 2\n  ---------\n  1 0 0 0 0 (3)\n\n  Now, since our word size if 4 nits, the last nit gets dropped\n  giving us 0 0 0 0!\n\n  So basically I want to write a Dafny program that does the above\n  but verified. I don't know how far I will get, but I essentially\n  want to write an increment, addition, and flip procedures such\n  that:\n\n  sum(v, increment(flip(v)) = 0, where v is a 4 nit value in\n  a given base n.\n\n*/\n\n/*\n  In this program, we deal with bases that are explicitly greater\n  than or equal to 2. Without this fact, virtually all of our\n  postconditions will not be provable. We will run into issues\n  of dividing by 0 and what not.\n*/\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_valid_base\n\n/*\n  Now we are in a position to define a nit formally. We say\n  a natural number n is a \"nit\" of some base b if 0 <= n < b.\n  0 and 1 are 2-nits (\"bits\") since 0 <= 0 < 2 and 0 <= 1 < 2.\n*/\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_nitness\n\n/*\n  We define incrementing a nit (given its base). When you add two digits\n  together, you \"carry the one\" if the sum is >= 10.\n\n   1\n    7\n  + 3\n  ---\n   10\n\n  Addition simply takes two collections of things and merges them together.\n  Expressing the resulting collection in base 10 requires this strange\n  notion of \"carrying the one\". What it means is: the sum of 7 and 3\n  is one set of ten items, and nothing left over\". Or if I did 6 + 7,\n  that is \"one set of 10, and a set of 3\".\n\n  The same notion applies in other bases. 1 + 1 in base 2 is \"one set\n  of 2 and 0 sets of ones\".\n\n  We can express \"carrying\" by using division. Division by a base\n  tells us how many sets of that base we have. So 19 in base 10 is\n  \"1 set of 10, and 9 left over\". So modding tells us what's left\n  over and division tells us how much to carry (how many sets of the\n  base we have).\n*/\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_nit_increment\n\n/*\n  Okay next we are going to define the flip operation. In binary,\n  flip(0) = 1 and flip(1) = 0. We can generalize it to any base\n  by defining it as so:\n\n  let q be the max possible value of a given base. This\n  is b - 1. Given some nit n of b, the flip(n) is q - n.\n\n  For base 2, q = b - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. flip(0) = 1 - 0 = 1,\n  and flip(1) = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\n  For base 3, q = 3 - 1 = 2. flip(0) = 2 - 0 = 2,\n  flip(1) = 2 - 1 = 1, and flip(2) = 2 - 2 = 0.\n\n  To begin with, we define a predicate is_max_nit which\n  is true if some natural q == b - 1.\n*/\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_is_max_nit\n\n/*\n  Next we define a meta-operator (on a base b) that\n  returns the max nit. To make Dafny (and our inner\n  mathmatician) happy, we need to require that b is\n  a valid base, and explicitly say max_nit(b) is\n  a nit of b, and that max_nit(b) is_max_nit(b).\n  I found these made the actual flip operation provable.\n*/\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_max_nit\n\n/*\n  Now we define the flip operation proper. For this to work,\n  we need is_max_nit and a kind of silly proof to make Dafny\n  happy.\n*/\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_nit_flip\n\n/*\n  We will now take a detour back to addition. We want to define\n  a general version of nit_increment that allows you to add any two nits\n*/\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_nit_add\n\n/*\n  It will come in handy to define a version of nit_add that takes\n  an additional argument c. Suppose I wanted to do base 2 addition\n  as follows:\n\n    1 1\n    0 1\n  +----\n\n  Doing one step would give us:\n\n    1\n    1 1\n    0 1\n  +----\n      0\n\n  This will allow us to do the above step nicely.\n*/\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_nit_add_three\n\n/*\n  Whereas in binary computers, where we've the byte,\n  we will define a general version called a \"nyte\". A \"nyte\"\n  would be a collection of eight nits. However, for\n  simplicity's sake, we deal in half-nytes. A nibble is a\n  half-byte, so in our program we will call it a bibble.\n\n  So, a bibble given some valid_base b is a collection\n  of four nits.\n*/\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_bibble\n\n/*\n  As with nits, we will define addition, increment, and flip operations.\n*/\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_bibble_add\n\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_bibble_increment\n\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_bibble_flip\n\n/*\n  The last part of the program: n's complement! It's the same as two's complement:\n  we flip all the nits and add 1.\n*/\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_n_complement\n\n//ATOM_PLACEHOLDER_Main\n\n\n\n",
