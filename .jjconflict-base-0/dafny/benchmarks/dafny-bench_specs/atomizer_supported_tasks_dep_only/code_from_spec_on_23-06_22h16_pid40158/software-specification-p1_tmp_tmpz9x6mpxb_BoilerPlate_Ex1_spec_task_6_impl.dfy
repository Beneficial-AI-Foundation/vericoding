I understand you'd like me to fix verification errors in a Dafny file, but I don't see the actual Dafny code in your message. You've provided the format specification and mentioned "Verification failed" as the error, but the actual code content appears to be missing.

Could you please provide the complete Dafny file that contains the //ATOM and //IMPL blocks? I need to see:

1. The actual Dafny code with the ATOM and IMPL blocks
2. The specific verification error messages from Dafny
3. The complete context of any failing functions/methods/lemmas

Once I have the actual code, I'll be able to:
- Identify the specific compilation or verification issues
- Fix syntax, type, or resolution errors if they exist
- Add appropriate proof annotations or modify the implementation
- Ensure the code verifies while preserving the specifications

Please paste the complete Dafny file content, and I'll provide the corrected version following all the rules you've specified.
