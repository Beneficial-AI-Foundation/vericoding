/*
WP: is a condition that, if satisfied before the execution of a program, guarantees the 
satisfaction of a specified postcondition
SP: is a condition that must hold after the execution of a program, assuming a specified 
precondition

The strongest postcondition for assert is x<=9
Analyze the code: 
The strongest postcondition for the assert statement assert x <= 9; is x <= 9. This 
postcondition asserts that the value of x should be less than or equal to 9 after the 
execution of the program. To ensure this postcondition, we need to find a weakest precondition 
(WP) that guarantees x <= 9 after executing the code.

The "assume" statement introduces a precondition.
It assumes that the square of x is less than 100. In other words, it assumes that x is 
within the range (-10, 10) since the largest possible square less than 100 is 9 * 9 = 81.
However, since we're asserting x <= 9, and we know x * x < 100, this means -10 < x < 10.
For integers, this means x can be at most 9 (since 10 * 10 = 100, which violates x * x < 100).
