/-- numpy.hstack: Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).

    For 1D arrays, hstack stacks arrays horizontally by concatenating them
    along the first axis. This is equivalent to concatenation for 1D arrays.
    
    This version handles stacking two 1D arrays. The general version would
    handle a sequence of arrays (tup parameter in NumPy).
    
    Note: For higher dimensional arrays, hstack would concatenate along the
    second axis, but this specification focuses on the 1D case.

/-- Specification: numpy.hstack concatenates 1D arrays horizontally.

    For 1D arrays, horizontal stacking means concatenating them end-to-end,
    which is the same behavior as numpy.concatenate.
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for 1D concatenation)
    
    Postcondition: 
    - The result has size n + m
    - First n elements come from array a
    - Next m elements come from array b
    - The order of elements is preserved from both input arrays
