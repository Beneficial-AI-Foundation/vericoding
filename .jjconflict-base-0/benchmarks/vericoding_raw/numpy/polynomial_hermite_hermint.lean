/-- Integrate a Hermite series.

Returns the Hermite series coefficients integrated `m` times from `lbnd`.
At each iteration the resulting series is multiplied by `scl` and an
integration constant from `k` is added. -/

/-- Specification: hermint integrates Hermite series coefficients.

The specification captures:
1. The output vector has size n + m (m additional coefficients from integration)
2. Each integration adds one coefficient to the series
3. The integration follows Hermite polynomial integration rules
4. Integration constants from k are applied at each integration step
5. Results are scaled by scl at each step

For Hermite polynomials, the integration rule is:
- ∫ H_n(x) dx = H_{n+1}(x)/(2(n+1)) + constant

Mathematical properties:
- The first coefficient of the result incorporates the integration constant to ensure
  the integral evaluates to the appropriate value at lbnd
- For coefficient c[i] representing H_i, integration contributes c[i]/(2*(i+1)) to H_{i+1}
- The scaling factor scl is applied after each integration step -/
