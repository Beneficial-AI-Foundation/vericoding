/-- Differentiate a polynomial.
    
    Returns the polynomial coefficients differentiated `m` times.
    At each iteration the result is multiplied by `scl` (scaling factor).
    The coefficients are from low to high degree, e.g., [1,2,3] represents 1 + 2*x + 3*x².
    
    This specification handles the case where m ≤ n. When m > n, the derivative
    would be the zero polynomial.

/-- Specification: polyder computes the m-th derivative of a polynomial with scaling.
    
    Mathematical properties: 
    - d/dx(c[i] * x^i) = i * c[i] * x^(i-1)
    - With scaling factor scl: d/d(scl*x)(c[i] * x^i) = scl * i * c[i] * x^(i-1)
    - Taking m derivatives of x^i gives: i * (i-1) * ... * (i-m+1) * x^(i-m)
    
    Each coefficient is multiplied by scl at each differentiation step,
    resulting in multiplication by scl^m overall.
    
    Sanity checks:
    - Taking 0 derivatives returns the original polynomial
    - The constant term (i=0) disappears after one derivative
    - Higher order terms shift down by m positions
