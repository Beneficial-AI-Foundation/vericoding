/-- numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebint: Integrate a Chebyshev series.

    Returns the Chebyshev series coefficients integrated m times from
    lbnd along axis. At each iteration the resulting series is
    multiplied by scl and an integration constant k is added.
    
    The integration transforms Chebyshev polynomials according to the
    recurrence relations for Chebyshev polynomial integrals. For a 
    single integration (m=1) of coefficients [c₀, c₁, ..., cₙ], the 
    result follows the Chebyshev integration formula.
    
    Parameters:
    - c: Vector of Chebyshev series coefficients (low to high degree)
    - m: Order of integration (must be positive)
    - k: Integration constants (defaults to zeros)
    - lbnd: Lower bound of the integral (default: 0)
    - scl: Scaling factor applied after each integration (default: 1)

/-- Specification: chebint integrates Chebyshev series coefficients m times.

    The function performs m successive integrations of the Chebyshev series,
    where each integration:
    1. Multiplies the current coefficients by scl
    2. Applies the Chebyshev integration recurrence relations
    3. Adjusts the constant term to satisfy the boundary condition at lbnd
    4. Adds the corresponding integration constant from k
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - The result has m more coefficients than the input (integration increases degree)
    - For m=0, returns the original coefficients unchanged
    - The integration follows Chebyshev polynomial recurrence relations:
      ∫ Tₙ(x) dx = [Tₙ₊₁(x)/(2(n+1)) - Tₙ₋₁(x)/(2(n-1))] for n ≥ 2
      ∫ T₁(x) dx = T₂(x)/4
      ∫ T₀(x) dx = T₁(x)
    - The constant term is adjusted so the integral equals k[i] at x=lbnd
    
    Sanity checks:
    - The output vector has exactly n + m coefficients
    - When m = 0, the function should return the input unchanged
    - Integration constants k affect only the constant term of each integration
    - The scaling factor scl is applied before adding integration constants
