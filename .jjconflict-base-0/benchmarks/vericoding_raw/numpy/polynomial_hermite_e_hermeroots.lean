/-- Compute the roots of a HermiteE series.
    Given HermiteE series coefficients c[0], c[1], ..., c[n-1], returns the roots of
    p(x) = c[0]*He_0(x) + c[1]*He_1(x) + ... + c[n-1]*He_{n-1}(x)
    where He_i(x) are the "probabilists'" or "normalized" Hermite polynomials -/

/-- Specification: hermeroots returns the roots of the HermiteE series defined by coefficients.
    For a HermiteE series with n coefficients, there are at most n-1 roots.
    Each root r satisfies: p(r) = 0 where p(x) = Σ c[i] * He_i(x)
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. The polynomial p(x) = Σ c[i] * He_i(x) where He_i are HermiteE basis polynomials
    2. He_i(x) are the "probabilists'" Hermite polynomials related to the standard normal distribution
    3. The roots are found via eigenvalues of the companion matrix
    4. For degree n polynomial, there are exactly n-1 roots (counting multiplicity)
    5. The leading coefficient must be non-zero for a well-defined polynomial -/
