/-- Structure representing a broadcast object for two vectors.
    
    A broadcast object encapsulates the result of broadcasting two vectors
    against each other. It produces pairs of elements following NumPy's
    broadcasting rules.

/-- numpy.broadcast: Produce an object that mimics broadcasting between two vectors.
    
    This simplified version handles broadcasting between a column vector (m × 1)
    and a row vector (1 × n), producing an object that represents the m × n
    broadcast result.
    
    The broadcast object allows iteration over all element pairs that would
    result from the broadcasting operation.

/-- Specification: broadcast creates an object that correctly pairs elements
    according to NumPy broadcasting rules.
    
    For a column vector x of shape (m, 1) and row vector y of shape (1, n),
    the broadcast object has shape (m, n) and element (i, j) is the pair (x[i], y[j]).
    
    Preconditions: 
    - m > 0 (x is non-empty)
    - n > 0 (y is non-empty)
    
    Postconditions:
    - The resulting shape is (m, n)
    - Element at position (i, j) is the pair (x[i], y[j])
