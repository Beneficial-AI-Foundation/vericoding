/-- numpy.remainder: Returns the element-wise remainder of division.

    Computes the remainder complementary to the floor_divide function.
    This is equivalent to x1 % x2 in terms of array broadcasting.
    
    The result has the same sign as the divisor x2.
    For floating point inputs, the result is mathematically defined as:
    x1 - floor(x1/x2) * x2
    
    From NumPy documentation:
    - Parameters: x1, x2 (array_like) - The dividend and divisor arrays
    - Returns: remainder (ndarray) - The element-wise remainder of x1 divided by x2
    - This is a universal function (ufunc) implemented in C
    - Uses optimized C loops for different data types

/-- Specification: numpy.remainder returns a vector where each element is the remainder
    of the corresponding elements from x1 and x2.

    Mathematical Properties:
    1. Element-wise correctness: result[i] = x1[i] % x2[i]
    2. Complementary to floor division: x1[i] = floor(x1[i]/x2[i]) * x2[i] + result[i]
    3. Sign follows divisor: result[i] has the same sign as x2[i] (when x2[i] ≠ 0)
    4. Magnitude bound: |result[i]| < |x2[i]| (when x2[i] ≠ 0)
    5. Mathematical definition: result[i] = x1[i] - floor(x1[i]/x2[i]) * x2[i]
    6. Preserves vector length: result.size = x1.size = x2.size
    7. Handles IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic

    Precondition: All elements in x2 must be non-zero
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] satisfies the remainder properties
