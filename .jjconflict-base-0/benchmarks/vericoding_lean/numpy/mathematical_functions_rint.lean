/-- numpy.rint: Round elements of the array to the nearest integer.

    Rounds each element in the input array to the nearest integer using
    IEEE 754 rounding rules (round half to even). The result is returned
    as a floating-point array of the same shape as the input.

    This function uses the C math library's rint function which rounds
    to the nearest integer, with ties (halves) rounded to the nearest even number.

    Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the rounded values.

/-- Specification: numpy.rint returns a vector where each element is
    rounded to the nearest integer using IEEE 754 rounding rules.

    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for rint)
    Postcondition: For all indices i:
      - result[i] is the nearest integer to x[i]
      - for ties (half-integers), result[i] is the nearest even integer
      - result[i] is a floating-point representation of the integer
      - |result[i] - x[i]| ≤ 0.5 for all i
      - if x[i] is already an integer, result[i] = x[i]
