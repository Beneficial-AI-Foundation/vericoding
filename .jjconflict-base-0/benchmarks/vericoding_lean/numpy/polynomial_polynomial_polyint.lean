/-- Integrate a polynomial.
    
    Returns the polynomial coefficients integrated m times from lbnd.
    At each iteration the resulting series is multiplied by scl and 
    an integration constant k is added. The scaling factor is for use 
    in a linear change of variable.
    
    The input coefficients are ordered from low to high degree.
    For example, [1, 2, 3] represents 1 + 2*x + 3*x².

/-- Specification: polyint integrates polynomial coefficients m times.
    
    The integration process:
    1. For each integration step i (from 0 to m-1):
       - Multiply all coefficients by scl
       - Integrate: coefficient at degree j becomes coefficient/(j+1) at degree j+1
       - Add integration constant k[i] adjusted for lower bound lbnd
    2. Result has m more coefficients than input (degree increases by m)
    
    Properties:
    - Integration increases polynomial degree by m
    - Each integration step preserves the polynomial structure
    - The derivative of the result (m times) gives back the original scaled by scl^m
    - Integration constants k determine the value of antiderivatives at lbnd
