/-- Multi-dot product: compute the dot product of multiple matrices in a single function call
    with optimal parenthesization. This function performs a chain of matrix multiplications
    A₁ × A₂ × ... × Aₙ where the parenthesization is chosen to minimize computational cost.
    
    For three matrices A, B, C, this computes A × B × C with the optimal evaluation order.
    The result is independent of parenthesization due to associativity of matrix multiplication. -/

/-- Specification: Multi-dot performs a chain of matrix multiplications with optimal parenthesization.
    
    Mathematical properties:
    1. Associativity: (A × B) × C = A × (B × C) - the result is independent of parenthesization
    2. Dimension compatibility: A is n₁×n₂, B is n₂×n₃, C is n₃×n₄, result is n₁×n₄
    3. Element-wise computation: result[i][j] equals the triple sum over intermediate indices
    4. Optimal evaluation order: the implementation chooses the parenthesization that minimizes 
       the total number of scalar multiplications needed
    5. Correctness: the result equals the sequential application of matrix multiplications
    6. Non-empty constraint: at least two matrices are required (enforced by signature)
    
    This specification captures the essential mathematical behavior while abstracting away 
    the optimization details. The key insight is that matrix multiplication is associative,
    so different parenthesizations yield the same mathematical result. -/
