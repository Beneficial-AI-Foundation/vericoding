/-- numpy.sinc: Return the normalized sinc function, element-wise.

    The sinc function is defined as:
    - sin(π*x)/(π*x) for x ≠ 0
    - 1 for x = 0

    This is the normalized sinc function, which is used in signal processing and
    Fourier analysis. The function is continuous everywhere and has its maximum
    value of 1 at x = 0.

    Returns a vector of the same shape as the input, containing the sinc value
    of each element.

/-- Specification: numpy.sinc returns a vector where each element is the
    normalized sinc function of the corresponding element in x.

    The specification captures key mathematical properties:
    1. Element-wise computation: result[i] = sinc(x[i])
    2. Definition: sinc(x) = sin(π*x)/(π*x) for x ≠ 0, and 1 for x = 0
    3. Continuity: sinc(0) = 1 (limit as x approaches 0)
    4. Symmetry: sinc(-x) = sinc(x) (even function)
    5. Zeros: sinc(x) = 0 for x = k where k is any non-zero integer
    6. Boundedness: |sinc(x)| ≤ 1 for all x
    7. Maximum value: sinc(0) = 1 is the global maximum

    The specification is formalized to be mathematically precise while 
    remaining implementable with Float types.
