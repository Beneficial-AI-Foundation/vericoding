/-- numpy.log1p: Return the natural logarithm of one plus the input array, element-wise.
    
    Calculates log(1 + x). This function provides greater precision than log(1 + x) 
    for small values of x near zero, where the naive computation would suffer from 
    floating-point precision loss.
    
    Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing log(1 + x) for each element.
    
    Note: The domain is x > -1 (since log(1 + x) requires 1 + x > 0).
    For x = -1, the result is -∞ (negative infinity).
    For x < -1, the result is NaN (not a number).

/-- Specification: log1p returns a vector where each element is the natural
    logarithm of one plus the corresponding element in x.
    
    Precondition: All elements must be greater than -1 (x[i] > -1)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = log(1 + x[i])
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - log1p(0) = log(1) = 0
    - log1p(e - 1) = 1
    - log1p provides better precision than log(1 + x) for small x
    - log1p is strictly increasing on (-1, ∞)
    - log1p(x) = log(1 + x) for all valid x
    - For small x, log1p(x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ...
