/-- numpy.flatiter: Flat iterator object to iterate over arrays.
    
    A flatiter iterator provides a flattened view of an array for iteration purposes.
    It allows accessing elements of a multi-dimensional array as if it were 1-dimensional,
    following row-major (C-style) order where the last index varies fastest.
    
    The iterator supports indexing and provides sequential access to all elements
    in the array following the memory layout order.

/-- Specification: numpy.flatiter creates a flat iterator over the array.
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for creating a flat iterator)
    Postcondition: The result preserves all elements in row-major order,
                   providing sequential access to the flattened array elements
