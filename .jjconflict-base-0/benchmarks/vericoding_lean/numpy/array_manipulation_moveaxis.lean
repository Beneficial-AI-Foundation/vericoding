/-- Move axes in a 1D vector (simplified version).
    For 1D arrays, moveaxis with source=0 and destination=0 returns the array unchanged.
    This captures the core mathematical property that moving an axis to itself is identity. -/

/-- Specification: moveaxis preserves all elements and their values.
    For 1D arrays, moveaxis is always the identity function since there's only one axis.
    This specification captures several mathematical properties:
    1. Element preservation: all values remain unchanged
    2. Size preservation: the shape is maintained
    3. Identity property: moving axis 0 to position 0 is identity
    4. Order preservation: for 1D arrays, element order is maintained -/
