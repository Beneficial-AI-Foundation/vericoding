/*(a). Do you have an explanation for this behaviour?
    Answer: 
    The method strange() appears to prove 1==2, but this is actually due to an impossible
    postcondition. The method has an ensures clause that cannot be satisfied (1==2 is always false).
    In Dafny, if a method has an impossible postcondition, it means the method should never
    terminate normally - it represents an inconsistent specification. However, if the method
    body doesn't actually create a real contradiction or infinite loop, Dafny will flag this
    as a verification error because the implementation cannot satisfy the impossible postcondition.
    
    The original idea might have been to create a contradiction by calling method q with
    parameters that make its postcondition unsatisfiable, but upon closer analysis, 
    the postcondition of q is actually satisfiable for most reasonable inputs that satisfy
    its precondition y - x > 2.

/*
Problem 3 explanation:
The code with assume x * x < 100; assert x <= 9; verifies because:

Using weakest precondition analysis:
- We want to prove x <= 9 after the assume statement
- The assume statement gives us x * x < 100
- For integers, if x * x < 100, then |x| < 10, which means -9 <= x <= 9
- Since x can be negative, we have x <= 9 is always true
- The weakest precondition is satisfied by the assume statement

However, note that if the assertion were x >= -9, that would also be valid,
and if it were assert x < 10, that would also be valid.
