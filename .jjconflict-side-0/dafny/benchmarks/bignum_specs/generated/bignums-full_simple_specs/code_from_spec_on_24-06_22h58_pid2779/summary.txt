=== DEBUG FEATURES ===
Debug mode: Enabled
- Debug files saved in: debug/ subdirectory
- Each file has its own debug subdirectory: debug/filename/
- Saves original specification as *_iter_0_original.dfy
- Saves initial generated code as *_iter_1_generated.dfy
- Saves current working version for each iteration as *_iter_N_current.dfy
- Final implementation saved as *_impl.dfy in main directory
- Full debugging: all intermediate files are saved in debug/filename/

- Debug mode control: Enabled
- Configurable file output based on debug setting
- Iteration tracking: nr_iter field in CSV shows final iteration
