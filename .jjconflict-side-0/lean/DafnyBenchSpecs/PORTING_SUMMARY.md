# Dafny to Lean 4 Porting Summary

This document summarizes the 10 Dafny specifications that were ported to Lean 4.

## Ported Files

1. **PrefixSum.lean** (from CVS-Projto1_tmp_tmpb1o0bu8z_proj1_proj1_spec.dfy)
   - Implements array sum calculation with prefix sum optimization
   - Includes custom list type conversion from arrays
   - Key functions: `sum`, `query`, `queryFast`, `from_array`

2. **SearchSort.lean** (from CVS-Projto1_tmp_tmpb1o0bu8z_searchSort_spec.dfy)
   - Contains array filling and substring search specifications
   - Key functions: `fillK`, `containsSubString`
   - Note: Original specifications were incomplete

3. **ContainerRanks.lean** (from dafl_tmp_tmp_r3_8w3y_dafny_examples_dafny0_ContainerRanks_spec.dfy)
   - Demonstrates well-foundedness properties of recursive datatypes
   - Proves that containers cannot contain themselves
   - Simplified multisets/sets to lists due to Lean type constraints

4. **SeqFromArray.lean** (from dafl_tmp_tmp_r3_8w3y_dafny_examples_dafny0_SeqFromArray_spec.dfy)
   - Array manipulation methods with various size constraints
   - Key functions: `H`, `K`, `L`, `M'`
   - Note: Original specifications lack postconditions

5. **BinarySearch2.lean** (from dafl_tmp_tmp_r3_8w3y_dafny_examples_uiowa_binary-search_spec.dfy)
   - Binary search implementation with sorted array predicate
   - Includes discussion of different sorted definitions
   - Key function: `binSearch`

6. **Fibonacci.lean** (from dafl_tmp_tmp_r3_8w3y_dafny_examples_uiowa_fibonacci_spec.dfy)
   - Classical Fibonacci sequence definition and computation
   - Key function: `computeFib` (efficient implementation)

7. **Find2.lean** (from dafl_tmp_tmp_r3_8w3y_dafny_examples_uiowa_find_spec.dfy)
   - Find first occurrence of element in array
   - Returns index or -1 if not found
   - Key function: `find`

8. **TwoSum2.lean** (from dafleet_tmp_tmpa2e4kb9v_0001-0050_0001-two-sum_spec.dfy)
   - LeetCode Two Sum problem implementation
   - Find two indices that sum to target
   - Uses List instead of Array for simplicity

9. **LongestPalindrome.lean** (from dafleet_tmp_tmpa2e4kb9v_0001-0050_0005-longest-palindromic-substring_spec.dfy)
   - Find longest palindromic substring
   - Includes helper functions for expanding from center
   - Complex termination proof for recursive palindrome check

10. **TwoSum3.lean** (from dafny_examples_tmp_tmp8qotd4ez_leetcode_0001-two-sum_spec.dfy)
    - Alternative Two Sum implementation with detailed search order
    - Uses HashMap for efficient lookup
    - More detailed postconditions about which pair is found

## Porting Notes

- All implementations are left as `sorry` to focus on specifications
- Used Hoare triple syntax: `⦃⌜precondition⌝⦄ program ⦃⇓result => ⌜postcondition⌝⦄`
- Some Dafny features were adapted:
  - Multisets → Lists (due to Lean standard library)
  - Sequences → Lists/Arrays as appropriate
  - Some termination proofs required manual intervention
- Added appropriate type class constraints (DecidableEq, Inhabited) where needed
- Some original specifications were incomplete and noted as such
