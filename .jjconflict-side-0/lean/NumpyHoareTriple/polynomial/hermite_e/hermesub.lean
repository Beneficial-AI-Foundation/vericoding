/-- Specification: hermesub performs component-wise subtraction of Hermite series coefficients.
    The result has length equal to the maximum of the input lengths, with shorter arrays
    implicitly padded with zeros. This captures the mathematical property that polynomial 
    subtraction is component-wise and preserves the polynomial structure. -/
