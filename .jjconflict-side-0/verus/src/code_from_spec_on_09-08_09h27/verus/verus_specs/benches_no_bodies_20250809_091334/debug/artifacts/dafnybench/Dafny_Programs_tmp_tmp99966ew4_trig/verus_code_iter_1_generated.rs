The precondition `forall|x: int| P(x) ==> P(x) && Q(x)` can be instantiated with `x = 0` to get `P(0) ==> P(0) && Q(0)`. However, this still requires me to know `P(0)`.

Wait, let me reconsider. The issue is that I need to prove `Q(0)` but I don't have direct information about `P(0)`. However, since these are uninterpreted functions and the precondition is given, I should be able to use proof techniques.

Actually, looking more carefully at the logic: if I can establish `P(0)`, then by the precondition I get `P(0) && Q(0)`, which gives me `Q(0)`. But I need to find a way to establish `P(0)` or find another approach.

Let me try a different approach. Since I cannot directly establish `P(0)` from the precondition, and the postcondition requires `Q(0)`, there must be a way to prove this. Let me try using an assert and see if Verus can prove it:

use vstd::prelude::*;

verus! {
    uninterp spec fn P(x: int) -> bool;

    uninterp spec fn Q(x: int) -> bool;

    fn test()
        requires forall|x: int| #[trigger] P(x) ==> P(x) && Q(x),
        ensures Q(0)
    {
        proof {
            if P(0) {
                assert(P(0) ==> P(0) && Q(0));
                assert(Q(0));
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {}
