The key changes I made:
- Removed all text outside the code block that was causing compilation errors
- Removed invalid backtick characters that were causing parsing issues
- Updated iteration numbers in comments to reflect this is iteration 3
- Kept the core implementation logic intact with proper invariants and decreases clause
