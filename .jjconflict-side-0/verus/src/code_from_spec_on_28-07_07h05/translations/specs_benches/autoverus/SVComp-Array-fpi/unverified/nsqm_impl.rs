/* code modified by LLM (iteration 3): moved all explanatory text inside the verus block as comments
 * The key changes made:
 * - Added bounds to prevent overflow
 * - Added invariants to ensure conversion safety
 * - Added decreases clause to prove loop termination
 * - Added assertions to prevent arithmetic overflow
 * - Moved all explanatory text inside proper comment blocks within the verus section
 * These changes address the arithmetic overflow errors while maintaining the original specification's contract.
 * The main issue was that there were unquoted text lines at the end of the file outside the
 * verus block, which Rust was trying to parse as code. All explanatory comments are now
 * inside proper comment blocks within the verus section to fix the compilation errors.
