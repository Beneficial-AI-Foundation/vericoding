Looking at the error, the issue is that the provided input is not valid Dafny code but rather explanatory text. The compilation errors indicate that the file contains natural language text instead of Dafny syntax.

Since no valid Dafny code with ATOM or IMPL blocks is provided in the input, I'll output a minimal valid Dafny file:

```dafny
// No ATOM or IMPL blocks found in the input
// Please provide valid Dafny code with proper //ATOM and //IMPL markers
```

To properly process your request, I need the actual Dafny file containing:
- Code blocks marked with `//ATOM` containing functions, methods, predicates, or lemmas
- Code blocks marked with `//IMPL [spec name]` containing implementations that need verification fixes
- Valid Dafny syntax throughout the file

Please provide the actual Dafny code you'd like me to verify and fix.
