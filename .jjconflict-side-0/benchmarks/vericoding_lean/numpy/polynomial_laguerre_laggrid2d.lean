/-- numpy.polynomial.laguerre.laggrid2d: Evaluate a 2-D Laguerre series on the Cartesian product of x and y.

    This function computes the values p(a,b) = ∑_{i,j} c_{i,j} * L_i(a) * L_j(b)
    where the points (a,b) consist of all pairs formed by taking a from x and b from y.
    The resulting points form a grid with x in the first dimension and y in the second.

    The coefficients c represent a 2D matrix where c[i,j] is the coefficient for
    the term of multi-degree i,j in the Laguerre series expansion.

/-- Specification: laggrid2d evaluates a 2D Laguerre series on the Cartesian product of x and y.

    The function computes p(a,b) = ∑_{i,j} c_{i,j} * L_i(a) * L_j(b) for each point (a,b)
    in the Cartesian product of x and y.

    Precondition: The coefficient matrix c must be non-empty (rows > 0 and cols > 0)
    Postcondition: The result is a grid where result[i][j] represents the evaluation
    of the Laguerre series at point (x[i], y[j]).

    Mathematical properties:
    1. The result has shape (nx, ny) - same as the Cartesian product of x and y
    2. Each element result[i][j] is the sum over all coefficient terms c[k][l] * L_k(x[i]) * L_l(y[j])
    3. For constant coefficients (c[0][0] only), the result should be constant
    4. The function is linear in the coefficients
