/-- numpy.i0: Modified Bessel function of the first kind, order 0.

    Computes the Modified Bessel function of the first kind, order 0, element-wise.
    This is a special function that arises in many mathematical contexts including
    solutions to differential equations and probability theory.

    The function is defined by the infinite series:
    i0(x) = sum((x/2)^(2k) / (k!)^2, k=0..inf)

    Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the i0 values of each element.

/-- Specification: numpy.i0 returns a vector where each element is the Modified
    Bessel function of the first kind, order 0, of the corresponding element in x.

    Mathematical properties:
    1. i0(0) = 1 (by definition, the series starts with 1)
    2. i0(x) > 0 for all real x (positive function)
    3. i0(x) = i0(-x) (even function)
    4. i0(x) is monotonically increasing for x ≥ 0
    5. For large x, i0(x) ≈ exp(|x|) / sqrt(2π|x|) (asymptotic behavior)

    Precondition: True (no special preconditions for i0)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = i0(x[i]) with the mathematical properties above
