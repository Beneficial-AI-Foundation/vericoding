/-- numpy.polynomial.hermite_e.hermeweight: Weight function of the Hermite_e polynomials.

    The weight function is exp(-x²/2) and the interval of integration is [-∞, ∞].
    The HermiteE polynomials are orthogonal, but not normalized, with respect to this weight function.
    
    For each input value x, computes the weight function w(x) = exp(-x²/2).
    This is a fundamental weight function used in probabilistic HermiteE polynomial theory.
    
    Returns an array of the same shape as x, containing the weight function values.

/-- Specification: hermeweight returns a vector where each element is the HermiteE weight function
    applied to the corresponding element in x.

    The weight function is mathematically defined as w(x) = exp(-x²/2).
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions - weight function is defined for all real numbers)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = exp(-x[i]²/2)
    
    Mathematical properties:
    - Weight function is always positive: w(x) > 0 for all x
    - Weight function is symmetric: w(x) = w(-x)
    - Weight function achieves maximum at x = 0: w(0) = 1
    - Weight function approaches 0 as |x| → ∞
