/-- numpy.logaddexp: Logarithm of the sum of exponentiations of the inputs.

    Calculates log(exp(x1) + exp(x2)) element-wise. This function is useful 
    in statistics where the calculated probabilities of events may be so small 
    as to exceed the range of normal floating point numbers.

    The logaddexp function provides a numerically stable way to compute
    log(exp(x1) + exp(x2)) without intermediate overflow or underflow.

    Mathematical properties:
    - logaddexp(x, x) = x + log(2)
    - logaddexp(x, -∞) = x
    - logaddexp(-∞, x) = x
    - logaddexp is symmetric: logaddexp(x, y) = logaddexp(y, x)
    - logaddexp is associative in the sense that it satisfies the log-sum-exp properties
    - logaddexp(x, y) ≥ max(x, y) for all x, y

    From NumPy documentation:
    - Parameters: x1, x2 (array_like) - Input arrays
    - Returns: ndarray - The element-wise logaddexp of the inputs

/-- Specification: numpy.logaddexp returns a vector where each element is the
    logarithm of the sum of exponentiations of the corresponding elements.

    Mathematical Properties:
    1. Element-wise correctness: result[i] = log(exp(x1[i]) + exp(x2[i]))
    2. Commutativity: logaddexp(x1, x2) = logaddexp(x2, x1)
    3. Numerical stability: avoids intermediate overflow/underflow
    4. Bounds: logaddexp(x, y) ≥ max(x, y) for all x, y
    5. Special cases: 
       - logaddexp(x, x) = x + log(2)
       - logaddexp(x, -∞) = x (when x is finite)
       - logaddexp(-∞, x) = x (when x is finite)
    6. Monotonicity: logaddexp is monotonically increasing in both arguments
    7. Associativity property: satisfies log-sum-exp algebraic relations

    Precondition: True (logaddexp is defined for all real numbers)
    Postcondition: For all indices i, result[i] = log(exp(x1[i]) + exp(x2[i]))
                   and result[i] ≥ max(x1[i], x2[i])
