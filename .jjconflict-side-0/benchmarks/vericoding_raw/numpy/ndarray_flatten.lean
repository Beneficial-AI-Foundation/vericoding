/-- numpy.ndarray.flatten: Return a copy of the array collapsed into one dimension.
    
    Flattens a 2D matrix into a 1D vector using row-major (C-style) order.
    Each row is placed sequentially in the output vector.
    
    Parameters:
    - mat: 2D matrix represented as Vector of Vectors
    
    Returns:
    - 1D vector containing all elements in row-major order
    
    Example: [[1,2], [3,4]] becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]

/-- Specification: flatten returns a 1D vector containing all elements of the 2D matrix
    in row-major order.
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
    Postcondition: 
    - The result has size rows * cols
    - Each element at position (row * cols + col) equals the original element at (row, col)
    - Elements are ordered by row-major traversal (row 0 first, then row 1, etc.)
