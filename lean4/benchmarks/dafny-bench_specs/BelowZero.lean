/-- Check if a sequence of operations causes the balance to go below zero.
    
    Given a sequence of operations (deposits/withdrawals), computes the running
    balance starting from 0 and returns whether the balance ever goes negative.
    
    Specification from Dafny:
    - s[0] = 0 (initial balance)
    - s[i+1] = s[i] + operations[i] (running sum)
    - result = true iff there exists an i where s[i] < 0
-/
def belowZero (operations : List Int) : Id (Array Int × Bool) := Id.run do
  let mut balances : Array Int := #[0]
  let mut balance := 0
  let mut result := false
  
  for op in operations do
    balance := balance + op
    balances := balances.push balance
    if balance < 0 then
      result := true
  
  return (balances, result)

/-- Specification: belowZero tracks running balance and detects negative values.
    
    Precondition: True (no special preconditions)
    Postcondition: 
    - s.size = operations.length + 1
    - s[0] = 0
    - For all i < operations.length, s[i+1] = s[i] + operations[i]
    - result = true ↔ ∃ i, s[i] < 0
