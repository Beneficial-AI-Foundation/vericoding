/-- linearSearch2: Search for an element that is guaranteed to exist in the array.

    This variant of linear search has a precondition that the element exists
    in the array, so it always returns a valid index.
    
    This is useful when you know the element is present and want to avoid
    handling the "not found" case.

def linearSearch2 (a : Array Int) (e : Int) : Id Nat :=
  match a.findIdx? (· = e) with
  | some idx => pure idx
  | none => panic! "Element not found (violates precondition)"

/-- Specification: linearSearch2 returns the index of the first occurrence of e.

    Precondition: There exists an index i such that a[i] = e
    Postcondition:
    - The returned index n satisfies a[n] = e
    - All elements before index n are not equal to e
