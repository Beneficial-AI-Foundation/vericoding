# Synthesis Task: Sum of Common Divisors

This module ports the Dafny synthesis task for calculating the sum of common divisors.

The specification includes:
- A method `sumOfCommonDivisors` that computes the sum of all common divisors of a and b
- Requires both inputs to be positive
- Ensures the sum is non-negative
- Ensures the sum is at least as large as any common divisor
