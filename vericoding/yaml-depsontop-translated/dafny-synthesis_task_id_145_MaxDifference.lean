MaxDifference takes an array of integers and returns the maximum difference between any two elements.

@param a The input array of integers
@return The maximum difference between any two elements in the array

Requirements:
- The array must have length greater than 1

Ensures:
- The returned difference is greater than or equal to the difference between any two elements
-/
def MaxDifference (a : Array Int) : Int :=

/--
Specification theorem for MaxDifference stating that:
1. The array must have length > 1
2. The returned difference is greater than or equal to any difference between array elements
