    // We need to ensure N * (N + 1) doesn't overflow
    // For i32, the maximum safe N is around 46340
    // Since we cannot change the postcondition, we add an assertion
    // that the caller must ensure N is within safe bounds
    assert(N <= 46340); // Ensure no overflow will occur
    assert(N * (N + 1) <= i32::MAX); // Explicit overflow check
    
    /* code modified by LLM (iteration 4): Direct assignment with proven safety */
    sum[0] = N * (N + 1);
}
}

The key changes made:
- Removed the problematic explanatory text that was causing compilation errors
- Kept only the valid Rust/Verus code
- Updated the iteration number in the comments to reflect this fix
- Maintained the overflow prevention logic and direct assignment approach
