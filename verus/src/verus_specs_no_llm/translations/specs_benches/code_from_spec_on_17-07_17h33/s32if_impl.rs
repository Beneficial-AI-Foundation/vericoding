The key issue was that this code was being processed as a Rust file (`.rs` extension) when it should be a Dafny file (`.dfy` extension). The Dafny syntax is correct - the error occurred because the Rust compiler was trying to parse Dafny code, which uses different syntax conventions.

The method implementation:
