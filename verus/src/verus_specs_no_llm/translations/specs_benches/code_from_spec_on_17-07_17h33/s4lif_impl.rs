//IMPL myfun
/* code modified by LLM (iteration 3): Fixed method syntax and ensured proper Dafny formatting */
method myfun(a: array<int>, sum: array<int>, N: int)
    requires N > 0
    requires a.Length == N
    requires sum.Length == 1
    ensures sum[0] == 5 * N
    modifies sum
{
    sum[0] := 5 * N;
}

The implementation is straightforward since the postcondition `ensures sum[0] == 5 * N` can be satisfied by directly assigning `5 * N` to `sum[0]`. The parameter `a` is not used in this implementation, which is acceptable since the specification doesn't require any computation involving the array `a`.
