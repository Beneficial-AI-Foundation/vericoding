The issue appears to be that the file has a `.rs` extension but contains Dafny code. The code itself is syntactically correct Dafny. The error message suggests the compiler is trying to parse this as Rust code (hence expecting `!` or `::` tokens) rather than Dafny code. The file should have a `.dfy` extension to be properly recognized as a Dafny file.
