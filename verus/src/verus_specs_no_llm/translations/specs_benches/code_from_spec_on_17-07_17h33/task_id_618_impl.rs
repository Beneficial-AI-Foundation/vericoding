//IMPL element_wise_divide

/* code modified by LLM (iteration 2): Removed stray text and provided clean Dafny implementation */
method element_wise_divide(arr1: seq<int>, arr2: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    requires |arr1| == |arr2|
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |arr2| ==> arr2[i] != 0
    ensures |result| == |arr1|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == arr1[i] / arr2[i]
{
    result := [];
    var i := 0;
    
    while i < |arr1|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |arr1|
        invariant |result| == i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> result[j] == arr1[j] / arr2[j]
    {
        var quotient := arr1[i] / arr2[i];
        result := result + [quotient];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The main issues were:

The implementation itself is correct - it performs element-wise division of two sequences with proper loop invariants to verify the postconditions.
