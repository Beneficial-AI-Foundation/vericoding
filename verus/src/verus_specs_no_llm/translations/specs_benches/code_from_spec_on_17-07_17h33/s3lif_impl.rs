//IMPL myfun
//CONSTRAINTS: no assume statements
/* code modified by LLM (iteration 1): Fixed compilation errors by removing explanatory text and providing clean Dafny implementation */
method myfun(a: array<int>, sum: array<int>, N: int)
    requires N > 0
    requires a.Length == N
    requires sum.Length == 1
    ensures sum[0] == 4 * N
    modifies sum
{
    /* code modified by LLM (iteration 1): Direct implementation of postcondition */
    sum[0] := 4 * N;
}

The key fixes:
- Removed all the explanatory text that was causing compilation errors
- Kept only the valid Dafny code structure
- The implementation directly assigns `4 * N` to `sum[0]` to satisfy the postcondition
- Removed any problematic characters that were causing tokenization issues

This should compile and verify correctly in Dafny, as it directly implements the required postcondition `sum[0] == 4 * N`.
