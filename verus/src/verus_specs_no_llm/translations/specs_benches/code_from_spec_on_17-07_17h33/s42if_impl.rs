//IMPL myfun
method myfun(a: array<int>, sum: array<int>, N: int)
requires
    N > 0
    a.Length == N
    sum.Length == 1
ensures
    sum[0] == 5 * N
modifies sum
{
    /* code modified by LLM (iteration 4): Removed overflow check and used direct assignment since Dafny integers are mathematical integers */
    sum[0] := 5 * N;
}

The key changes made:

The verification should now succeed because:
- We directly assign `5 * N` to `sum[0]`
- The postcondition `sum[0] == 5 * N` is trivially satisfied
- No overflow concerns exist with Dafny's mathematical integers
