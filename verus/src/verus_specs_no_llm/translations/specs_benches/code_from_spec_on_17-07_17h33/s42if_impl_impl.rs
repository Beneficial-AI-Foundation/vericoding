//IMPL myfun
/* code modified by LLM (iteration 4): Removed invalid text and characters, kept only valid Dafny code */
method myfun(a: array<int>, sum: array<int>, N: int)
    requires N > 0
    requires a.Length == N
    requires sum.Length == 1
    requires N < 1000
    ensures sum[0] == 5 * N
    modifies sum
{
    sum[0] := 5 * N;
}

The key fixes:

The implementation directly assigns `5 * N` to `sum[0]` to satisfy the postcondition. This is correct and should verify successfully in Dafny.
