The key change is in the calculation line:
- Changed from `4 * (k as int) * (k as int) + 4 * (k as int) + 1` 
- To `4 * k * k + 4 * k + 1`

This uses `i32` arithmetic directly instead of casting to `int` (which is a ghost type in Verus). The postcondition still uses `int` types, but that's fine since postconditions are ghost/spec context.
