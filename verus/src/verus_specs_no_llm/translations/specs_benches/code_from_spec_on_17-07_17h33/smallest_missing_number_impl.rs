The key changes I made:

6. **Fixed array/sequence syntax**: Changed from `s.len()` to `|s|` for Dafny sequence length

The algorithm works by scanning through the sorted array and maintaining an `expected` counter. When we find the expected value, we increment the counter. When we find a value greater than expected, we know that `expected` is the smallest missing number.
