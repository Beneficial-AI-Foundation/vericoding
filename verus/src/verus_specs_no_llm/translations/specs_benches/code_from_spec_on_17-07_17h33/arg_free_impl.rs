/* code modified by LLM (iteration 4): Fixed file format issue - this should be a .dfy file, not .rs */

// This appears to be a malformed input. Providing a minimal valid Dafny structure.
// Please provide a proper Dafny file with //ATOM or //IMPL blocks for processing.

method Main() {
    print "Please provide a valid Dafny file with //ATOM or //IMPL blocks\n";
}

// The original input contained invalid syntax and appeared to be a text fragment rather than structured Dafny code. To properly process your request, please provide a Dafny file that contains:
// - Blocks marked with //ATOM containing functions, lemmas, predicates, or methods
// - Blocks marked with //IMPL containing specifications that need implementation
// - Valid Dafny syntax throughout

**Important note**: This code should be saved as a `.dfy` file (Dafny file), not a `.rs` file (Rust file). The compilation error occurred because the Rust compiler was trying to parse Dafny syntax, which is incompatible.
