//IMPL check_sorted

method check_sorted(arr: array<int>) returns (is_sorted: bool)
    requires arr.Length > 0
    ensures is_sorted == (forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < arr.Length ==> arr[i] <= arr[j])
{
    /* code modified by LLM (iteration 4): implemented proper Dafny logic with correct loop bounds and invariant */
    var i := 0;
    while i < arr.Length - 1
        invariant 0 <= i <= arr.Length - 1
        invariant forall k, l :: 0 <= k < l < i + 1 ==> arr[k] <= arr[l]
    {
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1] {
            is_sorted := false;
            return;
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    is_sorted := true;
}

The main issue appears to be with the file format or parser state. The method declaration syntax looks correct for Dafny, but let me ensure it's properly formatted with no hidden characters or encoding issues. The compilation error suggesting it expected `!` or `::` is unusual for this context, which might indicate a parsing state issue from previous code or file encoding problems.
