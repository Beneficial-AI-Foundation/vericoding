Looking at the error messages, I can see that the input file contains explanatory text rather than actual Dafny code with ATOM and IMPL blocks. The errors indicate that the file is being parsed as Rust code but contains invalid syntax.

Since no ATOM or IMPL blocks are present in the provided input, I'll provide a minimal valid Dafny file:

```dafny
// Minimal valid Dafny file structure
// No ATOM or IMPL blocks were found in the input to process

method Main() {
    // Empty main method to ensure valid Dafny compilation
}
```

The input provided appears to be explanatory text about combinations algorithms rather than actual Dafny code that needs verification. To properly implement the requested functionality, I would need the actual Dafny file containing:

1. Code blocks marked with `//ATOM` 
2. Code blocks marked with `//IMPL [spec name]`
3. Proper Dafny syntax with methods, functions, predicates, requires, and ensures clauses

Please provide the actual Dafny file with ATOM and IMPL blocks for proper processing and verification.
