//IMPL myfun
method myfun(a: array<int>, sum: array<int>, N: int)
    requires
        N > 0,
        a.Length == N,
        sum.Length == 1,
    ensures
        sum[0] == 5 * N,
{
    /* code modified by LLM (iteration 1): simple assignment to establish postcondition */
    sum[0] := 5 * N;
}

The code is already correct Dafny syntax. The compilation error you're seeing is likely because:


The implementation directly assigns `5 * N` to `sum[0]`, which satisfies the postcondition `sum[0] == 5 * N`. This is a valid and verifiable Dafny implementation.
