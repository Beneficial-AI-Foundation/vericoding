So `sum` represents the sum of integers from 1 to `i` (inclusive), which is indeed `i * (i + 1) / 2`. However, the issue is with the order of operations in the loop and how Verus verifies the invariant maintenance.

Let me fix this by adjusting the proof and helping Verus understand the arithmetic:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn Sum(N: int) -> (s: int)
    requires
        N >= 0
    ensures
        s == N * (N + 1) / 2
{
    let mut i: int = 0;
    let mut sum: int = 0;
    
    while i < N
        invariant
            0 <= i <= N,
            sum == i * (i + 1) / 2
    {
        let old_i = i;
        let old_sum = sum;
        
        i = i + 1;
        sum = sum + i;
        
        // Help Verus prove the invariant is maintained
        assert(old_sum == old_i * (old_i + 1) / 2);
        assert(sum == old_sum + i);
        assert(sum == old_i * (old_i + 1) / 2 + (old_i + 1));
        assert(sum == (old_i * (old_i + 1) + 2 * (old_i + 1)) / 2);
        assert(sum == (old_i + 1) * (old_i + 2) / 2);
        assert(sum == i * (i + 1) / 2);
    }
    
    sum
}

}
