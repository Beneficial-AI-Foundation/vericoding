- `requires x == -1`: The input must be -1
- `ensures 0 <= y`: The result must be non-negative
- `ensures 0 <= x ==> y == x`: If x is non-negative, then y equals x
- `ensures x < 0 ==> y == -x`: If x is negative, then y equals -x

Since the precondition requires `x == -1`, we know `x < 0`, so the third postcondition applies: `y == -x`. With `x == -1`, we get `y == -(-1) == 1`.

Here's the verified Verus implementation:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn Abs(x: int) -> (y: int)
    requires
        x == -1
    ensures
        0 <= y,
        0 <= x ==> y == x,
        x < 0 ==> y == -x
{
    -x
}

}

The implementation is simply `-x`. Given the precondition `x == -1`:
- The result is `-(-1) = 1`
- This satisfies `0 <= y` since `1 >= 0`
- Since `x == -1 < 0`, the condition `x < 0 ==> y == -x` applies and is satisfied
- The condition `0 <= x ==> y == x` is vacuously true since `x == -1` means `0 <= x` is false
