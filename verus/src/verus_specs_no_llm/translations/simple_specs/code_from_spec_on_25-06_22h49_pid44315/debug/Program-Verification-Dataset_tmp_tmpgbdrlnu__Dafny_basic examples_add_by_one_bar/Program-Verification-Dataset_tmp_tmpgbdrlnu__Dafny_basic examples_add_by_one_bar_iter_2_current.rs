fn main() {
}

fn bar(x: int, y: int) -> (r: int)
    requires
        y >= 0
    ensures
        r == x + y
{
    x + y
}

}

The main change I made is removing the explicit `return` statement and just using the expression `x + y` directly, which is more idiomatic in Rust/Verus. The function should verify correctly as:


This should compile and verify successfully in Verus.
