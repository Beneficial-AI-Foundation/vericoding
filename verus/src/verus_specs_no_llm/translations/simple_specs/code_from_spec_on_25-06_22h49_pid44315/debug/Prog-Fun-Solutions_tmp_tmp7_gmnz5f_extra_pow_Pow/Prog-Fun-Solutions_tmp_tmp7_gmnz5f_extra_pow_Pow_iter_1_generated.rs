I'll implement this using iterative exponentiation with a loop invariant to prove correctness:

// Translated from Dafny
use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn Pow(a: nat, n: nat) -> (y: nat)
    ensures
        y == pow(a, n)
{
    let mut result: nat = 1;
    let mut i: nat = 0;
    
    while i < n
        invariant
            i <= n,
            result == pow(a, i)
    {
        result = result * a;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    
    result
}

}

The implementation works as follows:


   - `i <= n` (we don't exceed the target exponent)
   - `result == pow(a, i)` (result correctly represents `a^i`)

   - Multiply `result` by `a` (so `result` becomes `a^(i+1)`)
   - Increment `i` by 1


The loop invariant is key to verification - it maintains that `result` always equals `pow(a, i)`, and when the loop exits with `i == n`, we get the desired result `pow(a, n)`.
