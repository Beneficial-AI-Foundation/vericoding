fn main() {
}

fn LateralSurfaceArea(size: int) -> (area: int)
    requires
        size > 0
    ensures
        area == 4 * size * size
{
    4 * size * size
}

}

The implementation is straightforward - I simply return the expression `4 * size * size` which directly matches the postcondition. Since Verus can automatically verify that the returned value satisfies the ensures clause when it's an exact match, this implementation will verify successfully.
