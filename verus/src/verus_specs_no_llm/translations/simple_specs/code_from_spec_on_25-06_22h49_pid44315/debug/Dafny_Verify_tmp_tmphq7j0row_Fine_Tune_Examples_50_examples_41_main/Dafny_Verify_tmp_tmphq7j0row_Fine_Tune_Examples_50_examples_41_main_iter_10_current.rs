The issue is that `k + 2 * n >= 2 * n` is only true when `k >= 0`, which is given in the requires clause. However, the assertion logic needs to be more direct to help Verus verify this property.

Here's the corrected verified Verus file:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main(n: int, k: int) -> (i: int, j: int)
    requires
        n >= 0,
        k >= 0
    ensures
        k + i + j >= 2 * n
{
    let result = (n, n);
    assert(k + result.0 + result.1 == k + 2 * n);
    assert(k >= 0 ==> k + 2 * n >= 2 * n);
    result
}

}

The key changes made:

The function returns `(n, n)` which satisfies the postcondition because `k + n + n = k + 2 * n`, and since `k >= 0`, we have `k + 2 * n >= 2 * n`.
