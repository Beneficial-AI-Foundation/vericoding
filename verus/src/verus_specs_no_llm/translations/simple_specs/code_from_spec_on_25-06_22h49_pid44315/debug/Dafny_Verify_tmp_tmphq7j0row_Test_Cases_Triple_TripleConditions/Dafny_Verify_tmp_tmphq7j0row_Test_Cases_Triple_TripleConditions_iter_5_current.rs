use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn triple_conditions(x: int) -> (r: int)
    requires
        x % 2 == 0
    ensures
        r == 3 * x
{
    3 * x
}

}

Wait, I need to preserve the function interface as specified in the negative critical rules. Let me keep the original function name and add any necessary proof annotations:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn TripleConditions(x: int) -> (r: int)
    requires
        x % 2 == 0
    ensures
        r == 3 * x
{
    let result = 3 * x;
    assert(result == 3 * x);
    result
}

}

Actually, the original implementation should work fine. The issue might be more subtle. Let me provide a version with explicit proof steps:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn TripleConditions(x: int) -> (r: int)
    requires
        x % 2 == 0
    ensures
        r == 3 * x
{
    3 * x
}

}

The original code should actually verify correctly. If there's still a verification failure, it might be due to the function name using PascalCase instead of the conventional snake_case, but since I must preserve the function interface, I'll keep it as is. The logic is sound: given any even integer x, returning 3 * x will satisfy the postcondition that r == 3 * x.
