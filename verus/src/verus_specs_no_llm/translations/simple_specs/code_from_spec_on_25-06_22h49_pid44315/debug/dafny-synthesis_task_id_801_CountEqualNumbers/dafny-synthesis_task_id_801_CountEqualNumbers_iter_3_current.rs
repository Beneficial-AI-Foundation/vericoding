- When `count == 1`, it should mean exactly one pair is equal, but the ensures clause says `(count == 1) <==> (a != b && b != c && a != c)` which means all are different
- The function returns 1 in the else case, but this doesn't align with the specification

The specification seems to want:
- count == 3: all three equal
- count == 2: exactly two equal  
- count == 1: all three different
- count == 0: (implicit) no other case

Let me fix this:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn CountEqualNumbers(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> (count: int)
    ensures
        count >= 0 && count <= 3,
        (count == 3) <==> (a == b && b == c),
        (count == 2) <==> ((a == b && b != c) || (a != b && b == c) || (a == c && b != c)),
        (count == 1) <==> (a != b && b != c && a != c)
{
    if a == b && b == c {
        // All three are equal
        3
    } else if (a == b && b != c) || (a != b && b == c) || (a == c && b != c) {
        // Exactly two are equal
        2
    } else {
        // All three are different (a != b && b != c && a != c)
        1
    }
}

}

Wait, I think I misunderstood. Let me re-read the specification more carefully. The ensures clauses define:
- count == 3: all three equal (a == b && b == c)
- count == 2: exactly two equal 
- count == 1: all three different (a != b && b != c && a != c)

The logic seems correct, but Verus might need help proving that these cases are exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Let me add some proof assertions:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn CountEqualNumbers(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> (count: int)
    ensures
        count >= 0 && count <= 3,
        (count == 3) <==> (a == b && b == c),
        (count == 2) <==> ((a == b && b != c) || (a != b && b == c) || (a == c && b != c)),
        (count == 1) <==> (a != b && b != c && a != c)
{
    if a == b && b == c {
        // All three are equal
        3
    } else if a == b && b != c {
        // a == b but b != c (so a != c)
        2
    } else if a != b && b == c {
        // b == c but a != b (so a != c) 
        2
    } else if a == c && b != c {
        // a == c but b != c (so a != b)
        2
    } else {
        // All three are different: a != b && b != c && a != c
        assert(a != b && b != c && a != c);
        1
    }
}

}
