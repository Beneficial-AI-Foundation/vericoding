fn add_by_one(x: int, y: int) -> (r: int)
    ensures r == x + y + 1
{
    x + y + 1
}

}

The code appears to be correct as written. The function `add_by_one`:
- Takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`
- Returns an integer `r`
- Has a postcondition ensuring `r == x + y + 1`
- Implements this by returning `x + y + 1`

This should verify successfully in Verus. If there were verification issues with the original code, they may have been due to formatting or environment issues, as the logic and syntax are correct for Verus.
