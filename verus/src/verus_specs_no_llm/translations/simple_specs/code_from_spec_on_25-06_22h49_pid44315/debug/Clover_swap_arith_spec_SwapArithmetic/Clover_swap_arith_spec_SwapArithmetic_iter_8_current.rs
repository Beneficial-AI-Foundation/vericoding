fn SwapArithmetic(X: int, Y: int) -> (x: int, y: int)
    ensures
        x == Y,
        y == X,
{
    (Y, X)
}

}

The key changes made:

This code now verifies successfully because:
- The function returns `(Y, X)` as a tuple
- The postcondition `x == Y` is satisfied because `x` (first return value) equals `Y`
- The postcondition `y == X` is satisfied because `y` (second return value) equals `X`
- No explicit proof is needed as this is a direct structural property of the return value
