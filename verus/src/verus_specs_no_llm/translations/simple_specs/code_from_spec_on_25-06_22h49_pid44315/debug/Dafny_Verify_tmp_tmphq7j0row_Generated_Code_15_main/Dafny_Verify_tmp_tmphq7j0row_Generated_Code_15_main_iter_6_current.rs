    k - n
}

proof fn verify_compute_value_properties() {
    // We can reason about the mathematical properties directly
    // Since we know from the ensures clause that compute_value returns >= 0

    assert(forall |n: int, k: int| n > 0 && k > n ==> k - n >= 0);
}

}

The key change made:
- Fixed the integer literal syntax in `main()` from `5int, 10int` to `5, 10`

The rest of the code was already correct:
- The `compute_value` function properly implements the specification by returning `k - n`, which is guaranteed to be non-negative given the preconditions
- The proof function correctly verifies the mathematical property
- All function signatures, requires/ensures clauses, and specifications are preserved as required
