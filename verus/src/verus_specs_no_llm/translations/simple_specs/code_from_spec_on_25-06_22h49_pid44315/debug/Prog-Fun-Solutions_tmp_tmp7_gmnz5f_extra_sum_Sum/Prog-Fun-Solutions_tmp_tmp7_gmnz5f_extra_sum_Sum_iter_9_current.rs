- The invariant says `total == sum(i)`, which initially holds since `total == 0` and `sum(0) == 0`
- In each iteration, we do `total = total + i` then `i = i + 1`
- For the invariant to hold after the update, we need `new_total == sum(new_i)`
- We have `new_total = old_total + old_i` and `new_i = old_i + 1`
- By the invariant before the update: `old_total == sum(old_i)`
- So `new_total = sum(old_i) + old_i`
- We need this to equal `sum(new_i) = sum(old_i + 1)`


This should work, but let me implement it with proper proof assertions to help Verus verify:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

spec fn sum(n: nat) -> int
    decreases n
{
    if n == 0 {
        0
    } else {
        sum(n - 1) + (n - 1) as int
    }
}

fn main() {
}

fn Sum(n: nat) -> (s: int)
    ensures
        s == sum(n)
{
    if n == 0 {
        return 0;
    }
    
    let mut total: int = 0;
    let mut i: nat = 0;
    
    while i < n
        invariant
            i <= n,
            total == sum(i),
        decreases n - i
    {
        // Proof assertion to help Verus understand the relationship
        assert(sum(i + 1) == sum(i) + i as int);
        
        total = total + i as int;
        i = i + 1;
        
        // Additional assertion to confirm invariant maintenance
        assert(total == sum(i));
    }
    
    total
}

}

The key insight is that `sum(i + 1) = sum(i) + i` based on the recursive definition of the spec function. The proof assertions help Verus understand this relationship and verify that the loop invariant is maintained correctly.
