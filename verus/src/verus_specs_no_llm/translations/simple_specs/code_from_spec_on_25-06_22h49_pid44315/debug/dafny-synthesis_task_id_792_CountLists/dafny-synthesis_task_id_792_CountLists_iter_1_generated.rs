The function has two ensures clauses:

The implementation is straightforward - I need to return the length of the input sequence `lists`. In Verus, `Seq<T>` has a `.len()` method that returns an `int`.

// Translated from Dafny
use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn CountLists(lists: Seq<Seq<int>>) -> (count: int)
    ensures
        count >= 0,
        count == lists.len()
{
    lists.len()
}

}

The implementation satisfies both postconditions:
- `count >= 0`: This is automatically satisfied because `Seq::len()` returns a non-negative integer by definition
- `count == lists.len()`: This is directly satisfied since we return `lists.len()`
