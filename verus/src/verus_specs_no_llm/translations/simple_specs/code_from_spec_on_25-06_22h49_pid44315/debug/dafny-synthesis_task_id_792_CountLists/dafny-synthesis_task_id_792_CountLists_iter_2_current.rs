fn main() {
}

fn CountLists(lists: Seq<Seq<int>>) -> (count: int)
    ensures
        count >= 0,
        count == lists.len()
{
    let count = lists.len();
    
    // Proof that sequence length is non-negative
    assert(count >= 0);
    
    count
}

}

The key changes made:

This should verify successfully as:
- `count == lists.len()` is satisfied by the assignment
- `count >= 0` is satisfied because sequence lengths are always non-negative in Verus, and the assert helps the verifier recognize this fact
