The issue is likely in the loop invariant verification. Let me fix this:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

spec fn sum_up_to(n: nat) -> nat
    decreases n
{
    if n == 0 {
        0
    } else {
        sum_up_to(n - 1) + (n - 1)
    }
}

fn SumUpTo(n: nat) -> (r: nat)
    ensures
        r == sum_up_to(n)
{
    let mut i: nat = 0;
    let mut sum: nat = 0;
    
    while i < n
        invariant
            i <= n,
            sum == sum_up_to(i),
        decreases n - i
    {
        sum = sum + i;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    
    sum
}

fn main() {
}

}

The key insight is that the loop invariant `sum == sum_up_to(i)` should hold throughout the loop execution. Let me trace through this:

- Initially: `i = 0`, `sum = 0`, and `sum_up_to(0) = 0` ✓
- After first iteration: `i = 1`, `sum = 0`, and `sum_up_to(1) = sum_up_to(0) + 0 = 0` ✓  
- After second iteration: `i = 2`, `sum = 1`, and `sum_up_to(2) = sum_up_to(1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` ✓
- And so on...

When the loop exits with `i == n`, we have `sum == sum_up_to(n)`, which satisfies the postcondition.

The code structure is correct, and this should verify properly with Verus.
