fn CubeSurfaceArea(size: int) -> (area: int)
    requires
        size > 0,
    ensures
        area == 6 * size * size,
{
    let area = 6 * size * size;
    area
}

}

The fix is simple - I've explicitly bound the result to a variable `area` and returned it. This helps Verus's verification process by making the computation more explicit. The original code was correct in logic, but Verus sometimes needs the computation to be structured this way for proper verification.

The function now:
