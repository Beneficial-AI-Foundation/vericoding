fn main() {
}

fn add_by_one(x: int, y: int) -> (r: int)
    requires
        y >= 0
    ensures
        r == x + y
{
    x + y
}

}

The changes I made:

The function should now verify correctly since:
- The precondition `y >= 0` is satisfied by the caller
- The postcondition `r == x + y` is satisfied by returning `x + y`
- The implementation matches the specification exactly
