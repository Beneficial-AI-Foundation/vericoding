- It requires `y >= 0`
- It ensures `r == x + y`
- The implementation returns `x + y`

The issue seems to be a mismatch between the function name and its specification. Since I must preserve the function interface and specifications, I'll keep the current behavior which adds `y` to `x`, as specified in the ensures clause.

The verification should actually pass as written, but let me provide a corrected version that ensures proper verification:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn add_by_one(x: int, y: int) -> (r: int)
    requires
        y >= 0
    ensures
        r == x + y
{
    x + y
}

}

Wait, looking at this more carefully, the code should actually verify correctly. The function takes `x` and `y`, requires `y >= 0`, ensures the result equals `x + y`, and returns `x + y`. This should satisfy the postcondition.

Let me provide the exact same code but ensure it's properly formatted:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn add_by_one(x: int, y: int) -> (r: int)
    requires
        y >= 0,
    ensures
        r == x + y,
{
    x + y
}

}

The only change I made was adding commas after the requires and ensures clauses, which is proper Verus syntax. This should now verify correctly.
