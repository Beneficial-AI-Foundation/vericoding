- `requires 0 <= N` - input must be non-negative
- `ensures i == 0` - result must be 0
- The loop invariant `0 <= current <= N` maintains that current stays in bounds
- The decreases clause `current` ensures termination

The logic looks correct - we start with `current = N`, decrement it while it's greater than 0, and return it (which should be 0). Let me provide the verified version:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn DownWhileGreater(N: int) -> (i: int)
    requires
        0 <= N
    ensures
        i == 0
{
    let mut current = N;
    while current > 0
        invariant 0 <= current <= N
        decreases current
    {
        current = current - 1;
    }
    current
}

}

The code should verify correctly as written. The function:
6. Therefore, the postcondition `i == 0` is satisfied

The verification should succeed with this implementation.
