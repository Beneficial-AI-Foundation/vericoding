fn DownWhileGreater(N: int) -> (i: int)
    requires
        0 <= N
    ensures
        i == 0
{
    let mut current = N;
    while current > 0
        invariant 0 <= current <= N
        decreases current
    {
        current = current - 1;
    }
    assert(current == 0); // Help Verus see that current must be 0 when loop exits
    current
}

}

The key addition is the `assert(current == 0)` statement after the loop. This helps Verus understand that when the loop condition `current > 0` becomes false, combined with the invariant `0 <= current <= N`, we must have `current == 0`.

The reasoning is:
6. Therefore, returning `current` satisfies the postcondition `i == 0`

This should now verify successfully.
