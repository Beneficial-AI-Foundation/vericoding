However, there's a more fundamental issue: the decreases clause should use a value that decreases and is non-negative. Since `n` can be negative or zero in the base case, we need to use a different approach.

Here's the corrected Verus file:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

// Specification function to define what Power means
spec fn Power(n: int) -> nat
    decreases n
{
    if n <= 0 {
        1
    } else {
        2 * Power((n - 1) as int)
    }
}

fn main() {
}

fn ComputePower(N: int) -> (y: nat)
    requires
        N >= 0
    ensures
        y == Power(N)
{
    if N == 0 {
        return 1;
    }
    
    let mut result: nat = 1;
    let mut i: int = 0;
    
    while i < N
        invariant
            0 <= i <= N,
            result == Power(i)
        decreases N - i
    {
        result = result * 2;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    
    return result;
}

}

Wait, let me reconsider this. The main issue is that Verus needs to prove termination for the recursive spec function. Since we're calling `Power(n-1)` when `n > 0`, and the base case is when `n <= 0`, the decreases clause should work with `n`. But we need to be more careful about the termination argument.

Let me fix this properly:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

// Specification function to define what Power means
spec fn Power(n: int) -> nat
{
    if n <= 0 {
        1nat
    } else {
        (2nat * Power(n - 1)) as nat
    }
}

fn main() {
}

fn ComputePower(N: int) -> (y: nat)
    requires
        N >= 0
    ensures
        y == Power(N)
{
    if N == 0 {
        1nat
    } else {
        let mut result: nat = 1nat;
        let mut i: int = 0;
        
        while i < N
            invariant
                0 <= i <= N,
                result == Power(i)
            decreases N - i
        {
            result = result * 2nat;
            i = i + 1;
        }
        
        result
    }
}

}
