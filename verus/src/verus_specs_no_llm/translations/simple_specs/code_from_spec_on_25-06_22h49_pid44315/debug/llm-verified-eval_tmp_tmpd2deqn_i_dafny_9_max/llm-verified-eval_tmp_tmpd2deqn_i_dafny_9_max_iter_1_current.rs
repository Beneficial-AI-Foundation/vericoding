The implementation:

   - The value must exist in the sequence (`numbers.contains(val)`)
   - The value must be greater than or equal to all elements in the sequence

   - Starts with the first element as the initial maximum
   - Iterates through the remaining elements
   - Updates the maximum whenever a larger element is found
   - Uses loop invariants to maintain verification conditions:
     - `i` stays within bounds
     - `max_val` is always an element from the sequence
     - `max_val` is greater than or equal to all elements seen so far

   - Changed `numbers != []` to `numbers.len() > 0` for proper Verus syntax
   - The postcondition `isMax(result, numbers)` is satisfied because after the loop, `max_val` contains an element from the sequence and is greater than or equal to all elements

The verification succeeds because the loop invariants ensure that upon termination, we have found the true maximum of the sequence.
