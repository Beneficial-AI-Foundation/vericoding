fn main() {
}

fn two(x: int) -> (y: int)
    ensures
        y == x + 1
{
    x + 1
}

}

The fix is simple - the function should directly return `x + 1` instead of using an intermediate variable. This directly satisfies the postcondition `y == x + 1` where `y` is the return value. Verus can easily verify that if we return `x + 1`, then indeed the return value equals `x + 1`.

The original code with the intermediate variable should also work, but the direct return is cleaner and more straightforward for verification.
