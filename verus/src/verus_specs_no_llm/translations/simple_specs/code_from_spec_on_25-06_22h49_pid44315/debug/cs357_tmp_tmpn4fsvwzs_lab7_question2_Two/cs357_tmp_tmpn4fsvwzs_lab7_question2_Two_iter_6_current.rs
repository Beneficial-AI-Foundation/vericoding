Let me analyze the specification more carefully. The ensures clause says `y == x + 1`, so the function should indeed return `x + 1`. The code looks correct, but let me provide a verified version:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn two(x: int) -> (y: int)
    ensures
        y == x + 1
{
    x + 1
}

}

Wait, looking at this again, the code appears to be correct as written. The function `two` takes an integer `x` and should return `x + 1` according to the postcondition, and that's exactly what it does.

If there's a verification error, it might be due to a subtle issue. Let me provide the corrected version with explicit proof annotations:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn two(x: int) -> (y: int)
    ensures
        y == x + 1
{
    let result = x + 1;
    assert(result == x + 1);
    result
}

}

Actually, the most straightforward approach that should verify is:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn two(x: int) -> (y: int)
    ensures
        y == x + 1
{
    x + 1
}

}

This should verify correctly because:

The code as provided should actually verify. If it's not verifying, there might be an environment or version issue with Verus itself.
