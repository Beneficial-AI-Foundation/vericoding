- The postcondition requires `r < students`, which means `0 < 1`, which is true
- However, Verus might not be able to automatically prove this arithmetic relationship

Let me fix this by adding an assertion to help Verus verify the postcondition:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn AssignmentsToMark(students: int, tutors: int) -> (r: int)
    requires
        students > 0 && tutors > 1
    ensures
        r < students
{
    let result = students - 1;
    assert(result < students);
    result
}

}
