fn AssignmentsToMark(students: int, tutors: int) -> (r: int)
    requires
        students > 0 && tutors > 1
    ensures
        r < students
{
    students - 1
}

}

This implementation:

The verification will succeed because:
- Given `students > 0` (from requires clause)
- We return `students - 1`
- Therefore `students - 1 < students` (satisfying the ensures clause)
