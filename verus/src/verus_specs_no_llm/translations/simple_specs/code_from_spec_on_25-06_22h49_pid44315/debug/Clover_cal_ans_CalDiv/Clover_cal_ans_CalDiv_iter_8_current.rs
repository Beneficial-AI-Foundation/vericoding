fn CalDiv() -> (x: int, y: int)
    ensures
        x == 191/7,
        y == 191%7
{
    let x: int = 27;  // 191 / 7 = 27 (integer division)
    let y: int = 2;   // 191 % 7 = 2 (remainder)
    
    // Add proof that our hardcoded values are correct
    assert(191 == 7 * 27 + 2);
    assert(x == 191/7);
    assert(y == 191%7);
    
    (x, y)
}

}

The key changes made:

This ensures that the function interface and specifications are preserved while fixing the verification issue. The function now correctly returns the integer division and remainder of 191 divided by 7, with the proper proof assertions to verify the correctness.
