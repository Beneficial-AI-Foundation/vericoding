Let me analyze the ensures clauses:
- `x == 191/7` means x should be the quotient of 191 divided by 7
- `y == 191%7` means y should be the remainder of 191 divided by 7

In Verus, integer division and modulo operations work the same as in most programming languages. I need to calculate:
- 191 ÷ 7 = 27 (quotient)
- 191 mod 7 = 2 (remainder)

Let me verify: 27 × 7 + 2 = 189 + 2 = 191 ✓

Here's the verified Verus implementation:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn CalDiv() -> (x: int, y: int)
    ensures
        x==191/7,
        y==191%7
{
    return (27, 2);
}

}

The implementation simply returns the literal values (27, 2) which satisfy the postconditions:
- x = 27 = 191/7
- y = 2 = 191%7

This approach works because the postconditions specify exact mathematical relationships, and since 191, 7, 27, and 2 are all compile-time constants, Verus can verify that these relationships hold.
