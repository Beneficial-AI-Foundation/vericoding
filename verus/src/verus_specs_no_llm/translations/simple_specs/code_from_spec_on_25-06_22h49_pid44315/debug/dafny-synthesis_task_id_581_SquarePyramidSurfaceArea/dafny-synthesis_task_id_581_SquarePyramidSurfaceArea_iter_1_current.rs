The function should return `baseEdge * baseEdge + 2 * baseEdge * height` according to the ensures clause.

Let me analyze the formula:
- `baseEdge * baseEdge` is the area of the square base
- `2 * baseEdge * height` represents the area of the four triangular faces

The implementation is straightforward - I just need to compute the expression from the ensures clause:

// Translated from Dafny
use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn SquarePyramidSurfaceArea(baseEdge: int, height: int) -> (area: int)
    requires
        baseEdge > 0,
        height > 0
    ensures
        area == baseEdge * baseEdge + 2 * baseEdge * height
{
    baseEdge * baseEdge + 2 * baseEdge * height
}

}

The implementation directly computes the required formula. Since the ensures clause specifies exactly what the return value should be, and we're computing that exact expression, Verus should be able to verify this automatically.
