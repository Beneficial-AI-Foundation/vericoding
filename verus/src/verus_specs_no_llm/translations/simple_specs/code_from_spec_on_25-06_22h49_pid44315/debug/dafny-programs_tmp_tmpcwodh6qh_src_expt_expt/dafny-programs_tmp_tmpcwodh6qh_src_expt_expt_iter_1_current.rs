I'll implement this using an iterative approach with a loop invariant to maintain the correctness proof:

// Translated from Dafny
use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn expt(b: int, n: nat) -> (res: int)
    ensures
        res == Expt(b, n)
{
    let mut result = 1;
    let mut i = 0;
    
    while i < n
        invariant
            0 <= i <= n,
            result == Expt(b, i),
    {
        result = result * b;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    
    result
}

}

The implementation works as follows:


   - `0 <= i <= n`: ensures the counter stays within bounds
   - `result == Expt(b, i)`: maintains that `result` always equals `b^i`

   - Multiply `result` by `b` (so `result` becomes `b^i * b = b^(i+1)`)
   - Increment `i` by 1
   - The invariant is preserved: new `result == Expt(b, new i)`


This iterative approach with proper loop invariants allows Verus to verify that the implementation correctly computes the exponentiation function.
