The issue is that the `ensures` clause is incomplete - it only specifies the constraint for `j` but not for `i`. Since the implementation returns `0` for `i`, I need to add that constraint to the ensures clause.

However, following the NEGATIVE CRITICAL RULES, I cannot change the function interface and specifications (including ensures and requires clauses). So I need to make the implementation match the existing specification.

The current specification only requires `j == 2 * x`, and the implementation `(2 * x, 0)` satisfies this (since `j` gets the value `2 * x`). The value of `i` is not constrained by the specification, so returning `0` for `i` should be fine.

Let me check if there might be another issue. The function signature and implementation look correct for Verus syntax. The issue might be that Verus needs to be able to verify that the returned tuple satisfies the ensures clause.

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main(x: int) -> (j: int, i: int)
    requires
        x > 0
    ensures
        j == 2 * x
{
    let result = (2 * x, 0);
    result
}

}
