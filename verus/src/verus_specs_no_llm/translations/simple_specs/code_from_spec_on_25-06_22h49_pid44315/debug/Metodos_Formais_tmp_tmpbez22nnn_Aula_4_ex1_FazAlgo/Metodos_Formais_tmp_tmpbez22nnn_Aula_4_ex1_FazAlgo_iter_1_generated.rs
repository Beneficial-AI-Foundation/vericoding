    n % 2 == 0
}

fn FazAlgo(a: int, b: int) -> (x: int, y: int)
    requires
        a >= b && Par(a-b)
{
    // Since there are no postconditions, we can return any valid integers
    // Let's return values based on the inputs to make it more meaningful
    let diff = a - b;
    return (diff / 2, a + b);
}

}

This implementation:

   - Calculates the difference `a - b` (which we know is even from the precondition)
   - Returns `diff / 2` as the first component (utilizing the fact that the difference is even)
   - Returns `a + b` as the second component

The function is now fully implemented and should verify successfully in Verus.
