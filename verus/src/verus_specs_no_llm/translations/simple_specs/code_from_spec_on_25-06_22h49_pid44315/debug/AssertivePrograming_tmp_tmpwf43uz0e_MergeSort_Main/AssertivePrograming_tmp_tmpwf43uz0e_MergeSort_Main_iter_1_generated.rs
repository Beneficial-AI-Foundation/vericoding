spec fn Sorted(q: Seq<int>) -> bool {
    forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i <= j < q.len() ==> q.spec_index(i) <= q.spec_index(j)
}

}

The only change I made was adding the proper quantifier syntax with explicit variable declarations `|i: int, j: int|` in the `forall` expression, which is the correct Verus syntax for universal quantification.

The specification correctly captures the notion of a sorted sequence: for any two indices i and j where i comes before or at the same position as j within the sequence bounds, the element at position i should be less than or equal to the element at position j.
