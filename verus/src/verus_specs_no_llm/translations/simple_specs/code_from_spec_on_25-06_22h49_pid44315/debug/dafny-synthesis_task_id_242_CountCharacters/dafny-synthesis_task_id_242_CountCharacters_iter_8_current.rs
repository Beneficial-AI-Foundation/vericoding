fn CountCharacters(s: Seq<char>) -> (count: int)
    ensures
        count >= 0,
        count == s.len()
{
    s.len() as int
}

}

The fix is simple: the `as int` cast should work correctly in Verus when converting from `nat` to `int`, since `nat` values are always non-negative integers. The ensures clauses are satisfied because:


This implementation correctly counts the number of characters in the sequence by returning its length, which matches the function's specification.
