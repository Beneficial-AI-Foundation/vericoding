fn CountCharacters(s: Seq<char>) -> (count: int)
    ensures
        count >= 0,
        count == s.len()
{
    s.len() as int
}

}

The key change is converting `s.len()` to `s.len() as int` to match the return type. Since `s.len()` returns a `nat` (which is always non-negative), casting it to `int` preserves the value and satisfies both postconditions:
- `count >= 0` is satisfied because `nat` values are always non-negative
- `count == s.len()` is satisfied because the cast preserves the value
