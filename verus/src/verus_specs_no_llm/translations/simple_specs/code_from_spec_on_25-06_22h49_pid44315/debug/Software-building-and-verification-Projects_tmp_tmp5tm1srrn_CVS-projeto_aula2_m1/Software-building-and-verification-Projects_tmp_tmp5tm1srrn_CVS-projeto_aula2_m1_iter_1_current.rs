Since `0 < x < y`, we know that `x >= 1` and `y >= 2`. The ensures clause requires that `z` is in the range `[0, y)` but `z != x`.

A simple solution is to return `0` when `x != 0`, or return `x + 1` when `x == 0`. However, since we know `x > 0`, we know `x != 0`, so returning `0` should work.

Let me verify:
- `z = 0`
- `z >= 0` ✓ (0 >= 0)
- `z < y` ✓ (since y > x > 0, we have y >= 2, so 0 < y)
- `z != x` ✓ (since x > 0, we have x >= 1, so 0 != x)

Here's the verified Verus file:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn m1(x: int, y: int) -> (z: int)
    requires
        0 < x < y
    ensures
        z >= 0 && z < y && z != x
{
    0
}

}

The implementation simply returns `0`, which satisfies all the postconditions:
