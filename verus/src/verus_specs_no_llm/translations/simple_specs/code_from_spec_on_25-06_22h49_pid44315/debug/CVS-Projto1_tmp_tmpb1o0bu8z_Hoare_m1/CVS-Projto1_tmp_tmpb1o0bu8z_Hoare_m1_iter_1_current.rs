Since `0 < x < y`, we know that `x >= 1` and `y >= 2`. The ensures clause requires that `z` is between 0 and y (inclusive) but not equal to x.

A simple solution is to return `y` when possible, or find another valid value. Since `x < y`, we know `y != x`, so returning `y` would satisfy `z != x` and `z <= y`. We also need `z >= 0`, but since `y > x > 0`, we have `y > 0`, so this is satisfied.

Let me implement this:

// Translated from Dafny
use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn m1(x: int, y: int) -> (z: int)
    requires
        0 < x < y
    ensures
        z >= 0 && z <= y && z != x
{
    y
}

}

This implementation works because:

All postconditions are satisfied.
