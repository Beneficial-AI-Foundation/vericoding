fn m1(x: int, y: int) -> (z: int)
    requires
        0 < x < y,
    ensures
        z >= 0 && z <= y && z != x,
{
    y
}

}

The key changes I made:

   - `z >= 0`: Since `0 < x < y`, we have `y > x > 0`, so `y > 0` ✓
   - `z <= y`: Since `z = y`, we have `y <= y` ✓  
   - `z != x`: Since `x < y`, we have `y != x` ✓

This implementation should verify correctly. The logic is sound: given that `0 < x < y`, returning `y` satisfies all the constraints since `y` is positive, equals itself, and is different from `x`.
