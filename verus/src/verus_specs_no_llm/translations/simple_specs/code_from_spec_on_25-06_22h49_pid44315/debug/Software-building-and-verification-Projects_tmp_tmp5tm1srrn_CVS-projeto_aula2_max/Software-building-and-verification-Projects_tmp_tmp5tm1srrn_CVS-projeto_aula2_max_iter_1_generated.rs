The postcondition `z >= a || z >= b` seems incorrect for a max function - it should be `z >= a && z >= b && (z == a || z == b)`. However, I must preserve the existing ensures clause as specified in the rules.

Let me analyze what the current postcondition requires: `z >= a || z >= b` means the result must be greater than or equal to at least one of the inputs. While this is a weak specification for max, I can implement a correct max function that will satisfy this condition (and actually be stronger than required).

// Translated from Dafny
use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn max(a: int, b: int) -> (z: int)
    requires
        true
    ensures
        z >= a || z >= b
{
    if a >= b {
        a
    } else {
        b
    }
}

}
