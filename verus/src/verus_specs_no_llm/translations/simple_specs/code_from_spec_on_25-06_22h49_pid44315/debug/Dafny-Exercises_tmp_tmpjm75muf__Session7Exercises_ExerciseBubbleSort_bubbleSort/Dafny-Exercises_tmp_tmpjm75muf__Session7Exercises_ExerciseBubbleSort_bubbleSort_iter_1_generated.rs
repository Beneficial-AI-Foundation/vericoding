The key changes I made to create a verified Verus implementation:

   - Changed `array<int>` to `&mut Vec<int>`
   - Fixed `Length` to `len()`
   - Added proper indexing with `as usize`
   - Fixed function signature to return `(result: bool)`

   - Handle empty range case first
   - Outer loop builds sorted prefix from left to right
   - Inner loop bubbles largest remaining element to its correct position
   - Use `set()` method for safe array updates

   - Length preservation
   - Boundary elements unchanged
   - Multiset preservation (elements not lost/gained)
   - Sorted property of processed portion
   - Proper ordering between sorted and unsorted portions
   - Bubbling property in inner loop

   - Used `recommends` instead of `requires` in spec function
   - Expanded the postcondition about unchanged elements into separate ensures clauses
   - Used proper Verus sequence operations like `subrange` and `multiset`

The implementation correctly sorts the segment `[c, f)` while preserving all elements outside this range and maintaining the multiset property.
