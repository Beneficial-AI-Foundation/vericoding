verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn Triple(x: int) -> (r: int)
    ensures r == 3 * x
{
    3 * x
}

}

The changes I made:


The function now has a clear specification that Verus can verify: it ensures that the returned value is exactly 3 times the input parameter. This makes the verification meaningful and should pass successfully.
