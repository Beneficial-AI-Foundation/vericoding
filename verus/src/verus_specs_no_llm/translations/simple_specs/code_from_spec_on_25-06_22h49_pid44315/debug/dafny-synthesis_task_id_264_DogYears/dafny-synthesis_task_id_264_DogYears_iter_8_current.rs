fn dog_years(human_years: int) -> (result: int)
    requires
        human_years >= 0,
    ensures
        result == 7 * human_years,
{
    7 * human_years
}

}

The key changes made:

This preserves all the original specifications (requires and ensures clauses) while fixing the compilation error. The function still correctly implements the dog years calculation (multiplying human years by 7) and maintains all the verification constraints.
