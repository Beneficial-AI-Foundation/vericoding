    // Proof that the postcondition holds
    assert(m == 0);
    assert(0 <= m); // Since m == 0
    assert(n > 0);  // From precondition
    assert(m < n);  // Since m == 0 and n > 0, we have 0 < n

}

The key insight is that:
6. Therefore: `(n <= 0) || (0 <= m && m < n)` is true (second disjunct is true)

The assertions help Verus understand the logical flow and verify that the postcondition is satisfied.
