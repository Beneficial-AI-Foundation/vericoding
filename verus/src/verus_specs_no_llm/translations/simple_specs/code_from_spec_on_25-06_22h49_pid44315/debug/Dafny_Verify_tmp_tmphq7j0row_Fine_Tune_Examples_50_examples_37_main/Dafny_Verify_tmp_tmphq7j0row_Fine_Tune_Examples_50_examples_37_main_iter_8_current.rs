    // Since n > 0 (from precondition) and m = 0, we have:
    // 0 <= m (since 0 <= 0)
    // m < n (since 0 < n when n > 0)
    // Therefore (0 <= m && m < n) is true

The implementation should work correctly. The postcondition `(n <= 0) || (0 <= m && m < n)` is satisfied because:

6. Since the second part of the disjunction is true, the entire postcondition is satisfied

The verification should pass with this implementation.
