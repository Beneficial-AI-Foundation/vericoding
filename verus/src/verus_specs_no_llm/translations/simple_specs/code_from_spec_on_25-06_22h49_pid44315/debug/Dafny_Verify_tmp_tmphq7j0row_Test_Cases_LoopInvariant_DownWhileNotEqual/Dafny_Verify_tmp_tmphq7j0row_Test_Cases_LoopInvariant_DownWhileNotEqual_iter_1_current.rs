The function name suggests it should count down from `N` while some condition is not equal, but the postcondition requires that the result must be 0. This means regardless of the input `N`, the function should always return 0.

Given the constraints:
- `requires 0 <= N` (N must be non-negative)
- `ensures i == 0` (result must be 0)

The simplest correct implementation is to just return 0, which already satisfies the postcondition.

Here's the verified Verus file:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn DownWhileNotEqual(N: int) -> (i: int)
    requires
        0 <= N
    ensures
        i == 0
{
    0
}

}

The implementation simply returns 0, which directly satisfies the postcondition `i == 0`. The precondition `0 <= N` is satisfied by the caller, and since we're not using `N` in any way that would violate this constraint, the function verifies correctly.
