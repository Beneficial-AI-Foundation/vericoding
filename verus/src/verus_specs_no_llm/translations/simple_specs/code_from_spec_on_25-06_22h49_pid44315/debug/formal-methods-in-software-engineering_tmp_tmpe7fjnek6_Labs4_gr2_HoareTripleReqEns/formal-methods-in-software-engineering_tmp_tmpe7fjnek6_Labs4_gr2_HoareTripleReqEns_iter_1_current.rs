fn HoareTripleReqEns(i: int, k: int) -> (k': int)
	// (| k == i*i |) k := k + 2 * i +1; (| k = (i+1)*(i+1) |)
    requires
        k == i*i
    ensures
        k' == (i+1)*(i+1)
{
    k + 2 * i + 1
}

}

The implementation simply performs the operation `k + 2 * i + 1`, which transforms `k` from `i*i` to `(i+1)*(i+1)` as required by the Hoare triple specification. The mathematical identity `(i+1)*(i+1) = i*i + 2*i + 1` ensures that the postcondition is satisfied when the precondition holds.
