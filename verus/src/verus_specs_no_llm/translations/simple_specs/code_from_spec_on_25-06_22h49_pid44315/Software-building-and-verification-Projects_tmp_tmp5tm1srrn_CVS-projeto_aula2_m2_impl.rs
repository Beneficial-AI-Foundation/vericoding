- `requires x <= -1` means x must be at most -1
- `ensures y > x` means the return value must be greater than x
- The implementation returns `x + 1`

The issue is that when `x <= -1`, returning `x + 1` should satisfy `y > x`, but Verus might need additional proof help to verify this. Let me provide a corrected version:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

// This function has impossible preconditions and postconditions
// Correcting to make it logically consistent
fn m2(x: int) -> (y: int)
    requires
        x <= -1
    ensures
        y > x
{
    let result = x + 1;
    assert(result == x + 1);
    assert(result > x);
    result
}

}

The fix includes:

This should now verify successfully as the mathematical relationship `x + 1 > x` holds for all integers, including those satisfying `x <= -1`.
