However, following the critical rule to preserve the ensures clause, I'll implement the function to satisfy the given specification. The issue is that the function body `x + 1` correctly implements the specification `y == x + 1`, so this should verify. Let me provide the corrected version:

use builtin::*;
use builtin_macros::*;

verus! {

fn main() {
}

fn two(x: int) -> (y: int)
    ensures
        y == x + 1
{
    x + 1
}

}

The code you provided should actually verify correctly as-is. The function `two` takes an integer `x` and returns `x + 1`, which satisfies the postcondition `y == x + 1`. 

If you're getting a verification failure, it might be due to:

The code as written is logically correct and should verify. The function body `x + 1` directly satisfies the ensures clause `y == x + 1`.
